N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age and is affected by various dietary factors. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between dietary diversity score (DDS) and the risk of PCOS. Our case-control study was conducted in the summer and autumn of 2019 in Taleghani and Arash hospitals in Tehran, Iran. A total of 494 participants (203 cases and 291 controls) were included in the study. Thereafter, their demographic information, dietary intake, and anthropometric and physical activity assessments were gathered. A validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was then used to calculate the DDS by scoring 5 food groups. To evaluate the risk of PCOS in association with DDS, the subjects were categorized based on the quartile cut-off points of the DDS. The mean +/- SD age of the participants in both the case and control groups was 28.98+/-5.43 and 30.15+/-6.21 years, while mean +/- SD body mass index was 25.74+/- 5.44 and 23.65+/- 3.90 kg/m2, respectively. The comparison between the case and control groups indicated that total DDS was 5.19 +/- 1.19 for the cases and 5.51+/- 1.19 for the controls. The comparison of DDS in the highest versus the lowest quartiles showed a decreased risk of PCOS (p < 0.05). We demonstrated an inverse association between DDS and PCOS compared with the control group. Furthermore, a higher DDS was significantly associated with a lower risk of PCOS (odds ratio = 0.40). Novelty: This is the first investigation on the relationship between DDS and PCOS. Results depicted an inverse relationship between DDS and PCOS.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the possible effects of low-frequency electroacupuncture (EA) and physical exercise on markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis, insulin sensitivity, and adipose tissue characteristics in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Secondary analyses of a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. Setting(s): Department of Physiology and Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Gothenburg. Patient(s): Eighty-four women with PCOS were randomized. Intervention(s): Women with PCOS were randomized to 16 weeks of low-frequency EA (14 treatments), physical exercise (at least 3 times/wk), or no intervention. Main Outcome Measure(s): Anthropometrics, circulating coagulation and fibrinolytic markers, insulin sensitivity (euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp), hemodynamics, and adipose tissue morphology/function recorded at baseline, after 16 weeks of intervention, and after a 16-week follow-up. Result(s): In the low-frequency EA group, circulating plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 activity decreased by 21.8% after 16 weeks of intervention and by 31.1% at the 16-week follow-up and differed from the physical exercise and the no intervention groups. The EA group had decreases in circulating fibrinogen and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), sagittal diameter, and diastolic blood pressure after treatment, and fibrinogen remained lower at the 16-week follow-up. In the physical exercise group, lipoprotein lipase activity increased and diastolic blood pressure decreased after treatment, and both diastolic and systolic blood pressure were lower at follow-up. No other variables were affected. Conclusion(s): Low-frequency EA counteracted a possible prothrombotic state in women with PCOS, as reflected by a decrease in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 activity. Despite within-group improvements, there were no between-group differences in anthropometric, metabolic, or hemodynamic variables after 16 weeks of EA or physical exercise at the dose/intensity studied. © 2012 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Objective: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH diet) on weight loss, anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and metabolic profiles in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design, Patients and Measurements:: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted among 60 overweight or obese patients with PCOS. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either low-calorie DASH (N=30) or control diet (N=30) for 12 weeks. The DASH and control diets were consisted of 52%-55% carbohydrates, 16%-18% proteins and 30% total fats; however, the DASH diet was designed to be rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, cholesterol and refined grains. Both diets were equicaloric. Result(s): Adherence to the DASH diet, compared to the control diet, resulted in a significant decrease in BMI (-1.6+/-0.5 vs -1.2+/-0.7 kg/m2, P=.02). Significant decreases in AMH (-1.1+/-3.1 vs +0.3+/-0.7 ng/mL, P=.01), insulin (-25.2+/-51.0 vs -1.2+/-28.8 pmol/L, P=.02), homoeostasis model of assessment-estimated insulin resistance (-0.9+/-2.0 vs -0.1+/-1.0, P=.02), free androgen index (FAI; -0.03+/-0.09 vs +0.06+/-0.21, P=.02) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (-0.5+/-0.4 vs +0.2+/-0.3 mumol/L, P<.001), and significant increases in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (+0.01+/-0.03 vs -0.004+/-0.01, P=.02), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG; +3.7+/-8.5 vs -1.5+/-7.2 nmol/L, P=.01) and nitric oxide (NO; +9.0+/-4.9 vs +0.6+/-2.3 mumol/L, P<.001) were also seen in the DASH group compared with the control group. Conclusion(s): Adherence to the DASH diet for 12 weeks among PCOS women had beneficial effects on BMI, AMH, insulin metabolism, SHBG, FAI, NO and MDA levels.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

T1  - 'I'm usually being my own doctor': women's experiences of managing polycystic ovary syndrome in Canada
A1  - Ismayilova M.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex, chronic condition characterized by anovulation, polycystic ovarian morphology and hyperandrogenism that requires lifelong management. To reduce the risk of comorbidity and to manage symptoms, lifestyle management and pharmaceuticals such as oral contraceptives are the most common forms of treatment and should be tailored to the individual patient. The literature to date has shown PCOS patients to experience widespread dissatisfaction with the amount and quality of information they receive from providers, along with lower levels of trust in physicians. Little is known about the lived experiences of women managing PCOS in Canada, across age groups. METHOD(S): In-depth remote interviews explored women's lived experiences managing PCOS and the barriers and facilitators they encountered in their management journeys. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis and interpretive description methodology. RESULT(S): Twenty-five in-depth, telephone interviews conducted with participants (aged 18-63 y) across Canada revealed participants lacking sufficient information and guidance from physicians, especially in primary care. Areas in need of more guidance included lifestyle management and mental health. Lack of empathy and weight bias among physicians were also perceived by participants. Older participants received little guidance on treatment options postmenopause. Loss of trust and withdrawal from seeking medical care were prominent themes, along with greater self-reliance on self-management, including self-educating and self-experimenting with treatments. CONCLUSION(S): Most women in this study were frustrated with the level of involvement and information provision from their doctors. Key recommendations are identified for the provision of care to younger and older patients with PCOS. Improved education for physicians may be needed to improve the quality of healthcare provision for PCOS.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

N2  - PURPOSE: Exercise training is recommended to improve cardiometabolic health and fertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), yet there are few randomized controlled trials on the effects of different exercise protocols on clinical reproductive outcomes. Our aim was to determine the effect of high-intensity interval training (HIT) on menstrual frequency, as a proxy of reproductive function, in women with PCOS. METHOD(S): The IMPROV-IT study was a two-center randomized controlled trial undertaken in Norway and Australia. Women with PCOS were eligible for inclusion. After stratification for body mass index <27 or >=27 kg.m-2 and study center, participants were randomly allocated (1:1:1) to high-volume HIT (HV-HIT), low-volume HIT (LV-HIT), or a control group. Measurements were assessed at baseline, after the 16-wk exercise intervention, and at 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome was menstrual frequency after 12 months. Secondary outcomes included markers of cardiometabolic and reproductive health, quality of life, and adherence to and enjoyment of HIT. RESULT(S): We randomly allocated 64 participants to the HV-HIT (n = 20), LV-HIT (n = 21), or control group (n = 23). There were no differences in menstrual frequency at 12 months between the LV-HIT and control groups (frequency ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-1.42), the HV-HIT and control groups (frequency ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.67-1.29), or the LV-HIT and HV-HIT groups (frequency ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.77-1.56). Menstrual frequency increased in all groups from baseline to 12 months. More participants became pregnant in the LV-HIT group (n = 5) than in the control group (n = 0, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION(S): A semisupervised HIT intervention did not increase menstrual frequency in women with PCOS.Clinical Trial Registration Number:ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02419482).Copyright © 2022 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

N2  - The results of epidemiological studies involving n-3 PUFA and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are scarce. This matched case-control study assessed the associations between n-3 PUFA and PCOS prevalence in 325 pairs of PCOS cases and healthy controls. Dietary information was assessed using a 102-item FFQ. Fatty acids in serum phospholipids were measured with a GC method. We found that n-3 PUFA in serum phospholipids were inversely associated with PCOS prevalence, including total, long-chain and individual PUFA (e.g. docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), EPA and DHA). Compared with the lowest tertile (T1), the adjusted OR and their 95% CI for the highest tertile (T3) were 0.63 (0.40, 0.93) for total n-3 PUFA, 0.60 (0.38, 0.92) for long-chain n-3 PUFA, 0.68 (0.45, 1.01) for DHA, 0.70 (0.45, 1.05) for EPA and 0.72 (0.45, 1.08) for DPA. For dietary intake of n-3 PUFA, significant inverse associations were found only for long-chain n-3 PUFA (P trend = 0.001), EPA (P trend = 0.047) and DHA (P trend = 0.030). Both dietary and serum n-3 PUFA, mainly EPA and DPA, were negatively correlated with PCOS-related parameters, such as BMI, fasting insulin, total testosterone and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, but positively correlated with follicle-stimulating hormone and sex hormone-binding globulin. These results indicated inverse associations between n-3 PUFA, especially long-chain n-3 PUFA, and PCOS prevalence. Higher intakes of n-3 PUFA might be considered a protective factor for PCOS among Chinese females.Copyright © 2022 Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

N2  - The pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remains unclear; however, inflammation is involved in PCOS progression and can be regulated by diet. We therefore hypothesized that diet may play an important role in the process of PCOS. This study aimed to investigate specific dietary patterns associated with PCOS through a case-control study involving 527 participants and conducted in Fuzhou, China. The dietary inflammatory index (DII) was calculated using a dietary frequency questionnaire, and the dietary pattern was obtained through a principal component analysis (PCA). Logistic regression was used for risk estimation, and the correlations were investigated by partial correlation analysis. The PCA identified a Mediterranean diet, a meat-egg diet, a shellfish-shrimp-dairy diet, and a staple food-soybean diet. The meat-egg (odds ratio [OR] = 1.404; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.163-1.695) and shellfish-shrimp-dairy (OR = 1.287; 95% CI, 1.057-1.568) diets increased the risk of PCOS. The Mediterranean diet (OR = 0.759; 95% CI, 0.624-0.922) was identified as a protective factor and was negatively correlated with the DII. The DII scores ranged from -4.64 to 4.79 and were positively correlated with the risk of PCOS (OR = 1.141; 95% CI, 1.050-1.240). After adjusting for covariates, the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and DII were positively correlated in PCOS (P < .001, P = .001, and P < .001, respectively). In conclusion, certain dietary patterns are associated with PCOS. Pro-inflammatory diets increase the risk of PCOS, and the DII was negatively correlated with the Mediterranean diet and positively correlated with the PLR, NLR, and SII.Copyright © 2022

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: Does 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) result in greater improvements in cardio-metabolic and reproductive outcomes compared to standard moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? SUMMARY ANSWER: HIIT offers greater improvements in aerobic capacity, insulin sensitivity and menstrual cyclicity, and larger reductions in hyperandrogenism compared to MICT. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Exercise training is recognized to improve clinical outcomes in women with PCOS, but little is known about whether HIIT results in greater health outcomes compared to standard MICT. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a two-armed randomized clinical trial enrolling a total of 29 overweight women with PCOS between May 2016 and November 2019. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women with PCOS aged 18-45 years were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of either MICT (60-75% peak heart rate, N = 14) or HIIT (>90% peak heart rate, N = 15), each completed three times per week. The primary clinical outcomes were aerobic capacity (VO2peak) and insulin sensitivity (euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp). Secondary outcomes included hormonal profiles, menstrual cyclicity and body composition. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Both HIIT and MICT improved VO2peak (HIIT; DELTA5.8 +/- 2.6 ml/kg/min, P < 0.001 and MICT; DELTA3.2 +/- 2 ml/kg/min, P < 0.001), however, the HIIT group had a greater improvement in aerobic capacity compared to MICT (beta = 2.73 ml/kg/min, P = 0.015). HIIT increased the insulin sensitivity index compared to baseline (DELTA2.3 +/- 4.4 AU, P = 0.007) and MICT (beta = 0.36 AU, P = 0.030), and caused higher increases in sex hormone-binding globulin compared to MICT (beta = 0.25 nmol/l, P = 0.002). HIIT participants were 7.8 times more likely to report improved menstrual cyclicity than those in the MICT group (odds ratio 7.8, P = 0.04). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study has a small sample size and the findings of the effect of the exercise interventions are limited to overweight reproductive-aged women, who do not have any co-existing co-morbidities that require medication. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Exercise, regardless of intensity, has clear health benefits for women with PCOS. HIIT appears to be a more beneficial strategy and should be considered for promoting health and reducing cardio-metabolic risk in overweight women with PCOS.

N2  - Research question: Do women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a different fat intake pattern to women without PCOS? Design: Case-control study of 276 women between 20 and 35 years old from the Murcia region of Spain. Cases (n = 121) attended the Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of the University Clinical Hospital and were diagnosed with PCOS using Rotterdam criteria. Controls (n = 155) were women without PCOS attending the gynaecological outpatient clinic for routine gynaecological examinations. Data from clinical, gynaecological and analytical examinations were collected, including a food frequency questionnaire. Associations between fat intake and presence of PCOS and its phenotypes were examined using multiple logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounding factors. Result(s): Although no association was found between fatty acid intake and PCOS, significant associations were observed for some PCOS phenotypes. The PCOS phenotype characterized by hyperandrogenism + oligo/amenorrhoea + polycystic ovarian morphology ('H+O+POM') was significantly associated with a higher intake of polyunsaturated fat (odds ratio [OR] 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-14.2; fourth quartile of highest intake [Q4] versus lowest intake quartile as reference [Q1]) and omega-6 fatty acids (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.01-12.4; Q3 versus Q1). The 'H+O' phenotype was positively associated with saturated fat intake (OR 6.9; 95% CI 1.1-41.6; Q4 versus Q1). Conclusion(s): This exploratory study suggests that higher intakes of specific fatty acids are related to some PCOS phenotypes although no association was found for PCOS on a global basis. It is recommended that studies with larger sample size be performed to further explore these associations, thus contributing to establishing recommendations about fat intake adapted to different PCOS phenotypes.Copyright © 2021

N2  - Context: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Both PCOS and MetS are associated with excess weight. Objective(s): To examine the effect of a three-component lifestyle intervention (LSI) with or without short message service (SMS+ or SMS-, respectively) on the prevalence and severity of MetS and metabolic parameters, compared to care as usual (CAU). Design(s): Randomized controlled trial. Method(s): Women diagnosed with PCOS and a BMI >25 kg/m2 (n = 183) were either assigned to a 1-year three-component (cognitive behavioural therapy, diet, and exercise) LSI, with or without SMS support, or to CAU which provided weight-loss advice only. Main outcome measures included changes in the prevalence of MetS, the continuous MetS severity z-score (cMetS z-score), metabolic parameters, and the impact of weight loss. Result(s): After 1 year, the decrease in the cMetS z-score was greater in the SMS+ group than the CAU group (-0.39, P = 0.015). The prevalence of MetS changed with -21.6% (P = 0.037), -16.5% (P = 0.190), and +7.0% (P = 0.509) in both LSI groups and CAU group, respectively. A post hoc analysis for both LSI groups combined vs CAU resulted in a MetS difference of -25.9% (P = 0.046). Moreover, weight loss per se resulted in significantly favourable effects on all metabolic parameters. Conclusion(s): This three-component LSI was more successful in improving metabolic health compared to CAU. Therefore, we recommend this intervention to women with PCOS and excess weight, provided that a clinically relevant weight loss is being pursued.Copyright © 2022 The authors

N2  - Introduction: The association between diet and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) might be mediated by the inflammatory properties of the diet. The study aimed to investigate the relationships between the dietary inflammatory index (DII) with odds of PCOS among the adult population. Method(s): In the hospital-based case-control study, 203 patients with PCOS and 291 non-PCOS controls were enroled. DII was calculated via a validated 147-item quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Thirty-six macro- and micronutrients were extracted from FFQ and used to calculate DII. Employing a case-control design, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained, with a dose-response effect confirmed by the test for trend (p for trend). Result(s): The mean +/- SD age and body mass index (BMI) of the study participants were 29.67 +/- 5.92 years and 24.51 +/- 4.71 kg/m2, respectively. Compared with controls subjects, PCOS patients had significantly higher weight, BMI, and waist circumferences, but had lower physical activity. PCOS subjects had higher intakes of carbohydrate, cholesterol, and refined grains, but lower intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids, fibre, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and dairy as compared to controls. Compared with participants in the lowest quartile of DII, those in the highest quartile had a significantly higher OR for PCOS after further adjustment for potential confounders (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 0.95-3.22). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that high DII was associated with an increased odds of PCOS diagnosis. Prospective dietary intervention studies and observational prospective cohorts are required to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Background: There is paucity of data related to dietary patterns in women with PCOS with heterogenous phenotypes compared to weight matched healthy women. In the present study, we studied the influence of diet and dietary patterns in relation to BMI and phenotype of PCOS women. Design(s): Case control study in a tertiary care hospital. Patient(s): 168 PCOS women and 102 age matched healthy women were recruited. All were subjected to clinical examination, biochemical, hormonal and dietary assessment based on 2-day dietary recall and direct interview by dieticians. Result(s): There was no difference in the total energy and macronutrient distribution among the lean and obese PCOS women compared to weight matched controls. There was a higher junk intake and lower fibre intake among PCOS patients compared to controls. There was no difference in the total energy or macronutrient distribution or meal timings among different phenotypes of PCOS. Around 40% PCOS women had a late/missed breakfast pattern compared to 15% of healthy controls (p-0.00). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, we observed that late breakfast and late lunch patterns were associated with PCOS independent of BMI (OR-3.3[CI- 1.7-6.8] and 3.0 [CI- 1.2-6.9]). Junk intake was correlated with BMI, glucose and cholesterol levels and dairy intake was correlated with hirsuitism score. Conclusion(s): We demonstrate for the first time that PCOS women differ significantly from weight matched controls in the timings of their breakfast and lunch intake rather than the total caloric intake and macronutrient distribution. Whether correction of meal timings and food choices can improve the phenotypic manifestations of PCOS remains to be seen.Copyright © 2021

N2  - The roles of dietary macronutrients and physical activity (PA) in patients with PCOS have not been sufficiently reported, especially in adolescent girls. To address this knowledge gap, we evaluated the associations between serum concentrations of total testosterone (tT), free testosterone (fT), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and dietary macronutrients intake as well as different types and levels of PA. The study population consisted of 96 girls of Caucasian ancestry, aged 14-18 years: 61 participants with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and 35 healthy controls. Serum tT, fT, A, DHEA-S, and SHBG were determined in fasting blood. Macronutrient intake and PA levels were assessed by using the three-day food record method and the Beliefs and Eating Habits Questionnaire (KomPAN), respectively. We found several positive correlations between dietary macronutrients such as total fat, saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and hormonal parameters across the entire cohort and in healthy girls. A positive correlation between SHBG and total protein consumption as well as an inverse correlation between SHBG and carbohydrate intake could be determined. No correlation between androgens and macronutrients was found in the PCOS group. In contrast, we observed an inverse correlation between androgen concentrations (except of DHEA-S) and "work/school" and/or "leisure time" PA only in PCOS patients. Moreover, the hormone levels differed according to PA intensity. In conclusion, the impact of diet and PA was strikingly different in adolescents with and without PCOS. These findings indicate that disturbed hormonal homeostasis in PCOS, at least in the youngest patients, likely "overtrump" dietary influences, and otherwise, PA offers a therapeutic potential that requires further evaluation of the long-term effects in randomized studies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition affecting up to 13% of reproductive-aged women. Weight and lifestyle management are key initial treatment strategies for individuals with PCOS, as recommended in international evidence-based guidelines. Allied health professionals, including dietitians, exercise physiologists, and psychologists, are crucial in delivering support for lifestyle and weight management. OBJECTIVE(S): Our aim was to explore the barriers and enablers to lifestyle and weight management for individuals with PCOS from the perspectives of allied health professionals. DESIGN: This was a qualitative study using a phenomenology approach to understand the allied health professionals lived experiences managing the lifestyles of individuals with PCOS. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with allied health professionals (ie, dietitians, exercise physiologists, and psychologist). Interviews were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed. Transcripts were coded inductively and analyzed thematically. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants were 15 allied health professionals (ie, 9 dietitians, 5 exercise physiologists, and 1 psychologist) involved in the management of PCOS in Australia (n = 10 in Victoria, n = 5 in other states) and interviewed between June and September 2019. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Barriers and enablers of allied health professionals relating to the provision of lifestyle and weight management in individuals with PCOS were analyzed. RESULT(S): Barriers relating to individuals with PCOS included insufficient knowledge on lifestyle management; lack of time; socioeconomic disadvantage preventing access to lifestyle support; and psychological issues, such as eating disorders or depression. Barriers relating to health professionals included insufficient knowledge about PCOS and insufficient time during consultation. Barriers relating to the health system included lifestyle recommendations in the PCOS guidelines that are too general and weight-focused, funding system that does not facilitate long-term care, and low integration of care among health professionals. CONCLUSION(S): Barriers for the individual, health professional, and health system all need to be addressed to improve the implementation of lifestyle management in PCOS care to optimize consistency with the PCOS international evidence-based guidelines.Copyright © 2022 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

N2  - We performed this case-control study with 303 polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients and 588 age-matched controls to evaluate the relation between fertility diet score and odds of PCOS. In a fully adjusted model, the top tertile of fertility diet score compared to the bottom was associated with 22% [95%CI 0.71-0.93] lower odds of PCOS (P trend = 0.012). Ratio of monounsaturated to trans fat and vegetable protein was associated with a lower odd of PCOS. Animal protein intake and glycemic load were associated with a higher odd of PCOS. Based on our results, increasing the quality of the diet according to fertility diet score can reduce the odds of PCOS.

N2  - Metabolic and hormonal outcomes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have implications on telomere biology and physical activity may prevent telomere erosion. We sought to observe the effects of continuous (CAT) and intermittent (IAT) aerobic training on telomere length, inflammatory biomarkers, and its correlation with metabolic, hormonal, and anthropometric parameters of PCOS. This randomized controlled clinical trial study included 87 PCOS randomly stratified ac-cording to body mass index (BMI) in CAT (n = 28), IAT (n = 29) and non-training control group (CG, n = 30). The exercises were carried out on a treadmill, three times per week for 16 weeks. The par-ticipants' anthropometric characteristics and biochemical and hormonal concentrations were measured before and after aerobic training or observation period, as the telomere length that was evalu-ated using quantitative real-time PCR. Four months of aerobic exercises (CAT or IAT) did not alter telomere length and inflammatory biomarkers in PCOS women. Obesity index as BMI and waist circumference (WC), and inflammatory biomarkers negatively affect telomeres. The hyper-andro-genism measured by testosterone levels was reduced after both exercises (CAT, p <= 0.001; IAT, p = 0.019). In particular, the CAT reduced WC (p = 0.045), hip circumference (p = 0.032), serum cholesterol (p <= 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein (p = 0.030). Whereas, the IAT decreased WC (p = 0.014), waist-to-hip ratio (p = 0.012), free androgen index (FAI) (p = 0.037). WC (p = 0.049) and body fat (p = 0.015) increased in the non-training group while total cholesterol was reduced (p = 0.010). Booth exercises reduced obesity indices and hyperandrogenism on PCOS women without changes in te-lomere length or inflammatory biomarkers.Copyright © 2021 by the author.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as one of the significant endocrine disorders, is common among women worldwide. Food insecurity (FI) and unhealthy dietary patterns can negatively affect reproductive health. The effects of the lifestyle modifications, especially dietary components, on PCOS are contradictory. The aim was the assessment of association between PCOS with food security status and dietary patterns among overweight or obese women. Method(s): This case-control study was performed on 240 overweight and obese women with and without PCOS (ratio 1:1) referred to the infertility clinic of Arash Hospital, Tehran, Iran. The general and socioeconomic characteristics, anthropometrics (weight, height, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference), physical activity, food security status, and dietary intakes (or patterns) were assessed using valid questionnaires, scales, stadiometer, and tape meter. The significant p-value was < 0.05. Result(s): The prevalence of FI was 60% in women with PCOS and 30% in healthy women. PCOS risk was positively related to FI, quasi-western dietary patterns, low economic levels, waist circumference, and menstrual age and negatively with physical activity and healthy dietary patterns, even after controlling the potential confounders (P < 0.05). PCOS women had a higher intake of saturated fats, monounsaturated fats, oleic acid, fluorine, sucrose, and caffeine and a lower intake of vitamins A, B5, B6, B12, C, and D, potassium, proteins, carbohydrates, cholesterols, docosahexaenoic acid, potassium, carotenes, lutein, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, calcium, iron, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, tetra- and dihydrofolate, biotin, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, copper, fiber (total, insoluble, and crude), glucose, galactose, fructose, and lactose compared to the healthy women (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): FI, quasi-western dietary patterns, low economic levels, and waist circumference were significantly associated with the higher risk of PCOS. The lifestyle changes, especially dietary patterns, may be an essential strategy for reducing PCOS. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and to identify the underlying mechanisms.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common heterogeneous endocrine disorder companied with neuroendocrine and metabolic disorders. Gut microbiota has been implicated to play a key role in metabolic diseases and the production of neurotransmitters. Previous studies have reported the alterations in the gut microbiota of PCOS patients and animal models, however, most of the articles did not take the effect of age or diet on gut microbiota into account. The aim of this study was to identify the differential gut microbial species in PCOS patients compared with age and BMI-matched healthy control women. Method(s): We performed physical examinations and dietary survey in 20 women with PCOS (lean PCOS, PL, n = 10; overweight PCOS, PO, n = 10) and 20 healthy control women (lean control, CL, n = 10; overweight control, CO, n = 10), and collected the blood on the days 1-3 of the menstrual cycle for the measurement of endocrine and metabolic profiles, and inflammatory factors; and collected the feces in non-menstrual period to investigate the composition of gut microbiota by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene in fecal samples. The correlations between clinical parameters and the differential species were evaluated. Result(s): Dietary analysis showed that the intake of dietary fiber, vitamin D were significantly decreased in PCOS. For the first time, our study found an increase of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-producing species in PCOS, including Parabacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli, which significantly positively correlated with serum LH levels and LH:FSH ratios. Conclusion(s): GABA-producing bacteria that were increased in PCOS, including Parabacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli, showed positive relationship with serum LH levels and LH:FSH ratios. In conclusion, gut microbial dysbiosis in women with PCOS is associated with neuroendocrine changes, revealing a potential gut-brain axis in PCOS.Copyright © 2021, Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Current evidence supports the adoption of healthy diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), given the positive effects of those behaviors on physical well-being. An improved understanding of the associations between diet and PA with PCOS is needed to ascertain whether tailored dietary and PA recommendations are needed for this population. Thus, we investigated the associations of diet and PA with PCOS and its isolated features. METHOD(S): Cross-sectional study. Of the 748 women who were included in this study from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Women's Study, 40 were classified as having PCOS, 104 had isolated hyperandrogenism (HA) and 75 had isolated oligomenorrhea (OA). Dietary intake was measured using the CARDIA diet history questionnaire and diet quality was scored using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010; a higher score indicated a better quality diet. Self-reported PA was measured using a validated interviewer-administered questionnaire. Polytomous logistic regression analyses examined the associations between diet and PA with PCOS, HA, and OA status (outcomes), adjusting for age, race, total energy intake, education, and/or body mass index. The threshold for statistical significance was set at p<0.05. RESULT(S): Mean age of the participants was 25.4years (SD 3.6) and 46.8% of participants were Black women. There was little to no association of total energy intake, nutrients, diet quality, and PA with PCOS, HA or OA status. CONCLUSION(S): Energy intake, nutrient composition, diet quality, and PA were not associated with PCOS, supporting recent PCOS guidelines of using national recommendations for the general population to encourage health-promoting behaviors among women with PCOS. However, longitudinal studies evaluating changes in diet and physical activity in relation to the development and/or the progression of PCOS are needed to establish a causal association.

N2  - To personalize lifestyle advice for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and obesity, detailed information regarding dietary intake, eating behavior, physical activity levels, and quality of life (QoL) may be useful. We aimed to investigate in a post-hoc cross-sectional analysis within a large multicenter randomized controlled trial in women with infertility whether there are significant differences in dietary intake (vegetables, fruits, sugary drinks, alcoholic beverages, savory snacks, and sweet snacks); eating behavior (emotional eating, external eating, and restricted eating); physical activity; and QoL between women with PCOS and obesity and non-PCOS obese controls. Participants were asked to complete the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), the Short QUestionnaire to ASsess Health-enhancing physical activity (SQUASH), and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) at study entry (PCOS: n = 170; non-PCOS: n = 321, mean BMI: 36). Linear and binary (multinomial) logistic regressions were used, and the analyses were adjusted for age, waist-hip circumference ratio, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). No statistically significant differences in dietary intake or physical activity were observed between the two groups. The overall score of emotional eating was 34.6 +/- 11.2 in the PCOS group and 34.1 +/- 11.3 in the non-PCOS group (p = 0.11). QoL scores (physical and mental) did not differ between PCOS and non-PCOS women. These findings suggest that infertile women with PCOS and obesity and infertile non-PCOS obese controls do not have different dietary habits and have similar mental and physical QoL.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Little is known about the difference in effectiveness of lifestyle intervention between women with PCOS and non-PCOS women. In a post hoc longitudinal analysis of a random-ized, controlled trial, we aimed to investigate whether infertile women with PCOS and obesity (N = 87) responded differently to a 6-month lifestyle intervention program than infertile non-PCOS obese controls (N = 172). We evaluated several aspects of the intervention such as changes in diet, physical activity, and dropout rate, as well as the effect on weight, quality of life (QoL), and cardiometabolic outcomes. Multilevel analyses were used, and analyses were adjusted for baseline characteristics such as age, education, and smoking. Although BMI in both groups significantly decreased at 3 months and 6 months, there were no significant differences between the groups at 3 months (adjusted B: -0.3, 95% CI: -0.9 to 0.3, p = 0.35) and 6 months (adjusted B: 0.5, 95% CI: -0.4 to 1.4, p = 0.29). Women with PCOS and non-PCOS women had similar compliance with the lifestyle intervention in terms of actual change in diet and physical activity. Mental QoL scores were not different at either 3 or 6 months. Physical QoL scores were lower in women with PCOS compared with non-PCOS women at 3 months (adjusted B: -2.4, 95% CI: -4.8 to -0.06, p = 0.045) but not at 6 months. Cardiometabolic parameters did not differ between the groups. Our results showed that infertile women with PCOS and obesity and non-PCOS obese controls responded largely similarly to our lifestyle intervention and achieved the same level of improvement in markers of cardiometabolic health.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Vitamin D (VD) might play an important role in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and female fertility. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) is sparse. We examined VD effects on anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and other endocrine markers in PCOS and nonPCOS women. This is a post hoc analysis of a single-center, double-blind RCT conducted between December 2011 and October 2017 at the endocrine outpatient clinic at the Medical University of Graz, Austria. We included 180 PCOS women and 150 non-PCOS women with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations <75 nmol/L in the trial. We randomized subjects to receive 20,000 IU of VD3/week (119 PCOS, 99 non-PCOS women) or placebo (61 PCOS, 51 non-PCOS women) for 24 weeks. Outcome measures were AMH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and androstenedione. In PCOS women, we observed a significant treatment effect on FSH (mean treatment effect 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.087 to 1.799, p = 0.031) and LH/FSH ratio (mean treatment effect -0.335, 95% CI -0.621 to 0.050, p = 0.022), whereas no significant effect was observed in non-PCOS women. In PCOS women, VD treatment for 24 weeks had a significant effect on FSH and LH/FSH ratio but no effect on AMH levels.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Objective: Exercise is recommended for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but the most effective exercise prescription is unclear. This trial compared effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), continuous aerobic exercise training (CAET) and no-exercise control on reproductive, anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes in PCOS. Design(s): Pilot randomized controlled trial. Participant(s): Previously inactive women aged 18-40 years with PCOS. Measurements: Feasibility outcomes included recruitment, retention, adherence to exercise and daily ovulation prediction kit (OPK) testing. Preliminary efficacy outcomes included reproductive, anthropometric and cardiometabolic health markers. Result(s): Forty-seven women were randomized to no-exercise control (n = 17), HIIT (n = 16), or CAET (n = 14). Forty (85%) participants completed the trial. Median exercise adherence was 68% (IQR 53%, 86%). Median daily OPK-testing adherence in the first half of the intervention was 87% (IQR 61%, 97%) compared with 65% (IQR 0%, 96%) in the second half. Body mass index decreased significantly in CAET compared with control (-1.0 kg/m2, p =.01) and HIIT (-0.9 kg/m2, p =.04). Mean waist circumference decreased in all groups (-7.3 cm, -6.9 cm, -4.5 cm in HIIT, CAET and control) with no significant between-group differences. Mean LDL-C was significantly reduced for HIIT compared to CAET (-0.33 mmol/L, p =.03). HDL-C increased in HIIT compared with control (0.18 mmol/L, p =.04). Conclusion(s): There were feasibility challenges with adherence to daily ovulation assessment limiting the ability to analyse the effect of the exercise interventions on ovulation. CAET and HIIT were both effective at improving anthropometrics and some cardiometabolic health markers. Further studies need to determine optimal and acceptable exercise prescriptions for this population.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Clinical Endocrinology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disease in women of childbearing age. It is characterized by excessive androgen production, ovulation disorders, and developing metabolic syndrome. The aim of the study was to check whether selected minerals were related to the pathophysiological mechanisms of PCOS. The concentrations of minerals were determined using an inductively coupled atomic plasma-emission spectrometer (ICP-AES Jobin Yvon JY-24). Blood samples from PCOS and control women were collected, processed, and digested with a microwave system in women with PCOS with and without insulin resistance and in the control group. It was found: zinc (Zn)-10.14 +/- 2.11, 9.89 +/- 1.44 and 10.30 +/- 1.67; nickel (Ni) 0.001 +/- 0.0009, 0.001 +/- 0.0006 and 0.002 +/- 0.00001; iron (Fe) 868.0 +/- 155.8, 835.3 +/- 156.4 and 833.0 +/- 94.6; manganese (Mn) 0.017 +/- 0.006, 0.017 +/- 0.008 and 0.020 +/- 0.009; copper (Cu) 0.714 +/- 0.129, 0.713 +/- 0.114 and 0.761 +/- 0.146; magnesium (Mg) 48.4 +/- 8.3, 50.0 +/- 8.4 and 45.3 +/- 10.7; sodium (Na) 374.3 +/- 84.3, 396.3 +/- 66.6 and 367.9 +/- 88.9; potassium (K) 2541.8 +/- 330.9, 2409.6 +/- 347.1 and 2336.9 +/- 211.4 (microg/g). Some micronutrient deficiencies may have a negative effect on the lipid profile in PCOS patients (Ni, Na). Further studies are needed to better understand dependencies.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Due to the endocrine disrupting effects of bisphenol A (BPA) several governmental authorities have banned its use and the manufacturers had to find alternative substances with similar chemical properties. This led to the increase in the use of so-called BPA analogues, which however also turn out to possess mild estrogenic and ani-androgenic properties and thus, may cause fertility problems and sex-hormone dependent endocrinopathies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential association between the exposure to BPA and its two analogues: BPS and BPF, with the diagnosis of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which remains the most common female endocrinopathy. Serum concentrations of BPA, BPS and BPF were measured using high performance liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) among 199 women with PCOS and 158 control subjects. In women with PCOS serum BPS concentrations were significantly higher compared to the control subjects (geometric mean [95% CI]: 0.14 ng/mL [0.10; 1.17] vs. 0.08 ng/mL [0.06; 0.09], P = 0.023). Serum BPA and BPF concentrations did not differ between the studied groups. There was however a negative correlation between serum BPA and HOMA-IR (r = - 0.233, P = 0.001) and TST (r = - 0.203, P = 0.006) in women with PCOS. No correlations were found between the serum BPs and other metabolic parameters such as serum lipids, insulin, DHEA-S, androstenedione and FAI. When studying the association between serum BPA analogues and PCOS it turned out that women whose serum BPS concentrations were in the first tertile were more likely to be diagnosed with this endocrinopathy (OR [95% CI]: 1.21 [1.04; 3.46], P = 0.017). This association was also statistically significant when adjusted for age, education, BMI, smoking, income, and alcohol consumption (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 1.12 [1.03; 3.71], P = 0.029). These results point to the potential association between the exposure to BPS and the diagnosis of PCOS. The role of BPA is not clear and warrants further studies. Serum BPS levels are higher in PCOS subjects compared to controls. Women with serum BPS levels in the lower tertile are more likely to be diagnosed with PCOS.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Background: A diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and its related phenotypic features including increased hair growth can affect a woman's social and emotional well-being. We aim to determine firstly, if excess body weight affects menstrual cycle length, excessive hair growth and other phenotypic features in healthy women without PCOS and secondly, whether having PCOS exacerbates the effects of high body mass index (BMI). Method(s): A prospective cross-sectional study involving healthy women (21-45 years) recruited at an annual health screen for hospital staff and volunteers from the university community, and PCOS cases referred to tertiary gynecological clinics in Singapore. To dissect the independent and/or combinatorial effects of PCOS and BMI on the phenotypic features, subjects were divided into four categories: non-PCOS (normal BMI), non-PCOS (high BMI), PCOS (normal BMI), and PCOS (high BMI). General linear modelling was performed to compare clinical, ovarian, hormonal and metabolic parameters across these four categories. Result(s): Of 389 participants, 134 (34.4%) were classified as PCOS and the remaining 255 (65.6%), as the non-PCOS population. Overall 45.2% of women had high BMI (>= 23). Compared to non-PCOS subjects, women with PCOS had a higher BMI (mean (SD): 25.14 +/- 6.46 vs 23.08 +/- 4.36, p < 0.001). Women with PCOS and high BMI had increased hair growth with modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) scores that were 2.96-fold higher versus healthy-normal BMI women (mean difference; 1.85, 95% CI 0.80-2.90). Compared to healthy-high BMI women, PCOS women with high BMI had significantly higher mean differences in mFG scores (1.79, 95% CI 0.64-2.93). In PCOS women, having high BMI also significantly increased mFG scores by 1.85-fold (mean difference; 1.82. 95% CI 0.52-3.12). This effect was mirrored by the additive effect of BMI and PCOS on free androgen index. No independent effect of high BMI on rates of oligomenorrhoea, antral follicle count, ovarian volume or serum androgens were observed. Conclusion(s): We observed an additive effect of body weight to increase hair growth in women with PCOS. Maximum mFG scores were present in PCOS women with high BMI. Such increases in mFG score may affect the self-esteem of women with PCOS.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an increasingly common problem for women in the reproductive age throughout the entire world. A reduction diet with a low glycaemic index (GI) has proved to support the treatment of PCOS. The aim of the study was to analyse the influence of the diet on the level of vitamins soluble in water. The study included 55 women, 40 of which suffered from PCOS (identified by means of the Rotterdam Criteria) and 15 healthy women of the Caucasian race. The level of vitamins before and after the dietary intervention was measured. The diet was a reduction diet with a reduced glycaemic index (GI). Biochemical analyses were made on the basis of liquid chromatography-Infinity 1260 Binary liquid chromatography (LC) Agilent Technology. The level of vitamins in the serum was analysed together with the consumption before and after the dietary intervention. A higher level of vitamin C in the plasma was observed before and after the dietary intervention in the PCOS group in comparison to the control group despite the lower intake of this vitamin in the PCOS group. The remaining vitamins were at a comparable or lower level (B1, B3, B5, B6 and B12). After the dietary intervention, only B1 and B9 were at a clearly lower level (a trend of p = 0.093 and p = 0.085). A properly balanced reduction diet with reduced GI improves the supply of vitamins in women with PCOS. An additional recommendation should be the additional supplementation of B1, niacinamide and the combination of folates with inositol. The level of vitamin C in the plasma may not be a good marker of its supply in the PCOS group.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex hormonal disorder which impairs ovarian function. The adherence to healthy dietary patterns and physical exercise are the first line of recommended treatment for PCOS patients, but it is yet unclear what type of diet is more adequate. In this case-control study, we explored associations between adherence to five dietary quality indices and the presence of PCOS. We enrolled 126 cases of PCOS and 159 controls living in Murcia (Spain). Diagnostic of PCOS and its phenotypes were established following the Rotterdam criteria (hyperandrogenism (H), oligoanovulation (O), polycystic ovaries morphology (POM)). We used a validated food frequency questionnaires to calculate the scores of five dietary indices: alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI), AHEI-2010, relative Mediterranean Dietary Score (rMED), alternate Mediterranean Dietary Score (aMED) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals. In the multivariable analysis, AHEI-2010 index was inversely associated with Hyperandrogenism + Oligoanovulation PCOS phenotype (ORQ3 vs.Q1 = 0.1; 95% CI: (0.0; 0.9); Pfor trend = 0.02). We did not find any statistical significant association between dietary indices and total anovulatory or ovulatory PCOS. However, further studies with higher sample sizes exploring these associations among the diverse phenotypes of PCOS are highly warranted.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to analyse the dietary habits identified by diet quality scores (DQS) in the scope of body fatness (BF) and nutritional knowledge (NK) of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women. DESIGN: Case-control study. The DQS were accessed by Dietary Habits, and Nutrition Beliefs Questionnaire (KomPAN, The Committee of Human Nutrition, Polish Academy of Science) included food frequency consumption of thirty-three food items and was formulated by six diet indexes: Pro-Healthy-Diet-Index (pHDI-10), Non-Healthy-Diet-Index (nHDI-14), High-Glycemic-Diet-Index-7 (hGIDI-7), Low-Glycemic-Diet-Index-4 (lGIDI-4), High-Sugar-Diet-Index-4 (hSDI-4) and High-Saturated-Fats-Diet-Index-8 (hSFDI-8). The BF was analysed by air displacement plethysmography (BodPod, Life Measurement Inc.). NK was assessed by using the twenty-five 'true or false' statements included in the KomPAN questionnaire. SETTING: Poland, Clinical Hospital, Department of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Internal Diseases. PARTICIPANTS: The study group included 122 PCOS women and 116 age- and socio-economic status-matched healthy controls (CON) aged 17-44 years. RESULT(S): Higher BF and lower NK in PCOS women v. controls were observed. PCOS women had a lower pHDI-10 and LGIDI-4 than CON. There was no relation between NK and DQS in PCOS women. The higher NK in the CON group was associated with increased intensity of pHDI-10 and lower frequency of hSFDI-8 levels. CONCLUSION(S): Pro-healthy DQS and NK of PCOS women in this study were lower than CON. Professional dietary education might improve dietary behaviours and understanding of the necessity of dietary habits modification in this group. A multidisciplinary approach is needed in the treatment of PCOS women.

N2  - The role of inappropriate lifestyle in the etiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and its metabolic and reproductive complications has attracted much attention in recent years; however, most studies involve adult patients. Thus, the study aimed to compare dietary patterns, physical activity, metabolic, anthropometric and inflammatory markers of 14-18-year-old girls with and without PCOS (n = 61 and n = 35, respectively) as well as to assess correlations between concentrations of metabolic and inflammatory markers and macronutrient intake and to identify the independent predictors of PCOS, related to diet and physical activity (PA). Compared to the control group, PCOS girls consumed significantly more total fat (p = 0.0005), including both saturated (SFA) (p = 0.03), monounsaturated (MUFA) (p = 0.0003) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (p = 0.01). A significantly higher percentage of PCOS patients consumed high and medium glycemic index (GI) foods (p = 0.03) and represented a low level of PA, both during school and in leisure time (41.67 vs. 6.06%; p = 0.0001 and 32.79 vs. 5.71%; p = 0.003, respectively). The PCOS group had also significantly higher waist circumference (WC), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.01), LDL cholesterol (p = 0.01), fasting insulin (p = 0.002) and HOMA-IR (p = 0.006) levels. There was an inverse correlation between fiber intake and fasting insulin, (p = 0.0002, r = -0.37), HOMA-IR (p = 0.0004, r = -0.35), WC (p = 0.029; r = -0.222) and a positive relationship between high and medium GI diet and insulin concentration (p = 0.003; r = 0.3). An increase of 10 g/day in total fat intake per day increases the probability of PCOS by 1.4 times. If the SFA or MUFA intakes increase by 10 g, the probability of PCOS increase 1.7-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively. The consumption of foods with a medium GI raises the probability of PCOS by more than 3 times, after adjusting for age. The odds ratio decreased for the moderate and high PA at school/work and in leisure time. Further research in girls with PCOS is needed to test whether low GI and dietary fatty acid reduction combined with increased PA is effective in the nonpharmacological treatment and prevention of PCOS complications.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome predisposes alterations which contribute to the reduction of quality of life. This randomized controlled clinical trial study was to evaluate the effect of two protocols of aerobic exercise on quality of life in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Women were allocated to three groups: continuous aerobic training (n=28), intermittent aerobic training (n=29), and control group (no training; n=30). Testosterone levels, body composition indices, and quality of life were assessed at baseline and after 16weeks of intervention. Both protocols were effective to improve testosterone levels, anthropometric indices, and quality of life in polycystic ovary syndrome women. Thus, these protocols should be included in the clinical environment to improve clinical parameters psychological, biological and social health to this population.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reason of anovulatory infertility. Environmental factor is one of the main causes of PCOS, but its contribution to ovulatory dysfunction in PCOS remains unknown. Method(s): A total of 2217 infertile women diagnosed as PCOS according to Rotterdam criteria were recruited, including 1979 women with oligo-Anovulation (OA group) and 238 women with normal-Anovulation (non OA group). Besides, 279 healthy control women of reproductive age were enrolled as controls. Result(s): Frequencies of snoring (PCOS-OA group, PCOS-non-OA group, control group: 29.30% vs 18.10% vs 11.50%, P < 0.01), smoking (37.70% vs 28.10% vs 12.20%, P < 0.01), plastic tableware usage (38.30% vs 28.10% vs 25.40%, P < 0.01) and indoor decoration (32.10% vs 24.80% vs 16.80%, P < 0.01) were highest in PCOS-OA group. After adjusted for multivariable, difference remained significant between PCOS-OA group and the other two groups. PCOS-OA women preferred a meat favorable diet compared to PCOS-non-OA group (54.60% vs 41.30%, P < 0.01). There was no difference between three groups in exercise, frequency of insomnia, and alcohol consumption. Conclusion(s): Smoking, snoring, hyper-caloric diet, plastic tableware usage and indoor decoration were found to be associated with an increased risk for ovulatory dysfunction in women suffering from PCOS.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Objective: Obesity is a key contributor to metabolic and reproductive outcomes in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The role of the dietary glycemic index (GI) and load (GL), and adiposity has been debated and studies on PCOS are scarce. We aimed to compare the dietary GI and GL and several anthropometric measurements in PCOS and control women. The association between dietary GI and GL and adiposity indices was examined in this cross-sectional study. Methods and materials: A study population consisted of 65 previously diagnosed with PCOS and 65 healthy women. All participants underwent detailed anthropometric, dietary and physical activity evaluation and categorized based on GI and GL tertiles. Result(s): When dietary GL was adjusted for age, physical activity level (PAL), and duration of diagnosis, there was a statistically significant inverse association between dietary GL and waist/hip ratio (WHR) (OR: 0.136; 95% CI: 0.021-0.874; p = 0.036) in women with PCOS. Both dietary GI (OR: 8.869; 95% CI: 1.194-65.910; p = 0.033 for tertile 2 in adjustment model) and GL (OR: 7.200; 95% CI: 1.635-31.712; p = 0.009 for tertile 3 in crude model; OR: 5.801; 95% CI: 1.242-27.096; p = 0.025 for tertile 3 in adjustment model) positively associated with WHR in healthy subjects. Also, positive association was observed between dietary GI and waist/height ratio (WHtR) (OR: 0.229; 95% CI: 0.063-0.826; p = 0.024 for tertile 2; OR: 0.277; 95% CI: 0.078-0.988; p = 0.048 for tertile 3) in healthy controls, however after adjustment for age and PAL, statistical significance was lost (OR: 1.051; 95% CI: 0.152-7.261; p = 0.959 for tertile 2; OR: 1.522; 95% CI: 0.225-10.297; p = 0.667 for tertile 3). Conclusion(s): The results of this study consistent with the literature that PCOS is associated with increased adiposity indices. There was no association between dietary GI/GL and BMI, WC, WHtR, and ABSI but dietary GL was inversely associated WHR in PCOS patients.Copyright © 2019 American College of Nutrition.

N2  - Objectives: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common metabolic and endocrine abnormality in reproductive-aged women. The aim of this study was to investigate the relevance between major dietary patterns and PCOS. Method(s): This was a case-control study with 108 women newly diagnosed with PCOS and 108 age-, and body mass index-matched women without PCOS, as a control group, in Yazd, Iran. PCOS was diagnosed based on Rotterdam criteria. Subsequently, the validated 168-item food frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate the usual dietary intake. Moreover, principal component analysis was used for driving dietary patterns, and logistic regression assessed the relationship between dietary patterns and PCOS. Result(s): Three major dietary patterns were identified: a high glycemic index (GI; high fat), a low GI (low fat), and an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern. After adjustment for potential confounders, the high GI (high fat) dietary pattern significantly increased the odds for PCOS (odds ratio [OR] for the highest and. lowest quartile, 3.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-9.38), and demonstrated a significant increase in BMI, waist circumference, fasting blood sugar, and visceral fat. Having adjusted the potential confounders, the moderate adherence to the anti-inflammatory dietary pattern had a protective effect on the odds of PCOS (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15-0.95). However, no significant relation was found between the low GI (low fat) dietary pattern and the odds of PCOS. Conclusion(s): The results indicated that the high-GI (high-fat) dietary pattern had an incremental effect on the odds of PCOS. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory dietary pattern had a reduction effect on the risk for PCOS. It's worth noting that more prospective studies are required to confirm the findings of this study.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effects of continuous (CA) and intermittent (IA) aerobic training on hormonal and metabolic parameters and body composition of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Prospective, interventional, randomized study. Method(s): Randomized controlled training (RCT) with sample allocation and stratification into three groups: CAT (n = 28) and IAT (n = 29) training and no training [control (CG), n = 30]. Before and after 16 weeks of intervention (CAT or IAT) or observation (CG), hormonal and metabolic parameters, body composition and anthropometric indices were evaluated. Aerobic physical training on a treadmill consisted of 30- to 50-minute sessions with intensities ranging from 60% to 90% of the maximum heart rate. Result(s): In the CA group, there was reduction in waist circumference (WC) (P =.045), hip circumference (P =.032), cholesterol (P <=.001), low-density lipoprotein (P =.030) and testosterone (P <=.001). In the IAT group, there was a reduction in WC (P =.014), waist-to-hip ratio (P =.012), testosterone (P =.019) and the free androgen index (FAI) (P =.037). The CG showed increases in WC (P =.049), total body mass (P =.015), body fat percentage (P =.034), total mass of the arms (P <=.001), trunk fat percentage (P =.033), leg fat percentage (P =.021) and total gynoid mass (P =.011). Conclusion(s): CAT and IAT training reduced anthropometric indices and hyperandrogenism in PCOS, whereas only IAT training reduced the FAI. Furthermore, only CAT training improved the lipid profile.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Objective: Effects of lifestyle modification on reproductive function in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remain poorly elucidated. We compared the effects of a pulse-based diet (lentils, beans, split peas and chickpeas) with Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet on ultrasonographic markers of ovarian morphology, hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularity in PCOS. Design(s): Randomized controlled trial. Patient(s): Women with PCOS (18-35 years). Measurements: Thirty women randomized to the pulse-based and 31 to TLC groups completed a 16-week intervention without energy restriction. Groups performed aerobic exercise (minimum of 5 days/wk; 45 minutes/d) and received health counselling (monthly) and longitudinal follow-up. Follicle numbers per ovary (FNPO, 2-9 mm), ovarian volume (OV), free androgen index (FAI) and menstrual cycle length were measured pre- and postintervention. Result(s): Follicle numbers per ovary (mean change +/- SD, -10 +/- 15), OV (-2.7 +/- 4.8 mL), FAI (-3 +/- 2) and menstrual cycle length (-13 +/- 47 days) decreased over time in both groups (All: P <.01), without group-by-time interactions (All: P >=.13). Attrition rate was 33.7% and comparable between groups (P =.94). Adherence to diet intervention negatively correlated with changes in FNPO (r=-0.54), OV (r=-0.35) and FAI (r = -.29) in pooled groups (All: P <=.04). Groups maintained reduced OV, FNPO, FAI and menstrual cycles 6 months postintervention; however, decreased FNPO and FAI at 16 weeks tended to revert to baseline levels 12 months postintervention in both groups (All: P <=.05). Conclusion(s): Both interventions improved ovarian dysmorphology, hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularity in PCOS, and no diet appeared to be superior at improving reproductive outcomes. Our observations highlight the importance of longitudinal surveillance for sustainable adherence to newly adopted healthy lifestyle behaviours and reproductive health in PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01288638).Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Objective: A favorable dietary composition to increase health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in PCOS remains unclear. We compared changes in HRQoL of women with PCOS who participated in a low-glycemic-index pulse-based (lentils, beans, split peas, and chickpeas) or the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet intervention. Method(s): Thirty women in the pulse-based and 31 in the TLC groups (18-35 years) completed a 16-week intervention without energy-restriction. Groups participated in health counseling (monthly) and aerobic exercise (5 days/week; 45 minutes/day). Result(s): Fifty-five (90.2%) women completed a PCOS-specific HRQoL survey. Greatest mean increases in time-effects occurred in the domains of healthy eating, PCOS knowledge, active living, healthcare satisfaction, feelings and experiences about intervention, and health concerns, respectively (p <= 0.02), without group-by-time interactions (p >= 0.13). Decreased weight (r = -0.35) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (r = -0.18) correlated with increased scores of PCOS knowledge; adherence to intervention correlated with increased scores of active living (r = 0.39) and healthy eating (r = 0.53; p <= 0.03). Conclusion(s): Both interventions improved HRQoL scores in women with PCOS without prescribed energy-restriction. Our observations add novel insights into current evidence and elucidate the need for future psychological research to target lifestyle modifications for improving HRQoL and unique psychological complications of PCOS in this high-risk population (CinicalTrials.gov identifier:NCT01288638).Copyright © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, with clinical symptoms including menstrual dysfunction and hyperandrogenemia, as well as insulin resistance which is thought to be a key contributing factor to symptoms. Insulin is also thought to positively affect bone while oligo- and amenorrhea are known to negatively affect bone. Lifestyle modification is the first recommendation to treat symptoms of PCOS; however, little is known about the effect of lifestyle interventions on bone measures in this population. Pulses (e.g., chickpeas, beans, split peas, lentils) have been shown to lower fasting insulin, and the objective of this study was to determine the effect of a pulse-based diet compared to the therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) diet on bone measures and body composition in women with PCOS. Women aged 18-35 years with PCOS were randomized to either a pulse-based diet or the TLC diet for 16-weeks while following an aerobic exercise program. Thirty-one in the TLC group and 29 in the pulse group completed dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry analysis following the intervention. After 16-weeks, both groups had a lower BMI, whole body fat mass, and % fat (p < 0.005), with no difference in lean mass. In both groups, lumbar spine bone mineral content (BMC) and density were higher following the intervention (p < 0.05) while femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) was lower (p < 0.05). Intertrochanteric section modulus improved in both groups while there was a group x time interaction in femoral shaft subperiosteal width which was more favorable in the pulse group (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that the femoral neck may be compromised during a lifestyle intervention in women with PCOS. Research is warranted to preserve bone health during lifestyle change in women with PCOS.Copyright © 2020 University of Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan, Canada

N2  - Background: Both physical and mental health care for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) require a multidisciplinary approach. We evaluated the effects of continuous (CAT) and intermittent (IAT) aerobic training in different protocols that measure body image, anxiety, depression and sexual dysfunction in women with PCOS. Method(s): In this controlled clinical trial, women with PCOS were randomly allocated for 16 weeks to 1 out of 3 groups: CAT (n = 28), IAT (n = 29), or control group (CG, n = 30). For data collection, we used the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ), Figure Rating Scale (FRS), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Measurement Scales (HADS). Result(s): No effects of CAT, IAT or CG groups were identified in the perceptual dimension of body image. The dis(satisfaction) grade improved after exercise in the CAT group (p <= 0.01) compared to the CG, as well as improved within CAT and IAT groups. Total FSFI, and HADS-A and HADS-D scores improved after exercise in the both groups. At baseline and after the study period, there were positive correlations between scores for dis(satisfaction), HADS-A and HADS-D scores. HADS-A and HADS-D scores had a negative correlation with FSFI total in the IAT (p = =0.02) group compared to the CG, as well as within CAT and IAT groups. Limitation(s): The participants were not matched for body mass index (normal, overweight and obese) which may interfere on body image dimensions. Conclusion(s): Aerobic exercise improves sexual function and indices related to anxiety and depression. Likewise, it interferes in cognitive-affective dimension of the body image.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to compare dietary intake and lifestyle behaviour in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and healthy women. METHOD(S): One hundred and sixty healthy women (partner with male infertility) were recruited to a control group; 168 women with PCOS (diagnosed on ultrasound) were recruited to a case study group for this cross-sectional comparative study. The case group was classified into three phenotypes based on the presence or absence of menstrual disorder (M), hyperandrogenism (HA) and polycystic ovary according to sonography (PCO): HA+PCO (n = 53), PCO+M (n = 57) and M+HA+PCO (n = 66). Dietary intake and lifestyle behaviour were measured using a food frequency questionnaire and a lifestyle questionnaire. RESULT(S): The mean energy (P < 0.001) and fat (P < 0.001) intakes were greater in PCOS groups compared to the control group. The average energy and fat intakes were greater in HA+M+PCO group after age and body mass index (BMI) adjustment compared to the other phenotypes (P < 0.001). In comparison with the control group, lifestyle scores were lower in the PCOS group in the fields of physical activity, weight and nutrition control after age and BMI adjustment (P < 0.001). The average score of lifestyle in the fields of physical activity, weight and nutrition control, and psychological health was lower in the phenotype HA+M+PCO compared to the other phenotypes (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): A limited energy and fat intake is strongly recommended in Iranian women with PCOS, especially for phenotype HA+M+PCO. Consultation with respect to improvement of psychological health and the importance of weight and nutrition control, as well as appropriate physical activity, is advocated, especially in patients with phenotype HA+M+PCO.Copyright © 2019 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study is to assess differences in body composition between female participants in the study group who suffer from PCOS versus a healthy control group. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 85, 14-22-year-old, female participants. Participants belonged to one of two groups. Thirty seven participants with a diagnosis of PCOS were in the clinical group, and 48 participants were in the healthy control group with no prior diagnosis of PCOS. RESULT(S): A statistically significant difference between groups was found in their answer regarding diet. A correlation was found between the body fat index and the use of dieting among participants; participants with a lower body fat index (in kilograms) were less likely to be on a diet. CONCLUSION(S): The young female participants with PCOS were shown to have similar body composition to age-matched healthy controls. However, the clinical group with PCOS reported more frequent use of dieting, with less use of exercise.

N2  - AIM: The first-line therapy for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is weight loss focussing on diet and regular exercise; measurement of diet and energy intake (EI) is important to determine associations between nutrients and health in women with PCOS. The EI underreporting (UR) is a condition characterised by reports of habitual EI that is implausibly low, compared with estimated requirements. This case-control study aims to evaluate UR in women with PCOS. METHOD(S): Thirty-six women with PCOS were enrolled according to the Rotterdam criteria; 37 healthy women were enrolled as controls. INCLUSION CRITERIA: age range 18-45 and body mass index >=18.5 kg/m2 in subjects without eating disorders and/or diabetes mellitus. Nutritional assessment included: anthropometry, basal metabolic rate (BMR), weight history and physical activity assessment. Subjects completed a non-consecutive three-day dietary diary to identify energy and macronutrient intake. UR was calculated (Goldberg Index: EI/BMR). RESULT(S): Although women with PCOS reported a significantly higher mean BMR than controls (P<0.0001), their EI was lower (P<0.001), suggesting an UR in 47.2% of women with PCOS versus 2.7% of controls (P<0.0001). The EI from simple sugars was lower in women with PCOS than controls (P<0.01). The protein intake was increased in controls than women with PCOS (P<0.0001). Weight cycling was more frequent in women with PCOS (P<0.001). Logistic regression analysis identified UR associated with PCOS (P=0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Women with PCOS underreport foods rich in simple sugars rather than underreport their total dietary intake. These results may have implications for the interpretation of diet and health correlations in this patient population.Copyright © 2018 Dietitians Association of Australia.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multifactorial endocrine disorder in women. Change in lifestyle, especially dietary pattern, might have a role in the prevalence of PCOS. The limited number of studies has made it difficult to draw any conclusion about the relationship of dietary patterns with PCOS. This study aimed to investigate the association between dietary patterns and PCOS. A case-control study was performed on 225 patients newly diagnosed with PCOS and 345 healthy women in Isfahan, Iran. The presence of PCOS was confirmed by expert gynecologists based on Rotterdam criteria. Usual dietary intake was assessed by a 168-item food frequency questionnaire. Dietary patterns were identified by principal component analysis. Three major dietary patterns including Western, plant-based, and mixed were identified that explained 53.93% of the variance in food intake. The top tertile of the Western dietary pattern significantly increased the odds of PCOS (odds ratio (OR), 2.03; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-3.67), both before and after adjustments for covariates. After adjustments for potential confounders, the highest tertile of the plant-based dietary pattern was related to higher odds of PCOS than the lowest tertile (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.23-4.37). In addition, those in the second tertile of the mixed dietary pattern were 66% less likely to have PCOS compared with those in the lowest tertile (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18-0.61). In conclusion, we found that Western and plant-based dietary patterns were associated with an increased risk of PCOS. Also, moderate adherence to the mixed dietary pattern was associated with a reduced risk of PCOS. Additional studies with a longitudinal design are required to confirm our findings.

N2  - Background & aims: Overweight polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients present exacerbation of clinical symptoms and increased risk for chronic diseases. The effects of inadequate dietary intake have been investigated in body weight gain in PCOS women. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dietary pattern and to analyze possible associations with the metabolism and body composition in PCOS women. Method(s): A case-control study was performed with thirty-nine women diagnosed with PCOS and thirty-five control women, matched by age and body mass index. A body composition assessment was performed by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and food intake was assessed using the seven-day food record. The metabolic parameters evaluated were fasting glucose, insulin, Homeostasis Model Assessment-estimated Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Result(s): No significant differences were observed in dietary intake of women with or without PCOS. In the analysis of the associations between dietary intake, metabolic parameters and body composition, PCOS women showed an inverse correlation between dietetic fiber intake and HOMA-IR index (r = -0.365; p = 0.024). Also in PCOS group, dietary fiber intake presented an inverse correlation with total body fat (r = -0.401; p = 0.011), trunk fat (r = -0.388; p = 0.015), and android fat (r = -0.431; p = 0.006). PCOS women group had higher glucose 120', compared to those without PCOS (p = 0.015). Conclusion(s): These results provide evidence that the adequate intake of dietary fiber contributes to more appropriate body composition and glucose metabolism in PCOS women and possibly toward the prevention of chronic non-communicable diseases.Copyright © 2018

N2  - Objective: the present study evaluates energy intake, macronutrient composition and dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and age and body mass index (BMI)- matched controls, and relationship between carbohydrate variables with inflammatory markers. Method(s): This case-control study was conducted on 90 women aged 18-35 years including 45 women with PCOS and 45 age and BMI-matched healthy controls. Dietary intakes, GI and GL were assessed using three 24-hour recalls. Biochemical profile including high-sensivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) as inflammatory markers and also metabolic variables related to insulin resistance were measured. Anthropometric measurements were performed in all subjects. Result(s): Dietary GI and starch intake were significantly higher in PCOS group compared with age and BMI-matched control group (P < 0.05). Fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and hs-CRP were higher in patients compared with controls (P < 0.05). No significant correlation was detected between biochemical variables and macronutrient intakes. Conclusion(s): Total energy and macronutrient intakes were similar between the groups except for dietary GI and starch intake. However, quality and quantity of carbohydrate consumed was not associated with insulin resistance and inflammatory markers in the PCOS group.Copyright © Mattioli 1885.

N2  - Lifestyle modifications are recommended as first-line therapy in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, usual dietary and physical activity (PA) behaviors of women with PCOS remain uncertain, likely owing to controversy in diagnostic criteria. Our objective was to contrast the usual dietary and PA behaviors of women with PCOS (n = 80) diagnosed by the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS to that of controls (n = 44). Study outcomes were dietary intake, diet quality (Healthy Eating Index-2015), and PA (questionnaire, waist-worn accelerometers). Women with PCOS met the acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges for carbohydrate, fat, and protein, but did not meet the recommended dietary reference intakes for vitamin D (mean (95% confidence interval); 6 (5-7) microg/d), vitamin B9 (275 (252-298) microg/d), total fiber (24 (22-26) g/d), or sodium (4.0 (3.6-4.4) g/d). Women with PCOS also met the US recommendations for PA. No differences were detected in dietary intake, diet quality, or PA levels between groups (p >= 0.11). In conclusion, women with and without PCOS have comparable dietary and PA behaviors. A lack of unique targets for dietary or PA interventions supports the position of the new guideline to foster healthy lifestyle recommendations for the management of PCOS.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common female endocrine disorder and is characterized by chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. Obesity, low-grade chronic inflammatory status, and insulin-resistance (IR) often coexist in PCOS. The Mediterranean diet (MD) is an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern, which is rich in complex carbohydrates and fiber, and high in monounsaturated fat. There is a close association among obesity, low-grade chronic inflammation, IR, and hormonal derangements in PCOS. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the adherence to MD, the dietary intake, and the body composition and their association with PCOS clinical severity in a cohort of treatment-naive women with PCOS when compared with a control group of healthy women matched for age and body mass index (BMI). In this case-controlled, cross-sectional study, we enrolled 112 patients with PCOS and 112 controls. PREvencion con DIetaMEDiterranea (PREDIMED) and seven-day food records were used to evaluate the degree of adherence to the MD and dietary pattern, respectively. Body composition was evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) phase-sensitive system. Testosterone levels and Ferriman-Gallwey score assessed the clinical severity of PCOS. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined with a nephelometric assay with CardioPhase high sensitivity. PCOS women showed higher testosterone levels, Ferriman-Gallwey score, fasting insulin and glucose levels, and Homeostatic Model Assessment (HoMA)-IR when compared with the control group (p < 0.001). In addition, we found that the PCOS women consumed less extra-virgin olive oil, legumes, fish/seafood, and nuts compared with control group. Despite no differences in energy intake between the two groups, the PCOS women consumed a lower quantity of complex carbohydrate, fiber, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and higher quantity of simple carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fatty acid (SFA), PUFA and n-6 PUFA than the control group. The PCOS women have an adverse body composition when compared with controls, with the lowest values of phase angle (PhA) and fat-free mass (p < 0.001). Additionally, after adjusting for BMI and total energy intake, testosterone levels showed significant negative correlations with PREDIMED score (p < 0.001) and consumption of protein (p = 0.005), complex carbohydrate (p < 0.001), fiber (p < 0.001), MUFA (p < 0.001), n-3 PUFA (p = 0.001), and positive associations with CRP levels, simple carbohydrate, SFA, n-6 PUFA (p < 0.001, respectively), and PUFA (p = 0.002). The cut-off for PREDIMED score <= 6 (p < 0.001, area under the curve (AUC) 0.848, standard error 0.036, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.768 to 0.909) could serve as a threshold for significantly increased risk of high value of testosterone levels. In conclusion, a novel direct association between the adherence to MD and the clinical severity of the disease was reported in women with PCOS. This association could support a therapeutic role of foods and nutrients of the Mediterranean dietary pattern in the PCOS pathogenesis likely involving their inflammatory status, IR, and hyperandrogenemia. In addition, we reported a different body composition that is characterized by lower PhA and fat-free mass than controls. These data suggested a role of PhA as a useful marker of the clinical severity of this syndrome and provided strong evidence regarding the strategic relevance of the nutritional assessment in the management of women with PCOS.Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may face additional barriers in achieving weight loss. We aimed to compare the effects of the hypocaloric low glycemic index (LGI) diet on anthropometric variables and insulin resistance in women with and without PCOS and investigate the effect of this diet on the clinical and hormonal features of PCOS women. Method(s): This interventional study was carried out at the Reproductive Endocrinology Research Center, Research Institute for Endocrine Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Of 108 women invited for the purpose of the present study, 62 participants (PCOS = 28, non-PCOS = 34) followed a 24-week energy restricted LGI diet. Anthropometric, biochemical, hormonal and clinical measurements were documented at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks with intervention. Result(s): The percentages of weight loss achieved by both the PCOS and non-PCOS groups did not differ significantly (PCOS:-8.04% vs. non-PCOS:-8.09%). No significant difference in decrease of homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was observed between the two groups (PCOS =-0.83 +/- 0.33, non PCOS =-0.79 +/- 0.28, P = 0.83). In PCOS women, significant reduction in total testosterone (-0.91 +/- 0.33 nmol/L, P = 0.006), FAI (-4.47 +/- 1.1, P < 0.001) and increase in SHBG (38.98 +/- 11.02 nmol/L, P < 0.001) were observed. Menstrual irregularity was improved in 80% of women with PCOS and a significant decrease (32.1%) in occurrence of acne was reported. Conclusion(s): This diet has equally beneficial effects on anthropometric and metabolic characteristics of overweight women with and without PCOS. Trial registration: This study is registered in the Iranian Randomized Clinical Trials Registry (IRCT, code: IRCT2016092129909N1).Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Lifestyle intervention is first line treatment in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The effect of motivational interviewing (MI) as add on to standard advice (SA) on weight loss and quality of life (QoL) has not been evaluated in obese women with PCOS. We aimed to examine whether MI as add on to SA induced higher weight loss and improved QoL in obese women with PCOS. Thirty-seven obese women with PCOS (BMI >=30 kg/m2) were randomized to MI + SA (n = 19) vs. SA (n = 18) for six months. Anthropometric measures (BMI, waist) and questionnaires (World Health Organization-5 (WHO-5), Major Depression Index (MDI), Short Form-36 (SF-36) and PCOS-Questionnaire (PCOS-Q)) were performed at baseline and at follow-up, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02924025. Twenty-eight (14 + 14) women completed the study. At baseline, 24/28 women had WHO-5 scores <67 and 12/28 women had MDI scores indicating depression. Changes in weight and QoL were similar between MI + SA vs. SA group. However, WHO-5 (p=.028) and MDI (p=.008) scores improved significantly in the 12/24 women with MDI scores indicating depression. MI as add on to SA did not improve QoL or weight loss. Obese women with PCOS had low QoL.Copyright © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Objective: Lifestyle intervention is the recommended first-line treatment for overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, the efficacy of lifestyle change in improving reproductive function is still unclear. Design(s): A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with allocation to a behavioural modification programme (intervention) or minimal intervention (control) for 4 months with a follow-up at 12 months. Patient(s): Sixty-eight women, aged 18-40 years, body mass index (BMI) >= 27 kg/m2, fulfilling all Rotterdam PCOS criteria were randomized to treatment. Measurements: The primary outcome was improved menstrual regularity. Secondary outcomes were ovulation and pregnancy rates. Result(s): At 4 months, the weight loss was significant in the intervention group (-2.1%, P = 0.002) and nonsignificant in the control group (-1.0%). A higher proportion of patients in the intervention group improved menstrual regularity compared to the control group, mean difference 35% (95% CI: 16-60), P = 0.003. There was no difference in ovulation rate between groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that intervention was the only predictor of improved menstrual function, OR 3.9 (95% CI: 1.3-11.9). At 12 months, a total of 54% of the women improved menstrual regularity compared to baseline (P = 0.000) and 43% (P = 0.000) had confirmed ovulation. 38% of the women wishing to become pregnant succeeded within 1 year of study completion. Conclusion(s): This is the first RCT in overweight women with PCOS showing efficacy in improving reproductive function following behavioural modification intervention in comparison with minimal intervention. Although extensive weight loss is difficult to achieve in these women, behavioural modification intervention can help improve reproductive function.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition characterized by hyperandrogenism, anthropometric changes (increased weight and waist-to-hip ratio [WHR]), behavioral changes (sexual dysfunction, anxiety, and depression), and reduced quality of life. Physical exercise may reduce many of the adverse effects of PCOS. However, no studies have yet evaluated the effects of aerobic exercise on the sexual function of women with PCOS. Aim(s): To compare the effects of continuous and intermittent aerobic physical training on the sexual function and mood of women with PCOS. Method(s): This is a secondary analysis of a controlled clinical trial in which women with PCOS (18-39 years of age) were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups for 16 weeks: continuous aerobic training (CAT, n = 23), intermittent aerobic training (IAT, n = 22), or no training (control group, n = 24). The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was used to assess sexual function, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxiety and depression. Main Outcome Measure(s): The main outcome measure used was the FSFI. Outcome(s): The primary outcomes were changes from baseline in total FSFI score and HAD scores at week 16 to prove the superiority of intermittent aerobic exercise compared with continuous aerobic exercise. Result(s): After 16 weeks, the CAT group had a significant increase in the total FSFI score, improvements in the FSFI domains of satisfaction and pain, and a reduction in the WHR. The CAT and IAT groups also had significantly lower levels of testosterone after 16 weeks. The IAT group had a significant increase in the total FSFI score and improvements in the desire, excitation, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction FSFI domains. The CAT and IAT groups both had significant reductions in anxiety and depression scores after 16 weeks. Clinical Implications: Aerobic physical training protocols could be indicated to promote mental and sexual health in women with PCOS. Strength & Limitations: This is one of the first studies to examine the effects of different physical training protocols on the sexual function of women with PCOS. The limitations of this study are that we did not consider diet or the frequency of sexual relations of participants with their partners. These factors could have interfered with the outcomes. Conclusion(s): The CAT and IAT protocols improved the sexual function and reduced the anxiety and depression of women with PCOS. Both protocols were similar to improve FSFI domain scores.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of a supervised aerobic exercise training intervention on health-related quality of life (HRQL), cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiometabolic profile, and affective response in overweight/obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHOD(S): Twenty-seven overweight/obese inactive women with PCOS (body mass index, >= 25 kg.m; age 18 to 34 yr) were allocated into an exercise group (n = 14) and a control group (n = 13). Progressive aerobic exercise training was performed three times per week (~150 min.wk) over 16 wk. Cardiorespiratory fitness, HRQL, and cardiometabolic profile were evaluated before and after the intervention. Affective response (i.e., feeling of pleasure/displeasure) was evaluated during the exercise sessions. RESULT(S): The exercise group improved 21% +/- 12% of cardiorespiratory fitness (P < 0.001) and HRQL in the following domains: physical functioning, general health, and mental health (P < 0.05). Moreover, the exercise group decreased body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol level (P < 0.05). The affective response varied from "good" to "fairly good" (i.e., positive affective response) in an exercise intensity-dependent manner during the exercise training sessions. CONCLUSION(S): Progressive aerobic exercise training improved HRQL, cardiorespiratory fitness, and cardiometabolic profile of overweight/obese women with PCOS. Moreover, the participants reported the exercise training sessions as pleasant over the intervention. These results reinforce the importance of supervised exercise training as a therapeutic approach for overweight/obese women with PCOS.

N2  - Background/Aims: There is a heightened risk for cardiovascular diseases in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Alterations in heart rate variability (HRV) may reflect subclinical cardiovascular disease, with a putative association between HRV and dietary fat. This study evaluated HRV in PCOS and control women based on the dietary intake of saturated fatty acid (SFA). Method(s): Biochemical/hormonal profile, resting metabolic rate, physical activity, HRV in response to the Stroop test, and dietary intake were assessed in 84 PCOS and 54 control women stratified by median SFA intake in the PCOS group (8.5% of daily energy intake). Result(s): Body mass index (p = 0.041), blood pressure (p < 0.01), and HOMA-IR (p = 0.003) were higher in PCOS vs. controls. PCOS women had higher testosterone (p = 0.001), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (p = 0.012), and free androgen index (p = 0.001), and lower sex hormone-binding globulin levels than controls (p = 0.001). In both groups, the clinical profile and calorie intake were similar between SFA categories. In PCOS, testosterone was lower when SFA intake <8.5%. PCOS women with SFA <8.5% consumed more beans, fruits, and vegetables and had better frequency and time domain HRV indices. No differences in HRV were detected between SFA categories in controls. In PCOS, age and SFA intake were independent predictors of HRV. Conclusion(s): Lower SFA intake is related to improved cardiovascular autonomic function in PCOS.Copyright © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - We compared the effects of a low-glycemic index pulse-based diet, containing lentils, beans, split peas, and chickpeas, to the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet on cardio-metabolic measures in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Ninety-five women (18-35 years) enrolled in a 16-week intervention; 30 women in the pulse-based and 31 in the TLC groups completed the study. Women participated in aerobic exercise training (minimum 5 days/week for 45 min/day) and were counselled (monthly) about PCOS and lifestyle modification. Women underwent longitudinal follow-up post-intervention. The pulse-based group had a greater reduction in total area under the curve for insulin response to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (mean change +/- SD: -121.0 +/- 229.9 vs. -27.4 +/- 110.2 microIU/mL x min; p = 0.05); diastolic blood pressure (-3.6 +/- 6.7 vs. -0.2 +/- 6.7 mmHg, p = 0.05); triglyceride (-0.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 0.0 +/- 0.5 mmol/L, p = 0.04); low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.2 +/- 0.4 vs. -0.1 +/- 0.4 mmol/L, p = 0.05); total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C; -0.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 0.1 +/- 0.4, p < 0.001); and a greater increase in HDL-C (0.1 +/- 0.2 vs. -0.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/L, p < 0.01) than the TLC group. Decreased TC/HDL-C (p = 0.02) at six-month and increased HDL-C and decreased TC/HDL-C (p <= 0.02) at 12-month post-intervention were maintained in the pulse-based group. A pulse-based diet may be more effective than the TLC diet at improving cardio-metabolic disease risk factors in women with PCOS.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effects of recent and previous exercise and dietary habits on the occurrence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): The present study had a population-based case-control phase and a nested case-control phase. Women aged 12-44 years with and without PCOS were surveyed using the Semiquantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire to evaluate the correlation of PCOS with recent (last 7 days) or previous (5 years ago) exercise and dietary habits. Result(s): No difference in recent physical activity was found between the PCOS and control groups (case-control phase, n=1854). However, patients with PCOS had previously (5 years ago; nested case-control phase, n=1149) spent less time physical active in relation to transportation (P=0.003), housekeeping (P=0.023), walking (P<0.001), and activities of moderate intensity (P=0.008), and had spent more time sitting (P<0.001). Dietary nutrients and energy intake did not differ between the two groups (P>0.05 for all comparisons). Conclusion(s): Previous exercise habits were associated with subsequent PCOS whereas a recently acquired exercise routine was not. Women should avoid long-term sedentary lifestyle habits and focus on adding to the duration of, or enhancing the intensity of, physical activity.Copyright © 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics

N2  - Objective To study the incidence rate and hazard ratios of diabetes and prediabetes between women with PCOS and healthy subjects. Design Prospective population-based study. Setting Not applicable. Patient(s) Women with PCOS (n = 178) and eumenorrheic, nonhirsute, healthy women as controls (n = 1,524), all followed for a median time of 12.9 years. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Incidence rate and hazard ratios of diabetes and prediabetes between women with PCOS and healthy controls. Result(s) We analyzed the participants on two pathways. First, for detecting new diabetes mellitus (DM) events, we selected participants who were free of DM at baseline (n = 39). Second, for detecting new pre-DM events, we selected participants who were free of pre-DM and DM at baseline (n = 222) from the baseline population. The rest of the population were included for final analysis to calculate the incidence rates and hazard ratio of diabetes and prediabetes events. The incidence rates of diabetes were 12.9 and 4.9 per 1,000 person-years for PCOS and controls, respectively. This incidence rate in women younger than 40 with and without PCOS was 13.4 and 4.2, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for women <=40 was 4.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-9.3). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups studied after age 40. The incidence rates of prediabetes were 29.7 and 25.9 per 1,000 person-years for PCOS and healthy women, respectively. The incidence rate in women younger than 40 with and without PCOS was 30.3 and 23.9, respectively. The adjusted HR for women <=40 years, 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1-2.6), disappeared after age 40. Conclusion(s) These data suggest that routine screening for diabetes in prevention strategies does not need to be emphasized for PCOS patients at late reproductive ages if they have not been affected by glucose intolerance up to that point.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - Purpose: To examine the effect of habitual physical activity (PA) on the metabolic and hormonal profiles of women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Material(s) and Method(s): Anthropometric, metabolic and hormonal assessment and determination of habitual PA levels with a digital pedometer were evaluated in 84 women with PCOS and 67 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls. PA status was defined according to number of steps (>=7500 steps, active, or <7500 steps, sedentary). Result(s): BMI was lower in active women from both groups. Active PCOS women presented lower waist circumference (WC) and lipid accumulation product (LAP) values versus sedentary PCOS women. In the control group, active women also had lower WC, lower values for fasting and 120-min insulin, and lower LAP than sedentary controls. In the PCOS group, androgen levels were lower in active versus sedentary women (p = 0.001). In the control group, free androgen index (FAI) was also lower in active versus sedentary women (p = 0.018). Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and 2000 daily step increments were independent predictors of FAI. Each 2000 daily step increment was associated with a decrease of 1.07 in FAI. Conclusion(s): Habitual PA was associated with a better anthropometric and androgenic profile in PCOS.Copyright © 2016, Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).

N2  - AIMS: To explore the impact of the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome on health/ill health identity, how women experience this diagnosis and their health beliefs., BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common and heterogeneous condition, giving rise to a wide range of different health concerns. Previous research on polycystic ovary syndrome has been dominated by the medical perspective and less is known about the experiences and needs of women., DESIGN: A qualitative study of 32 premenopausal adult women with polycystic ovary syndrome (diagnosis confirmed by Rotterdam criteria), aged between 18 and 45 years, recruited from a primary and secondary care setting., METHODS: Thematic analysis of transcripts from 11 focus groups conducted between 2013-2015., RESULTS/FINDINGS: Women identified a range of concerns affecting personal and reproductive identity, health knowledge and beliefs: (1) delays and barriers to diagnosis; (2) general lack of empathy by the medical profession; (3) difficulty in accessing specialist referral; (4) lack of information from professionals; (5) inconsistent and sometimes unsatisfactory experiences with medications; (6) insufficient help and advice regarding in/fertility; (7) relative lack of awareness or concern about longer term risks such as diabetes; and (8) significant discrepancies between the beliefs of women with polycystic ovary syndrome and how they experienced the attitudes of healthcare professionals., CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be a divergence between women's experience and attitudes of healthcare professionals. The diagnosis, support and lived experience of women with polycystic ovary syndrome could be enhanced by better professional recognition of these concerns, improved knowledge and communication about polycystic ovary syndrome and better access to support and specialist advice.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disease in reproductive age women. The present study aimed to determine the effects of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on reproductive hormones, plasma total antioxidant status and anthropometric indices in overweight and obese PCOS women., METHODS: In this randomised controlled clinical trial, 60 women with PCOS were randomly assigned to one of two diets with energy restriction: the DASH diet and a control diet. The DASH and control diets consisted of 50-55% carbohydrate, 15-20% protein and 25-30% total fat. The DASH diet was designed to be rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and low-fat dairy products, as well as low in saturated fats, cholesterol, refined grains and sweets. In the present study, the anthropometric indices, body composition, total testosterone, androstenedione, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), free androgen index and 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picryylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity were measured before and after 3 months., RESULTS: The consumption of DASH diet compared to the control diet was associated with a significant reduction in weight [-5.78 (1.91) kg versus -4.34 (2.87) kg, P = 0.032], body mass index (BMI) [-2.29 (0.15) kg m-2 versus -1.69 (0.20) kg m-2 , P = 0.02], fat mass [-3.23(1.66) kg versus -2.13 (1.26) kg, P = 0.008] and serum androstenedione [-1.75 (1.39) ng mL-1 versus -1.02 (0.72) ng mL-1 , P-value = 0.019]. Increased concentrations of SHBG [28.80 (21.71) versus 11.66(18.82) nmol L-1 , P = 0.003) and DPPH scavenging activity [30.23% (19.09) versus 12.97% (25.12) were also found in the DASH group., CONCLUSIONS: The DASH diet could improve weight loss, BMI and fat mass. Furthermore, it could result in a significant reduction in serum androstenedione and a significant increase in antioxidant status and SHBG.Copyright © 2016 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to investigate the association between dietary carbohydrate components and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in Iran., METHODS: In this case-control study, the diagnosis of PCOS was made based on the Rotterdam criteria in hospital clinics. Dietary assessments were performed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. In total, 281 women with incident PCOS and 472 age-matched controls were assessed. Participants were interviewed through the clinics in Tehran, Iran, from February 2012 until March 2014. Average dietary glycaemic index (GI) and glycaemic load (GL) were calculated using GI of Iranian Foods Table and international tables of GI and GL values. We also assessed total dietary carbohydrate, refined grains, whole grains and fibre intakes., RESULTS: Participation rates were 97.5% among cases and 96.3% among controls. Mean (SD) dietary GI values among the controls and cases were 51.8 (4.7) and 59.7 (5.9) (P = 0.02) and GL values were 155.34 (35.2) and 173.6 (39.1) (P < 0.001), respectively. The multivariate adjusted odds ratio (OR) comparing the highest tertile of dietary GI and GL with the lowest tertile were 2.18 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.29-3.81; P-test for trend = 0.012] and 2.39 (95% CI = 1.23-3.01; P-test for trend = 0.001), respectively, with a significant trend. Fibre intake was inversely associated with PCOS (OR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.49-0.91; P-test for trend = 0.013)., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that high dietary GI and GL and low fibre intake are significantly associated with PCOS.Copyright © 2016 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.

N2  - Background: Data on dietary intake, meal patterns, and eating attitudes from women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is limited despite the fact that PCOS is associated with obesity. We aimed to test the hypothesis that women with PCOS display altered dietary intakes and eating behaviors compared to controls. Method(s): Women with PCOS (n = 72) as defined according to the modified Rotterdam criteria were compared with healthy controls (n = 30). Anthropometry included measurement of waist circumference and determination of the resting metabolic rate via indirect calorimetry. All women completed questionnaires regarding eating behavior; Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R21) and eating attitudes; Eating Attitudes Test (EAT). Group comparisons were done by Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression analysis was used for adjustments of age and BMI in a non-parametric way. Result(s): BMI was higher in women with PCOS compared to controls. Resting metabolic rate did not differ between women with women with and without PCOS after adjustment for age and BMI [1411 +/- 229 kcal/day versus 1325 +/- 193 kcal per day (P = 0.07)], whereas the respiratory exchange ratio was higher in women with PCOS than in controls [0.83 +/- 0.07 versus 0.78 +/- 0.08 (P = 0.02 after adjustments for age and BMI)]. Energy percent (E%) carbohydrates was higher in women with PCOS compared to controls (P = 0.017), but E% alcohol was lower (P = 0.036) after adjustment for age and BMI. The average total EAT scores and EAT dieting subscale scores were higher in women with PCOS compared with controls (P = 0.001 and P = 0.024, respectively) after adjustment for age and BMI. No difference was found for previous or current symptoms of bulimia nervosa. Conclusion(s): Independent of BMI and age, the resting metabolic rate did not differ between women with and without PCOS indicating that women with PCOS should have equal abilities in terms of energy metabolism to lose weight as women without PCOS. Women with PCOS showed greater concerns about their weight and dieting, and this indicates that anxiety about weight is one of the psychological symptoms of PCOS.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

N2  - CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that Croatian women with polycystic ovary syndrome compared to the controls have significantly poorer dietary habits characterised by high Glycaemic Index diets, they are less physically active during free time. and have positive significant correlation between the age and carbohydrate intake whereas the controls have positive significant correlation between the age and fat intake., INTRODUCTION: This study was aimed at comparing diets, dietary patterns and lifestyle habits of women with polycystic ovary syndrome and controls in Croatia., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this pilot, matched pair study, the participants were women of reproductive age: 12 with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and 16 healthy (between the ages of 18 and 41 years). The following data sets were collected and a,nalysed:.nutrient intake, dietary habits and physical activity, polycystic ovary syndrome symptoms, anthropometry and biochemical records., RESULTS: The analyses of dietary habits showed a significantly (p=0.030) higher score for the controls (92.4?8.7 points) compared to the women with polycystic ovary syndrome (83.3?12.2 points). There was a significant correlation between the age and intake of total carbohydrates, and intake of plant protein in the women with polycystic ovary syndrome. A significant correlation was found between the age and total fats intake, as well as intake of different types of fats, and energy intake in the controls. The free time activity index showed a significant difference (t-test: p=0.043, ANOVA: p=.004) in favour of the control group of women who were more active.

N2  - Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most important cause of anovulation in general population and infertile women. Emphasizing the importance of polycystic ovary syndrome as one of the causes of infertility and according to association between this syndrome with hormonal and metabolic disorders, this study was performed with aim to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks aerobic training on body composition, aerobic power and some women-hormones in polycystic ovary syndrome infertile women. Method(s): This randomized clinical trial study was performed on 20 polycystic ovary syndrome infertile women referring to obstetrics clinic of Bojnurd in 2015. They were randomly categorized into two groups of experimental and control (n=10 in each group). The trained group performed 12 weeks 3 days/week aerobic training with severity of 40-65 maximum heart rate reserve. Pre and post of aerobic training, sex hormones levels and body composition were collected. Data was analyzed by SPSS software (version 18) and t-test in dependent and independent groups was used for comparison of means within and between groups, respectively. PResults: Weight and LH levels reduced and Vo2max significantly increased at the end of training period (P=0.001). Concentrations of TSH, FSH and prolactin did not changed at the end of training (P>0.05). Moreover, a significant difference was observed in the levels of weight, BMI, LH and Vo2max between two groups after at the end of training period (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): According to reduced weight and LH and increased Vo2max by doing aerobics training, it can be used as a non-pharmaceutical alternative to improve PCOS patients.Copyright © 2016, Canadian Medical Association.

N2  - Background Evidence is lacking to recommend one diet over another when treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Objectives To obtain preliminary data, comparing the impact of a low-glycaemic load (LGL) vs. low-fat (LF) diet on biochemical hyperandrogenism in overweight and obese adolescents with PCOS. To ascertain feasibility of recruiting study participants, in partnership with an adolescent clinic, and implementing dietary interventions. Methods Randomized controlled trial of 19 overweight and obese adolescents with PCOS and not using hormonal contraceptives (HCs). Interventions comprised nutrition education, dietary counselling and cooking workshops to foster adherence to a LGL (45% carbohydrate, 35% fat, 20% protein) or LF (55% carbohydrate, 25% fat, 20% protein) diet over 6 months. Serum bioavailable testosterone was the primary outcome. Results Sixteen (LGL, n = 7; LF, n = 9) participants completed the study. Body fat percentage decreased (P < 0.05) in response to the interventions, with no difference between the LGL and LF groups (-1.2% vs. -2.2%; P = 0.16). Bioavailable testosterone did not change for either group (-0.4 vs. -1.8 ng dL-1; P = 0.35). Regarding feasibility, recruiting adolescents posed a challenge, and use of HCs was a main reason for ineligibility. Participants attended 5.9 of 6 in-person visits and 2.6 of 3 cooking workshops, completed 4.9 of 6 telephone counselling calls, and reported high satisfaction with the diets and cooking workshops (>=8 on a 10-cm scale). Conclusions Dietary interventions were beneficial for weight control but did not attenuate biochemical hyperandrogenism. Innovative strategies are needed to recruit adolescents for studies aimed at assessing independent effects of diet on features of PCOS.Copyright © 2015 World Obesity.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome affects 6percent of women. Symptoms include hirsutism, acne, and infertility. This research explores the impact of polycystic ovary syndrome on women's lives using photovoice. Nine participants photographed objects related to their quality of life and made diary entries explaining each photograph. Three themes emerged from thematic analysis of the diaries: control (of symptoms and polycystic ovary syndrome controlling their lives), perception (of self, others, and their situation), and support (from relationships, health care systems, and education). These findings illuminate positive aspects of living with polycystic ovary syndrome and the role pets and social networking sites play in providing support for women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

N2  - This study was designed to assess the effects of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan on insulin resistance and serum hs-CRP in overweight and obese women with PCOS. This randomized controlled clinical trial was done on 48 women diagnosed with PCOS. Subjects were randomly assigned to consume either the control (n=24) or the DASH eating pattern (n=24) for 8 weeks. The DASH diet consisted of 52% carbohydrates, 18% proteins, and 30% total fats. It was designed to be rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products and low in saturated fats, cholesterol, refined grains, and sweets. Sodium content of the DASH diet was designed to be less than 2 400 mg/day. The control diet was also designed to contain 52% carbohydrates, 18% protein, and 30% total fat. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 8 weeks intervention to measure insulin resistance and serum hs-CRP levels. Adherence to the DASH eating pattern, compared to the control diet, resulted in a significant reduction of serum insulin levels (-1.88 vs. 2.89 muIU/ml, p=0.03), HOMA-IR score (-0.45 vs. 0.80; p=0.01), and serum hs-CRP levels (-763.29 vs. 665.95 ng/ml, p=0.009). Additionally, a significant reduction in waist (-5.2 vs. -2.1 cm; p=0.003) and hip circumference (-5.9 vs. -1 cm; p<0.0001) was also seen in the DASH group compared with the control group. In conclusion, consumption of the DASH eating pattern for 8 weeks in overweight and obese women with PCOS resulted in the improvement of insulin resistance, serum hs-CRP levels, and abdominal fat accumulation.

N2  - Objective The aim of this study was to examine the effects of acute exercise on insulin signaling in skeletal muscle of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and controls (CTRL). Methods Fifteen women with obesity and PCOS and 12 body mass index-matched CTRL participated in this study. Subjects performed a 40-min single bout of exercise. Muscle biopsies were performed before and 60 min after exercise. Selected proteins were assessed by Western blotting. Results CTRL, but not PCOS, showed a significant increase in PI3-k p85 and AS160 Thr 642 after a single bout of exercise (P = 0.018 and P = 0.018, respectively). Only PCOS showed an increase in Akt Thr 308 and AMPK phosphorylation after exercise (P = 0.018 and P = 0.018, respectively). Total GLUT4 expression was comparable between groups (P > 0.05). GLUT4 translocation tended to be significantly higher in both groups after exercise (PCOS: P = 0.093; CTRL: P = 0.091), with no significant difference between them (P > 0.05). Conclusions A single bout of exercise elicited similar GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle of PCOS and CTRL, despite a slightly differential pattern of protein phosphorylation. The absence of impairment in GLUT4 translocation suggests that PCOS patients with obesity and insulin resistance may benefit from exercise training.Copyright © 2015 The Obesity Society.

N2  - The phenotype of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is known to worsen with weight gain, increased ingestion of carbohydrates and a sedentary lifestyle. The purpose of this study was to assess the dietary habits in a group of adolescent girls with PCOS. Adolescents with PCOS were recruited and asked to complete a questionnaire on their eating habits and a recall dietary diary, from which their caloric and macronutrient intake was calculated. Results were compared with those from a group of normal controls. Thirty-five women with PCOS and 46 controls were included. Girls with PCOS were less likely to have cereals for breakfast (20.7 versus 66.7%) and as a result consumed less fibre than controls. They were more likely to eat an evening meal (97.1 versus 78.3%) and eat this over an hour later when compared to controls. Despite having comparable body mass indexes, girls with PCOS ate a daily surplus calorie average of 3% versus controls that had a negative calorie intake of 0.72% (p=0.047). Ameliorating eating habits early in adolescence in girls with PCOS may improve future metabolic concerns related to a genetic predisposition and worsened by an unhealthy lifestyle.Copyright © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder with a significant psychological burden throughout the life course of affected women. Thus, use of mindful awareness may be beneficial as an adjunct to conventional medical management of women with PCOS. A randomized, controlled trial was conducted at the Evgenideion Hospital of the Athens University Medical School to explore the impact of an 8-week mindfulness stress management program on measures of depression, anxiety and stress as well as on the quality of life in reproductive age women with PCOS. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee. Twenty-three and 15 women with PCOS were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group, respectively. All participants were administered DASS21, PSS-14, PCOSQ, Daily Life and General Life Satisfaction Questionnaires and provided three-timed daily samples of salivary cortisol, before and after the intervention. Intervention group participants were provided with the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire at the day of enrolment, to check for possible placebo effect on the outcome. Post-intervention, between-group results revealed statistically significant reductions in stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as in salivary cortisol concentrations, along with an increase in Life Satisfaction and Quality of Life scores in the intervention group only. There was no significant "placebo" effect on the outcome measures. Mindfulness techniques seem promising in ameliorating stress, anxiety, depression and the quality of life in women with PCOS and could be used as an adjunct method to the conventional management of these women.Copyright © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common endocrinopathy in reproductive-age women, and associates with insulin resistance. Exercise is advocated in this disorder, but little knowledge exists on the optimal exercise regimes. We assessed the effects of high intensity interval training and strength training on metabolic, cardiovascular, and hormonal outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Material(s) and Method(s): Three-arm parallel randomized controlled trial. Thirty-one women with polycystic ovary syndrome (age 27.2 +/- 5.5 years; body mass index 26.7 +/- 6.0 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to high intensity interval training, strength training, or a control group. The exercise groups exercised three times weekly for 10 weeks. Result(s): The main outcome measure was change in homeostatic assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). HOMA-IR improved significantly only after high intensity interval training, by -0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.45, -0.20), equal to 17%, with between-group difference (p = 0.014). After high intensity interval training, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 0.2 (95% CI, 0.02, 0.5) mmol/L, with between group difference (p = 0.04). Endothelial function, measured as flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery, increased significantly after high intensity interval training, by 2.0 (95% CI, 0.1, 4.0) %, between-group difference (p = 0.08). Fat percentage decreased significantly after both exercise regimes, without changes in body weight. After strength training, anti-Mullarian hormone was significantly reduced, by -14.8 (95% CI, -21.2, -8.4) pmol/L, between-group difference (p = 0.04). There were no significant changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, adiponectin or leptin in any group. Conclusion(s): High intensity interval training for ten weeks improved insulin resistance, without weight loss, in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Body composition improved significantly after both strength training and high intensity interval training. This pilot study indicates that exercise training can improve the cardiometabolic profile in polycystic ovary syndrome in the absence of weight loss. Copyright:Copyright © 2015 Almenning et al.

N2  - Objective. To investigate whether electro-acupuncture or physical exercise influence serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC) or ovarian volume in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design. Secondary analyses of a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. Setting. University Hospital, Sweden. Patients. Seventy-four women with PCOS recruited from the general population. Interventions. Women with PCOS were randomized to 16 weeks of electro-acupuncture (14 treatments), exercise (at least three times/week), or no intervention. Main outcome measures. Serum AMH recorded at baseline, after 16 weeks of intervention, and at follow up at 32 weeks. AFC, and ovarian volume assessed by magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and at follow up at 32 weeks. Results. After 16 weeks of intervention, serum levels of AMH were significantly decreased in the electro-acupuncture group by 17.5% (p < 0.001), and differed from the change in the exercise group. AMH remained decreased by 15% (p = 0.004) also at follow up at 32 weeks, but did not differ from the exercise or the no intervention groups. There was a decrease by 8.5% (p = 0.015) in ovarian volume between baseline and follow up in the electro-acupuncture group, and by 11.7% (p = 0.01) in AFC in the physical exercise group. No other variables were affected. Conclusions. This study is the first to demonstrate that acupuncture reduces serum AMH levels and ovarian volume. Physical exercise did not influence circulating AMH or ovarian volume. Despite a within-group decrease in AFC, exercise did not lead to a between-group difference.Copyright © 2014 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive endocrinological disease with heterogeneous phenotype. Obesity contributes to the increased prevalence and severity of PCOS. Whether the intakes of major nutrients are higher in Chinese PCOS patients is still unknown., OBJECTIVES: To study the intakes of total energy, protein, fat and carbohydrate in Southwest Chinese PCOS patients., METHODS: 1854 women were included in the cross-sectional study. A population-based case-control study was conducted. The dietary habits and nutrients intake status of 169 PCOS patients and 338 age-matched controls were investigated by the method of semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire., RESULTS: The actual intake of total energy (P = 0.01) and fat (P = 0.01) were higher, but carbohydrate was lower (P = 0.01) in PCOS patients as compared with the controls. The energy percentage supplied by protein (12.33% +/- 2.27% vs. 19.26% +/- 5.91%, P<0.001) and carbohydrate (48.72% +/- 6.41% vs. 68.31% +/- 8.37%, P<0.001) were lower in Southwest Chinese PCOS patients than those of control, however, the energy percentage supplied by fat was higher (38.95% +/- 5.71% vs. 12.42% +/- 5.13%, P<0.001) in PCOS., CONCLUSIONS: Limit the intake of total energy and fat shall be recommended to the Southwest Chinese PCOS patients. Women with PCOS in Southwest China shall consult with the nutritionist for improving the dietary structure.

N2  - Given the high prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and that a lifestyle is recognized effective in development of many diseases, this study aimed to compare lifestyle of women with PCOS and healthy women. Nor are there sufficient studies on the difference between lifestyle of these people with that of healthy people. Furthermore, studies show that changes in lifestyle improve this disease. This descriptive-comparative study was conducted on 65 women with PCOS and 65 healthy women of 18 to 45 years old who presented to hospitals affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in 2013. The subjects were selected using multi stage random sampling method. The data were collected using questionnaires for diet, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and unhealthy behaviors and were analyzed in SPSS v. 17, using descriptive statistics, Man-Whitney, independent t, Chi-square and logistic regression tests. The results showed there was a significant relationship between PCOS and inappropriate diet (p=0.009), low physical activity (p=0.009), but no relationship was observed between PCOS and unhealthy behaviors. Given the results obtained, training and awareness raising is necessary for women and girls especially about appropriate diet and regular physical activity.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common chronic endocrine disorder. It has significant and diverse clinical consequences including reproductive, metabolic, and psychological morbidities as well as predisposition to malignancies. It is unclear how women with PCOS experience symptoms of this syndrome. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to clarify the dimensions and components of quality of life in iranian women with PCOS. Patients and Methods: This study was a qualitative study to explore and document perceptions of women with PCOS about their disorder and quality of life. Semi-structured interviews with open ended questions were conducted with 23 women with PCOS. The interviews were continued to reach data saturation. The study was conducted in the Reproductive Endocrinology Research Center of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. All the interviews were recorded and transcribed. Constant comparative analysis of the data was conducted manually according to the Strauss and Corbin analysis method. Result(s): The study revealed that the most important factors affecting quality of life in women with PCOS were the role functioning items as well as physical, mental, emotional, cognitive, and social dimensions. Conclusion(s): Comprehensive cares concerning various mental, emotional, cognitive, and social dimensions of quality of life should be planned for women with PCOS. © 2014, Research Institute For Endocrine Sciences and Iran Endocrine Society; Published by Kowsar Corp.

N2  - Background: Physical activity is prescribed as a component of primary management for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). This study investigates the association between physical activity and mental health as well as the exercise barriers, motivators and support providers for younger women with and without PCOS to assist in physical activity uptake and prescription for these women. Method(s): Women aged 18-50 years with (n = 153) and without PCOS (n = 64) completed a questionnaire at one time point. The questionnaire included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and a survey regarding levels of physical activity, physical activity barriers, motivators and supports. A MANCOVA assessed associations between physical activity, PCOS and mental health (specifically depression and anxiety). Descriptive and Chi square goodness of fit statistics assessed the differences in perceived barriers, motivators and support providers amongst women with and without PCOS. Result(s): Women with PCOS displayed higher severity of depression (F(1,210) = 8.32, p = 0.004) and anxiety (F(1,210) = 17.37, p < 0.001) symptoms compared to controls. Overall, for physically active women, depression was significantly less severe than in their inactive counterparts (F(2,210) = 13.62, p < 0.001). There were no differences in anxiety by physical activity status and no interaction effects between PCOS and activity status for depression or anxiety. Women with PCOS were more likely to report a lack of confidence about maintaining physical activity (X2 = 3.65; p = 0.046), fear of injury (X2 = 4.08; p = 0.043) and physical limitations (X2 = 11.92; p = 0.001) as barriers to physical activity and were more likely to be motivated to be active to control a medical condition (X2 = 7.48; p = 0.006). Women with PCOS identified more sources of support compared to women without PCOS. Conclusion(s): Physical activity is associated with lower depression in women with PCOS and differences exist in the self-reported physical activity barriers, motivators and support providers, compared to controls. Being more active may offer mental health benefits in managing PCOS. Prescribing physical activity to women with PCOS should be individualized and consider both common and PCOS-specific barriers and motivators for successful engagement. © 2014 Banting et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on lipid profiles and biomarkers of oxidative stress in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted with 48 women diagnosed withPCOS. The women were randomly assigned to consume either the control (n = 24) or DASH diet (n = 24) for 8 wk. Both diets were designed to be calorie-restricted. Both diets consisted of 52% carbohydrates, 18% proteins, and 30% total fats. The DASH diet was designed to be rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products and to be low in saturated fats, cholesterol, and refined grains. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 8-wk intervention to measure lipid profiles and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total glutathione (GSH). Result(s): Adherence to the DASH diet, compared with the control diet, resulted in a significant decrease in weight (-4.4 versus -1.5 kg; P < 0.001) and body mass index (-1.7 versus -0.6 kg/m2; P < 0.001), decreased serum triglycerides (-10.0 versus +19.2 mg/dL; P interaction = 0.005) and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (-2.0 versus +3.9 mg/dL; P interaction = 0.005). Increased concentrations of TAC (+98.6 versus -174.8 mmol/L; P interaction <0.001) and GSH (+66.4 versus -155.6 mumol/L; P interaction = 0.005) also were found in the DASH group compared with the control group. Conclusion(s): Consumption of DASH diet for 8 wk led to a significant reduction in serum insulin, triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a significant increase in TAC and GSH levels.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The present study investigated dietary intake, glucose metabolism and sex hormones in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A total of forty-five women (aged 25-40 years) with PCOS and 161 control women (aged 25-43 years) with non-PCOS-related infertility were recruited. Anthropometry, glucose tolerance and sex hormones were determined and dietary intake was assessed. Women with PCOS had lower serum sex hormone-binding globulin and increased BMI, waist:hip ratio, luteinising hormone, ratio of luteinising hormone:follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone and free androgen index (FAI). Postprandial glucose, fasting insulin and insulin resistance were elevated in women with PCOS. Women with PCOS had reduced energy and carbohydrate intake but higher fat intake. Serum sex hormone-binding globulin level was negatively associated with BMI in both groups and negatively correlated with macronutrient intake in the PCOS group with hyperandrogenism. However, FAI was positively correlated with BMI, waist circumference and glucose metabolic parameters in both groups. Therefore, women with PCOS consume lower energy and carbohydrate compared with those with non-PCOS-related infertility and macronutrient intake is only negatively associated with serum sex hormone-binding globulin level in the PCOS group with hyperandrogenism. © 2012 The Authors.

N2  - Background: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have symptoms of depression and anxiety and impaired health related quality of life (HRQoL). Here we test the post-hoc hypothesis that acupuncture and exercise improve depression and anxiety symptoms and HRQoL in PCOS women. Method(s): Seventy-two PCOS women were randomly assigned to 16 weeks of 1) acupuncture (n = 28); 2) exercise (n = 29); or 3) no intervention (control) (n = 15). Outcome measures included: change in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S), Brief Scale for Anxiety (BSA-S), Swedish Short-Form 36 (SF-36), and PCOS Questionnaire (PCOSQ) scores from baseline to after 16-week intervention, and to 16-week post-intervention follow-up. Result(s): A reduction in MADRS-S and BSA-S from baseline to 16-weeks post-intervention follow-up was observed for the acupuncture group. The SF-36 domains role physical, energy/vitality, general health perception and the mental component of summary scores improved in the acupuncture group after intervention and at follow-up. Within the exercise group the role physical decreased after treatment, while physical functioning and general health perception scores increased at follow-up. The emotion domain in the PCOSQ improved after 16-weeks of intervention within all three groups, and at follow-up in acupuncture and exercise groups. At follow-up, improvement in the infertility domain was observed within the exercise group. Conclusion(s): There was a modest improvement in depression and anxiety scores in women treated with acupuncture, and improved HRQoL scores were noted in both intervention groups. While not a primary focus of the trial, these data suggest continued investigation of mental health outcomes in women treated for PCOS.Trial registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00484705. © 2013 Stener-Victorin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Objective Diet-induced reduction in circulating insulin may be an attractive nonpharmacological treatment for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) among whom elevated insulin may exacerbate symptoms by stimulating testosterone synthesis. This study was designed to determine whether a modest reduction in dietary carbohydrate (CHO) content affects beta-cell responsiveness, serum testosterone concentration and insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS. Design In a crossover design, two diets ('Standard,' STD, 55:18:27% energy from carbohydrate/protein/fat; lower-carbohydrate, 41:19:40) were provided for 8 weeks in random order with a 4-week washout between. Patients Thirty women with PCOS. Measurements beta-cell responsiveness assessed as the C-peptide response to glucose during a liquid meal test; insulin sensitivity from insulin and glucose values throughout the test; insulin resistance (HOMA-IR); and total testosterone by immunoassay. Results Paired t-test indicated that the lower-CHO diet induced significant decreases in basal beta-cell response (PhiB), fasting insulin, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, total testosterone and all cholesterol measures, and significant increases in insulin sensitivity and dynamic ('first-phase') beta-cell response. The STD diet induced a decrease in HDL-C and an increase in the total cholesterol-to-HDL-C ratio. Across all data combined, the change in testosterone was positively associated with the changes in fasting insulin, PhiB and insulin AUC (P < 0.05). Conclusions In women with PCOS, modest reduction in dietary CHO in the context of a weight-maintaining diet has numerous beneficial effects on the metabolic profile that may lead to a decrease in circulating testosterone. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Objective This study investigates energy intake, macronutrient composition and habitual food choices in overweight/obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and controls similar for age and body mass index (BMI), and their relationship with hormonal and metabolic parameters. Design Case-control study carried out in an academic hospital in Bologna, Italy. Patients One-hundred obese or overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2) women with PCOS, diagnosed according to Rotterdam criteria, and 100 age- and BMI-matched controls. Measurements Dietary habits were investigated by means of the 7 days food diary. Fasting hormones and metabolic parameters were investigated in all subjects. Results We showed that diet does not differ between the two groups as regards energy, macronutrient and advanced glycosylated end product intake, except for a lower percentage of energy from lipids and a higher intake of fibres by PCOS women. PCOS women were characterized by a higher consumption of cheese and high-glycaemic index starchy sweets and a preference for raw oil rather than other cooked fats, compared to controls. The PCOS or control status influenced some of the relationships between dietary components, food choices and metabolic parameters, particularly insulinAUC and HDL-cholesterol. Conclusions This study did not find major differences in dietary habits between PCOS and normoandrogenic control women. Our findings support the hypothesis that specific foods may influence metabolic and hormonal pattern and that this relationship may be differently regulated in PCOS and normoandrogenic women; however, they give little support to the hypothesis of a strong dependence of PCOS status on nutritional factors. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Objective To compare glycemic index (GI) in the usual diet of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and control women and to investigate whether dietary GI is associated with body composition and anthropometric and metabolic variables across PCOS phenotypes. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting University hospital outpatient clinic. Patient(s) Sixty-one women with PCOS and 44 nonhirsute women with ovulatory cycles. Intervention(s) Metabolic work-up, biochemical and hormonal assays, assessment of body composition and rest metabolic rate, physical activity (pedometer), and food consumption (food frequency questionnaire). Main outcome measure(s) GI, glycemic load, dietary intake, and hormone and metabolic profile in PCOS versus control and in PCOS women stratified by tertiles of GI and PCOS phenotype. Result(s) Mean age was 23.7 +/- 6.3 years. Participants with PCOS had higher body fat percentage, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, lipid accumulation product, and androgen levels compared with control women. PCOS and control women in the highest tertile of GI had higher body mass index and waist circumference than those in the lowest tertile. Dietary GI was higher in the classic PCOS group. Obesity and this more severe PCOS phenotype explained 28.3% of variance in dietary GI. Conclusion(s) Dietary GI is increased in the classic PCOS phenotype and associated with a less favorable anthropometric and metabolic profile. Obesity and classic PCOS phenotype are age-independent predictors of higher dietary GI. Copyright © 2013 American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - This age-matched case-control study assessed total and segmental lean muscle mass in classic or ovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients and investigated whether lean mass is associated with hormone and metabolic features. Participants underwent anthropometric and clinical evaluation. Habitual physical activity was assessed with a digital pedometer, and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Laboratory measurements included total cholesterol, cholesterol fractions, triglycerides, glucose, total serum testosterone, serum insulin, estradiol, luteinizing hormone, and SHBG. Energy intake was calculated using a food frequency questionnaire. Classic PCOS patients had higher body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, testosterone and lipid accumulation product values than ovulatory PCOS and controls. Energy consumption, homeostasis model assessment index, SHBG, free androgen index and triglycerides, total and trunk lean mass were higher only in classic PCOS women vs. controls. Arm, leg, trunk, total or limb lean masses were not correlated with hormone levels in any of the groups. However, in PCOS women lipid accumulation product was positively correlated with total (r=0.56, p=0.001), trunk (r=0.59, p=0.001), arm (r=0.54, p=0.001), leg (r=0.44, p=0.03) and limb (r=0.48, p=0.001) lean masses. BMI was positively correlated with all lean mass segments and independently associated with total lean mass. Lipid accumulation product and BMI were independently associated with trunk lean mass variation. The increase in lean mass in classic PCOS appears to be associated with insulin resistance and central obesity rather than with energy intake, physical activity or androgens. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

N2  - Study Objective: The purpose of this study was the recording of physical activity and sedentary habits of adolescents with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): We performed a structured interview to assess the level of physical activity and sedentary habits of girls with PCOS. We used a group of healthy adolescents as controls. All girls had their age, height, weight, hip and waist circumference measured and their BMI calculated. Result(s): 81 girls (35 with PCOS and 46 controls) participated in the study. Girls with PCOS engaged in physical activities less than controls. Even when they did, the frequency and intensity of exercise was less. Also, girls with PCOS were less likely to be aware of the positive effects of exercise on their health. Girls in both groups were sedentary in excess of the 4 hours per day limit, which has been linked with obesity. Conclusion(s): Healthy teenagers were involved in a sporting activity more often and more frequently than the PCOS group. Athletic and sedentary habits of adolescents with PCOS may interact with other factors leading to obesity. © 2012 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

N2  - Objective: The recommended composition of a hypocaloric diet for obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a high-protein, low-glycemicload diet compared with a conventional hypocaloric diet on reproductive hormones, inflammatory markers, lipids, glucose, and insulin levels in obese women with PCOS. Method(s): A total of 60 overweight and obese women with PCOS who did not use insulin-sensitizing agents were recruited and randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 hypocaloric diet groups for a single-blind clinical trial. The groups included a conventional hypocaloric diet (CHCD) (15% of daily energy from protein) and a modified hypocaloric diet (MHCD) with a high-protein, low-glycemic load (30% of daily energy from protein plus lowglycemic-load foods selected from a list) that was prescribed via counseling visits weekly during 12 weeks of study. Anthropometric assessments and biochemical measurements including reproductive hormones, inflammatory factors, lipids, glucose, and insulin were performed on fasting blood samples at baseline and after 12 weeks of dietary intervention. Result(s): Weight loss was significant and similar in the 2 groups. Mean of testosterone in the MHCD and CHCD groups decreased from 1.78 +/- 0.32 to 1.31 +/- 0.26 ng/ml and from 1.51 +/- 0.12 to 1.15 +/- 0.11 ng/ml, respectively (p< 0.001). Follicle sensitizing hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and blood lipids concentrations were not changed except low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was reduced by 24.5% +/- 12.3% (p< 0.001 for both) after 12 weeks of intervention. MHCD resulted in a significant reduction in insulin level, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA), and high-sensitivity C- reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration (p< 0.001). Conclusion(s): In this study both hypocaloric diets significantly led to reduced body weight and androgen levels in these two groups of women with PCOS. The combination of high-protein and low-glycemic-load foods in a modified diet caused a significant increase in insulin sensitivity and a decrease in hsCRP level when compared with a conventional diet.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, is characterized by hyperandrogenism, oligo/amenorrhea, and polycystic ovaries. We aimed to determine whether low-frequency electroacupuncture (EA) would decrease hyperandrogenism and improve oligo/amenorrhea more effectively than physical exercise or no intervention. We randomized 84 women with PCOS, aged 18-37 yr, to 16 wk of low-frequency EA, physical exercise, or no intervention. The primary outcome measure changes in the concentration of total testosterone (T) at week 16 determined by gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was analyzed by intention to treat. Secondary outcome measures were changes in menstrual frequency; concentrations of androgens, estrogens, androgen precursors, and glucuronidated androgen metabolites; and acne and hirsutism. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 16 wk of intervention, and after a 16-wk follow-up. After 16 wk of intervention, circulating T decreased by -25%, androsterone glucuronide by -30%, and androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol-3-glucuronide by -28% in the EA group (P = 0.038, 0.030, and 0.047, respectively vs. exercise); menstrual frequency increased to 0.69/month from 0.28 at baseline in the EA group (P = 0.018 vs. exercise). After the 16-wk follow-up, the acne score decreased by -32% in the EA group (P = 0.006 vs. exercise). Both EA and exercise improved menstrual frequency and decreased the levels of several sex steroids at week 16 and at the 16-wk follow-up compared with no intervention. Low-frequency EA and physical exercise improved hyperandrogenism and menstrual frequency more effectively than no intervention in women with PCOS. Low-frequency EA was superior to physical exercise and may be useful for treating hyperandrogenism and oligo/amenorrhea. Copyright © 2011 the American Physiological Society.

N2  - To explore health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Qualitative study. Two out-patient gynecology clinics in Yorkshire, England. Fifteen young women diagnosed with PCOS were recruited. Semistructured interviews were carried out, transcribed verbatim, and subjected to thematic analysis using NVivo software version 2.0. A few areas were identified where PCOS had a positive impact upon HRQoL (e.g., improved relationships). However, overall the condition had a negative impact upon HRQoL. Weight problems (in particular the difficulties associated with managing/maintaining weight) and body perceptions appeared to be the most significant contributors to a reduced HRQoL. Menstrual dysfunction, fertility issues, and hirsutism also had adverse affects on emotional well-being, self-perception (including poor body image, self-consciousness, & low self-esteem), social functioning, and sexual behavior. A number of participants described receiving insufficient information from health care professionals (HCPs) and negative experiences in relation to the diagnosis and management of their condition. Overall, PCOS has a negative impact on the HR QoL of adolescent girls with the condition. Emotional and social functioning appeared to be most affected rather than areas of physical functioning. Future research is needed to identify ways to improve communication between adolescents with PCOS and their HCPs, particularly around the diagnosis and potential for infertility. Finally, HCPs need to be more aware of the emotional impact of PCOS upon adolescents' HRQoL and of the potential for poor sexual health through risk-taking behaviors that may occur due to the potential loss of fertility. © 2011 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.

N2  - The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex polygenic disorder in which environmental factors play an important modifying role. We aimed to find differences in diet and life-style that might contribute to the development of PCOS among overweight or obese premenopausal women. We compared diet composition and self-reported physical activity among 22 patients with PCOS and 59 women without androgen excess recruited from a total of 113 consecutive premenopausal women reporting for management of weight excess. After correcting for a difference in age between women with PCOS and controls, there were no overall statistical significant differences between them in the total caloric intake, in the intake of macro- and micro-nutrients, caffeine, fiber and alcohol, in the proportion of women exercising regularly, or in the number of hours of exercise per week. The proportion of fat in the diets of the overweight and obese women irrespective of PCOS was well-above current recommendations, yet this excessive fat intake occurred at the expense of monounsaturated fatty acids mostly. In conclusion, diet composition and physical activity were apparently not decisive for the development of PCOS among overweight and obese premenopausal women. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of a high protein (HP) and a normal protein (NP) diet on patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and body mass index-matched controls in a sample of southern Brazilian women. This 8-week randomized trial was carried out at a university gynecological endocrinology clinic and included 18 patients with PCOS and 22 controls. Changes in weight, body composition, hormone, and metabolic profile were analyzed in women randomized to receive HP (30% protein, 40% carbohydrate, and 30% lipid) or NP (15% protein, 55% carbohydrate, and 30% lipid). The energy content was estimated for each participant at 20-25 kcal/kg current weight/day. Physical activity, blood pressure, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, and fasting and 2-h glucose and insulin remained stable during the intervention in PCOS and controls, even in the presence of weight loss. There were no changes in lipid profile in either group. In contrast, body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, percent of body fat, and sum of trunk skinfolds decreased significantly after both diets in both groups. Total testosterone also decreased in PCOS and controls regardless of diet. In conclusion, calorie reduction, rather than protein content, seemed to affect body composition and hormonal profile in this short-term study. These findings emphasize the role of non-pharmacological interventions to reduce weight and ameliorate the anthropometric and clinical phenotype in PCOS. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation. Around 60% of PCOS patients are obese. Weight loss has consistently been shown to improve the clinical status of women with PCOS. We hypothesized that dietary factors are associated with the hormonal and metabolic abnormalities of PCOS. This case-control study included 43 women with PCOS and 37 ovulatory, nonhirsute controls matched to the study group by body mass index. Age ranged from 14 to 38 years. Both groups underwent anthropometric, laboratory, and nutritional assessment. End points included diet composition, body fat, and hormonal and metabolic variables related to insulin resistance. The groups had similar intake of energy, carbohydrate (53.51% +/- 8.36% vs 51.83% +/- 10.06%), protein (15% [12-18] vs 16% [13-19]), and total fat (30.51% +/- 7.90% vs 30.80% +/- 7.97%). Total body fat, sum of trunk skinfold measurements, and waist circumference were higher in the PCOS group (P < .05). Sex hormone-binding globulin was lower in PCOS patients than in controls, whereas total testosterone, free androgen index, postprandial glucose, fasting and postprandial insulin, homeostatic model assessment index, triglycerides, and total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < .050) were higher. Homeostatic model assessment index was correlated with central obesity in PCOS patients and controls alike. No association was detected between androgen status and macronutrient intake. In conclusion, central obesity and insulin resistance were not strictly associated with energy intake or dietary macronutrient composition in women with PCOS. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) commonly have insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is associated with marked abnormalities of lipoprotein size and subclass particle concentration. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a moderate-intensity exercise program without weight loss on lipoprotein profiles in women with PCOS. METHOD(S): Thirty-seven sedentary PCOS women were randomized to either an 8- to 12-wk ramp-up followed by a 12-wk moderate-intensity exercise program (16-24 wk total, ~228 min.wk-1 at 40-60% peak VO2, n = 21) or control (no change in lifestyle, n = 16). PCOS was defined as <=8 menses per year and hyperandrogenism (biochemical or clinical with Ferriman-Gallwey score >=8). Fasting lipoprotein profiles were obtained before and after the intervention. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to quantify the following: average particle size, total and subclass concentrations of HDL, LDL, and VLDL particles, and calculated HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and VLDL triglycerides. Wilcoxon exact rank sums tests were used to compare changes in these parameters in the exercise group relative to controls. RESULT(S): Twenty women (8 exercisers, 12 controls) completed the study. Comparing exercisers to controls, significant changes were seen in concentrations of the following lipoprotein parameters that are associated with decreased insulin resistance: decreased large VLDL (P = 0.007), calculated triglycerides (P = 0.003), VLDL triglycerides (P = 0.003), and medium/small HDL (P = 0.031) and increased large HDL (P = 0.002) and average HDL size (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): In this trial, moderate-intensity exercise without significant weight loss improved several components of the lipoprotein profiles of women with PCOS. These findings support the beneficial role of moderate exercise in this high-risk population. © 2009 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

N2  - We have recently shown that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with high muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). Animal studies support the concept that low-frequency electroacupuncture (EA) and physical exercise, via stimulation of ergoreceptors and somatic afferents in the muscles, may modulate the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of these interventions on sympathetic nerve activity in women with PCOS. In a randomized controlled trial, 20 women with PCOS were randomly allocated to one of three groups: low-frequency EA (n = 9), physical exercise (n = 5), or untreated control (n = 6) during 16 wk. Direct recordings of multiunit efferent postganglionic MSNA in a muscle fascicle of the peroneal nerve before and following 16 wk of treatment. Biometric, hemodynamic, endocrine, and metabolic parameters were measured. Low-frequency EA (P = 0.036) and physical exercise (P = 0.030) decreased MSNA burst frequency compared with the untreated control group. The low-frequency EA group reduced sagittal diameter (P = 0.001), while the physical exercise group reduced body weight (P = 0.004) and body mass index (P = 0.004) compared with the untreated control group. Sagittal diameter was related to MSNA burst frequency (Rs = 0.58, P < 0.005) in the EA group. No correlation was found for body mass index and MSNA in the exercise group. There were no differences between the groups in hemodynamic, endocrine, and metabolic variables. For the first time we demonstrate that low-frequency EA and physical exercise lowers high sympathetic nerve activity in women with PCOS. Thus, treatment with low-frequency EA or physical exercise with the aim to reduce MSNA may be of importance for women with PCOS. Copyright © 2009 the American Physiological Society.

Methods was measured during an incremental treadmill test and maximal isometric (ImS) and isokinetic knee extensor strength (IkS) (120degree/second) were assessed by isokinetic dynamometry. Main outcome measures, ImS, IkS, waist circumference, blood lipids, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment [HOMA2]), C-reactive protein (CRP), hormonal profile. Results PCOS women had higher levels of testosterone and free testosterone (P <= 0.05), but there were no significant differences in any cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk markers between the groups. was similar in women with PCOS and healthy controls (PCOS 26.0 +/- 4.1 ml/kg/minute, controls 25.7 +/- 3.8 ml/kg/minute; P = 0.90), as was ImS (PCOS 1.50 +/- 0.54 Nm/kg, controls 1.50 +/- 0.47 Nm/kg; P = 0.96) and IkS (PCOS 1.04 +/- 0.32 Nm/kg, controls 1.16 +/- 0.23 Nm/kg; P = 0.32). was inversely related to waist circumference, insulin, HOMA2 and CRP. Waist circumference was inversely associated with ImS and IkS. No significant associations between exercise parameters and hormonal variables were identified. Conclusions Compared to age- and weight-matched healthy overweight and obese women with similar insulin resistance and CVD risk profiles, women with PCOS had similar aerobic capacity and muscle strength. This suggests PCOS, at least in the absence of an adverse metabolic profile is unlikely to limit physical function. Larger studies examining the effects of PCOS on exercise tolerance in a diverse range of PCOS phenotypes is required. © RCOG 2009 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) presents in adolescence, and obesity is a common finding. The benefits and risks of alternate approaches to the management of PCOS in obese adolescent women are not clear. Objective(s): We investigated the effects of metformin, oral contraceptives (OCs), and/or lifestyle modification in obese adolescent women with PCOS. Design(s): Two small, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials were performed. Patients and Participants: A total of 79 obese adolescent women with PCOS participated. Intervention(s): In the single treatment trial, subjects were randomized to metformin, placebo, a lifestyle modification program, or OC. In the combined treatment trial, all subjects received lifestyle modification and OC and were randomized to metformin or placebo. Main Outcome Measure(s): Serum concentrations of androgens and lipids were measured. Result(s): Lifestyle modification alone resulted in a 59% reduction in free androgen index with a 122% increase in SHBG. OC resulted in a significant decrease in total testosterone (44%) and free androgen index (86%) but also resulted in an increase in C-reactive protein (39.7%) and cholesterol (14%). The combination of lifestyle modification, OC, and metformin resulted in a 55% decrease in total testosterone, as compared to 33% with combined treatment and placebo, a 4% reduction in waist circumference, and a significant increase in HDL (46%). Conclusion(s): In these preliminary trials, both lifestyle modification and OCs significantly reduce androgens and increase SHBG in obese adolescents with PCOS. Metformin, in combination with lifestyle modification and OC, reduces central adiposity, reduces total testosterone, and increases HDL, but does not enhance overall weight reduction.

N2  - Context: In overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the benefits of the addition of exercise to an energy-restricted diet in further improving cardiometabolic risk factors and reproductive function has not been extensively studied. Objective(s): The objective was to evaluate the effects of aerobic and aerobic-resistance exercise when combined with an energy-restricted high protein diet (5000-6000 kJ/d) on metabolic risk factors and reproductive function in women with PCOS. Design and Setting: A 20-wk outpatient, randomized, parallel study was conducted in a metropolitan research clinic. Patients and Intervention: Ninety-four overweight and obese women with PCOS (age 29.3 +/- 0.7 yr; body mass index 36.1 +/- 0.5 kg/m2) were randomized to diet only (DO; n = 30), diet and aerobic exercise (DA; n = 31), or diet and combined aerobic-resistance exercise (DC; n = 33). Main Outcome Measure(s): Weight, body composition, cardiometabolic risk factors, hormonal status, menstrual cyclicity, and ovulatory function were assessed. Result(s): All interventions reduced weight(DO 8.9 +/- 1.6%,DA 10.6 +/- 1.7%, and DC8.7 +/- 1.7%; P < 0.001) with no difference between treatments (P = 0.7, time x treatment). Fat mass decreased more (3 kg) and fat-free mass decreased less (2 kg) in DA and DC compared with DO (P <= 0.03). Reductions in blood pressure (5.6/2.7 mm Hg), triglycerides (0.4 mmol/liter), total cholesterol (0.5 mmol/liter), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.1 mmol/liter), glucose (0.2 mmol/liter), fasting insulin (4.3 mIU/liter), testosterone (0.4 nmol/liter), and free androgen index (2.8) (P < 0.001) and improvements in SHBG (7.0 nmol/liter) and reproductive function occurred in all groups, with no difference between treatments. Conclusion(s): In overweight and obese women with PCOS, the addition of aerobic or combine daerobic resistance exercise to an energy-restricted diet improved body composition but had no additional effect on improvements in cardiometabolic, hormonal, and reproductive outcomes relative to diet alone.

N2  - This study compared the psychological effects of a low-protein high-carbohydrate (LPHC) diet and a high-protein low-carbohydrate (HPLC) diet in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Twenty-five overweight women with PCOS were matched for age, weight, and whether they were trying to conceive. They were randomly allocated to the LPHC or HPLC diet for 16 weeks. All participants attended a weekly exercise, group support and educational program. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale were administered at the beginning and end of the study. The HPLC diet was associated with significant reduction in depression and improvement in self-esteem. There was no change in any psychological measures for the LPHC group. There was no difference in weight loss between the groups. Due to enhanced feelings of well-being, it is possible that HPLC diets may be associated with better compliance and hence be more successful in the long term treatment of obesity. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disease closely related to several risk factors for cardiovascular disease. An impaired cardiopulmonary functional capacity was previously demonstrated in PCOS women. No data regarding the effects of a structured exercise training (ET) program on cardiopulmonary functional capacity in PCOS women are available. Objective(s): Our objective was to evaluate the effects of a 3-month ET program on cardiopulmonary functional capacity in young PCOS women. Design and Setting: A prospective baseline-randomized clinical study was conducted at the University "Federico II" of Naples, School of Medicine (Italy). Patient(s): Ninety young overweight PCOS women were enrolled. Mean Outcome Measures: Ninety young PCOS women were randomly subdivided into two groups, each composed of 45 subjects. The PCOS-T (trained) group underwent a 3-month structured ET program, whereas the PCOS-UnT (untrained) group did not. Hormonal and metabolic profiles and cardiopulmonary and exercise parameters were evaluated. Result(s): After 3-month ET, PCOS-T showed a significant improvement in peak oxygen consumption (+35.4%; P < 0.001) and in maximal workload (+37.2%; P < 0.001). In PCOS-T we also observed a significant reduction in body mass index (+4.5%; P < 0.001) and in C-reactive protein (-10%; P < 0.001), and a significant (P < 0.001) improvement in insulin sensitivity indexes. After 3 months, no changes were observed in PCOS-UnT. Conclusion(s): A 3-month structured ET program improves cardiopulmonary functional capacity in young PCOS women.

N2  - Context: Insulin resistance is a feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and it is related to mitochondrial function, particularly with maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). At the moment, no evaluation of cardiopulmonary functional capacity in young patients with PCOS has been performed. Objective(s): Our objective was to assess cardiopulmonary functional capacity in young PCOS overweight patients. Design and Setting:Weconducted a prospective baseline-controlled clinical study at University "Federico II" of Naples, School of Medicine (Naples, Italy). Patient(s): Forty-five PCOS patients were matched with 45 healthy women for age (mean +/- SD, 21.3 +/- 2.0 vs. 21.6 +/- 1.9 yr, respectively) and body mass index (29.4 +/- 3.6 vs. 29.0 +/- 3.4 kg/m2, respectively). Mean Outcome Measures: We assessed hormonal and metabolic pattern and functional capacity by cardiopulmonary exercise testing to evaluate maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), oxygen consumption at anaerobic threshold (VO 2AT), and the maximal workload at peak exercise. Result(s): VO 2max (17.0 +/- 3.7 vs. 26.8 +/- 3.5 ml/kg.min), oxygen consumption at anaerobic threshold (13.9 +/- 3.0 vs. 21.2 +/- 3.8 ml/kg.min), and maximal workload at peak exercise (101.3 +/- 25.2 vs. 135 +/- 22.6 W) were significantly (P < 0.001) reduced in PCOS subjects compared with healthy women. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that only homeostasis model assessment appears to have a strong negative linear relation with VO2max in PCOS. No relation was found in controls. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate a reduced cardiopulmonary functional capacity in young PCOS patients. Copyright © 2006 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that the dietary intake and dietary composition of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with indices of glycemic status. We hypothesized that women with PCOS would consume a diet higher in total energy, fat, and specific foods with a high glycemic index than would healthy, control-group women and that dietary composition would be associated with indices of insulin resistance and secretion among women with PCOS. Design(s): Cohort study. Setting(s): Research center on a university campus. Patient(s): Thirty women with PCOS and 27 healthy, age-, race-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched control women. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Nutrient intake data were collected from a food questionnaire and a 4-day food record. Fasting sera were analyzed for concentrations of insulin and glucose; estimates of insulin resistance were calculated. Result(s): Consumption of total energy, macronutrients, micronutrients, and high glycemic index foods was similar between the groups. However, the PCOS group consumed significantly more white bread (7.9 +/- 4.4 vs. 5.5 +/- 2.9 servings over 4 days) and tended to consume more fried potatoes than did the control group (1.0 +/- 1.5 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.7 servings over 4 days). The PCOS group had a significantly greater fasting insulin concentration (22.5 +/- 14.9 vs. 15.1 +/- 8.3 muIU/mL) and a significantly lower glucose-to-insulin ratio (4.7 +/- 2.1 vs. 7.6 +/- 5.2) than the control group. Within the PCOS group, HOMA-IR and HOMA-%beta-cell function were significantly associated with BMI. The HOMA-IR, HOMA-%beta-cell, fasting insulin, and glucose-to-insulin ratio were not positively associated with measures of diet composition. Conclusion(s): Compared with matched control women, women with PCOS exhibited a dietary pattern that was marked by consumption of a greater amount of specific foods with a high glycemic index; however, diet composition was not associated with the greater fasting insulin concentration or with lower glucose-to-insulin ratio that was observed in the PCOS group. © 2006 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Objective To obtain data from a pilot randomized trial on the effect of metformin therapy and lifestyle modification on ovulation and androgen concentrations in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Setting Academic medical center. Patient(s) Thirty-eight overweight or obese women with PCOS. Intervention(s) All subjects were randomized to one of four 48-week interventions: metformin 850 mg two times per day, lifestyle modification plus metformin 850 mg two times per day, lifestyle modification plus placebo, or placebo alone. Main outcome measure(s) Recruitment, dropout, and compliance with a long-term lifestyle intervention in PCOS; preliminary estimates of treatment effect on ovulation, as measured by weekly urinary pregnanediol glucuronide, and on total T and free androgen index. Result(s) It was necessary to screen seven women to have one subject randomized. The dropout rate was 39%, with the majority of dropouts occurring within the first 24 weeks. Mean body mass index was >39 mg/kg2. Modest weight reduction was found in all treatment groups, with the most significant reduction occurring with the combination of metformin and lifestyle intervention. Significant androgen reduction occurred in the combination group only. Ovulation rates did not differ significantly between groups. However, when data were analyzed by presence or absence of weight reduction in subjects, independent of treatment group, the estimated odds ratio for weight loss was 9.0 (95% confidence interval 1.2-64.7) with respect to regular ovulation. If weight loss occurred during metformin therapy, the odds ratio for regular ovulation was 16.2 (95% confidence interval 4.4-60.2). Conclusion(s) Key methodologic issues for a large-scale, randomized trial of lifestyle intervention in PCOS include minimizing early dropout from the lifestyle intervention and including a range of body mass index that is not skewed toward severe obesity. Weight reduction might play the most significant role in restoration of ovulation in obese women with PCOS. © 2004 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dietary intake and physical activity contribute to obesity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). DESIGN: Case-control study. SUBJECTS: A total of 84 cases and 79 neighborhood controls of similar age. MEASUREMENTS: Fasting insulin, body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2), waist/hip ratio, Block Food Frequency Questionnaire, Paffenbarger Physical Activity Questionnaire. RESULT(S): Although women with PCOS had a higher BMI than control women, an overall comparison of women with and without PCOS showed no significant difference in dietary intake. However, stratification by BMI revealed that lean women with PCOS reported significantly lower energy intake than lean women without PCOS. CONCLUSION(S): Differences in dietary intake and physical activity alone are not sufficient to explain differences in weight between women with and without PCOS. Further research is necessary to determine the relative contributions of lifestyle factors and metabolism to obesity in PCOS.

N2  - Objective We performed this study as a pilot experiment to investigate the short term effects of two diets of varying composition on weight loss as the primary outcome in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) seeking fertility. Design Randomized clinical trial. Setting Academic medical center. Patient(s) Thirty-five obese women with PCOS. Intervention(s) We examined the effects of a 1-month dietary intervention on the PCOS phenotype. Participants were randomized to one of two energy-restricted diets; high protein (HP: 30% protein, 40% carbohydrate, and 30% fat) or high carbohydrate (HC: 15% protein, 55% carbohydrate, and 30% fat). The fat content was held constant in both diets. Main outcome measure(s) Primary - change in body weight; Secondary - biometric, hormonal, lipid and lipoprotein, and markers of glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism. Result(s) Twenty-six women completed the study. Both the HP (-3.7 +/- 1.9 kg) and HC (-4.4 +/- 1.5 kg) diets resulted in significant weight loss, but there was no significant difference in mean weight loss between the two groups. There were also no differences between diets on a variety of measures including circulating androgens, measures of glucose metabolism, and leptin. However, the effects of a hypocaloric diet per se on improving metabolic and reproductive abnormalities in a group of PCOS women were marked by a decline in circulating androgens (P=.03), fasting and area under the curve (AUC) insulins (P<.05) on a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and fasting and AUC leptin levels (P<.0001). There was a high prevalence of menstrual bleeding during the trial (14 out of 26 patients). Conclusion(s) Those who completed the short-term hypocaloric diet had a significant weight loss and a significant improvement in their reproductive and metabolic abnormalities. There was no increased benefit to a high-protein diet. Future diet studies evaluating the ideal composition of a hypocaloric diet in women with PCOS will require a large study population, and will most likely require a multicenter trial. © 2004 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Objective: To determine whether weight loss in obese, hyperandrogenic, anovulatory women is associated with resumption of ovulation and/or with changes in insulin, androgen, and gonadotropin concentrations. Design(s): Prospective, randomized, controlled study. Setting(s): University research center. Patient(s): Twelve obese, hyperandrogenic, anovulatory women. Intervention(s): Twelve-week weight loss program in treatment (n = 6); 12-week 'waiting list' in control group (n = 6). Main Outcome Measure(s): [1] Ovulation; [2] fasting insulin and glucose measurements; [3] sex hormone- binding globulin (SHBG), total and non-SHBG T concentrations; [4] LH pulse frequency, amplitude, and concentration; and [5] FSH concentration. Result(s): In contrast with the control group who showed no change in weight, ovulation status, or hormone levels, women in the treatment group lost an average of 16.2 kg and showed a significant increase in SHBG, a significant decline in non-SHBG T, and a decline (though nonsignificant) in fasting insulin. Four of six subjects resumed ovulation. However, no changes were evident in LH pulse frequency or amplitude or in mean LH and FSH concentrations. Conclusion(s): Weight loss in obese, hyperandrogenic, anovulatory women appears to reduce insulin and non-SHBG T concentrations despite the absence of a change in gonadotropin secretion and may lead to resumption of ovulation.
