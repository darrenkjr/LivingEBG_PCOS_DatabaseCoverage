N2  - Introduction: The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common condition associated with chronic anovulation affecting 4 to 6% of reproductive age women. Aim(s): To compare the effectiveness of laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) for ovulation induction with gonadotropins in clomiphene-resistant PCOS in terms of ovulation, pregnancy, live birth, abortion, multiple pregnancies, and complication like ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Setting and design: A prospective hospital-based randomized trial. Material(s) and Method(s): It was a prospective study, which was carried out from January 2012 to May 2015. Totally, 89 women were evaluated in the study, out of which 44 women were in gonadotropin group and 45 were in LOD group. Statistical analysis: Standard statistical analysis was done and significance of difference in results was tested by chi-square test. Result(s): Ovulation rate in gonadotropin group was 75.0% at 6 months, whereas in LOD group, it was 20% at 3 months and was increased up to 66.66% after addition of clomiphene citrate and gonadotropin. The primary outcome in terms of pregnancy in gonadotropin group was 45.45% after 6 cycles and in LOD group was 11.11% after 3 cycles and 40.00% after 6 cycles with supplementation of clomiphene citrate and gonadotropin. Conclusion(s): The ongoing pregnancy rate from ovulation induction with LOD alone was significantly less but if supplemented by clomiphene citrate and gonadotropin, it seems equivalent to ovulation induction with gonadotropin, but the former procedure carries a lower risk of multiple pregnancies.Copyright © 2017, Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 3-8% of adolescents. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism and oligoovulation/anovulation. PCOS has a negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, the extents to which factors influence total HRQoL of adolescents are not known. Adult PCOS patients have a higher incidence of binge eating than the general reproductive-age female population. Limited data on binge eating in adolescents with PCOS are available. Aim of this study was to investigate how PCOS and its associated factors, including binge eating, affect the HRQoL of adolescent girls. Method(s): This case-control study recruited 63 adolescent girls 13-18 years of age with PCOS and 66 age-matched healthy controls. The PCOS health-related quality of life questionnaire (PCOSQ) and Binge Eating Scale (BES) were used. Multiple linear regression was executed to establish exact predictors and their effect on total HRQoL. Result(s): HRQoL was significantly lower in adolescents with PCOS than controls (4.9 (interquartile range (IQR) 1.5) vs. 5.8 (IQR 0.9) points). The lowest scores were found in the body hair and weight domains. BES results were not significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the control group (p = 0.727). The main predictors for total HRQoL were PCOS diagnosis per se (beta = -1.002; p < 0.001), BES score (beta = -0.27; p = 0.004) and body mass index (BMI) percentile (beta = -0.007; p = 0.013). Conclusion(s): The lower HRQoL in adolescents with PCOS is attributable to the diagnosis of PCOS, BES score and BMI percentile, confirming the importance of tailoring clinical interventions and counselling to address the domains (i.e., symptoms of hirsutism and weight concerns) causing distress and lowering HRQoL. Further implementation research is required to evaluate the impact of targeted interventions on the HRQoL of adolescent girls with PCOS.Copyright: © 2022 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Obese women with PCOS are at high risk for developing diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A baseline oral glucose tolerance test (2hrs-OGTT) annually is an important to screen for dysglycemia in women with PCOS particularly those with at least one risk factor. Due to its advantages by fasting is not required and less day-to-day variability during periods of stress or illness, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) might consider a convenient screening tool. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of HbA1c versus 2hrs-OGTT in the diagnosis of glycemic disorders in women with PCOS and to evaluate the correlation between glycemic disorders, insulin resistance (IR), and anthropometric measures. Patients and Methods: One hundred and thirty women of a mean age 26.3 +/- 6.85 year were diagnosed with PCOS according to Rotterdam 2003 criteria in Basrah, Southern Iraq. All women were examined for weight, BMI and waist circumference then they were sent for fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2hrs-OGTT, HbA1c, and fasting insulin to assess IR. Result(s): By 2hrs-OGTT, impaired glucose tolerance and T2DM were diagnosed in 16.1% and 2.4% of women with PCOS respectively and 6.7% of lean women were prediabetes. HbA1c was underestimate the diagnosis of T2DM (0.8%) and overestimate prediabetes (20%) (p=0.011) and at HbA1c= 5.55%, the specificity was (74.3%) and sensitivity (56.5%) to discriminate normal from abnormal glucose status in women with PCOS (AUC: 0.645; 95% C.I.: 0.503-0.77; p = 0.03). One hundred women (76.9%) were either overweight or obese and most of them had IR (78%). Conclusion(s): screening of glycemic disorders is a crucial for PCOS by using 2hrs-OGTT regardless risk factor and HbA1c seems to be unsatisfactory screening tool to predict glycemic disorders in women with PCOS.

N2  - Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age associated with insulin resistance leading to hyperandrogenism, anovulation, infertility and weight gain. As improvement in insulin resistance helps in weight reduction and vice versa, Metformin and Myoinositol being insulin sensitizers improve biochemical, clinical and anthropometric parameters in PCOS. This study was done to compare the effects of these drugs on anthropometric parameters in PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective, open labeled, randomized, comparative, clinical study was conducted on 60 patients. The patients were randomly divided in two groups of 30 each to receive either of the following two treatments: Group I: Tab Myo-inositol 1g twice daily. Group II: Tab Metformin 500mg thrice daily for 24 weeks. Anthropometric parameters were assessed by measuring body weight, BMI (Body mass index), waist circumference, hip circumference, WHR (waist hip ratio) at baseline and subsequently at the end of 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Result(s): In both the groups, there was statistically significant improvement in over a period of 24 weeks. In group 1, the values for weight at baseline, 12 weeks & 24 weeks are 63.96+/-.90, 62.33+/-.88 and 61.20+/-.85 while in group II the values were 63.58+/-1.88, 62.26+/-1.74 and 60.86+/-1.65. In group I, the values for BMI at baseline, 12 weeks & 24 weeks were 26.45+/-.41, 25.78+/-.42 and 25.31+/-.40 while in group II the values were 26.09+/-.76, 25.53+/-.71 and 24.96+/-.68 respectively. In group I WHR values were 0.79+/-.007, 0.78+/-.007 and 0.78+/-.007 while in group II 0.79+/-.010, 0.79+/-0.108, 0.79+/-.011 at baseline, 12 weeks & 24 weeks respectively. However, on comparing both the groups at 12 and 24 weeks, no statistically significant difference was observed in all the parameters. Conclusion(s): There was a definite improvement in anthropometric parameters with both metformin and myo-inositol but on comparing these drugs, no significant difference was observed. Thus, myo-inositol can also be used as an alternative to metformin for the treatment of PCOS.

N2  - Purpose: To explore the value of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with different phenotypes and ages, and to identify the relationship between hyperandrogenism (HA) and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM), in a Chinese cohort. Method(s): A total of2262 women (1631 with PCOS and 631 controls) were enrolled. The serum AMH and total testosterone (TT) were analyzed, the AMH levels of each subgroup were compared, and the value of each phenotype and age group of patients with PCOS was evaluated. Result(s): The level of AMH in women with PCOS (mean+/-SD, 8.63+/-4.73 ng/mL) was higher than that in controls (5.57+/-3.31 ng/mL) (P<0.01). The level of AMH in the PCOM subgroup (11.19+/-6.4 ng/mL) was significantly higher than that in the HA subgroup (8.58+/-4.74 ng/mL) (P<0.01), and both were higher than that in controls (P<0.01). AMH was higher in PCOS patients than in controls, but the same values were found in subgroups of PCOS patients under 30 years old. Conclusion(s): AMH changed in different subgroups of PCOS, which was the possible reason why AMH was not a diagnostic indicator. However, AMH could help to differentiate between clinical subgroups, as it was strongly related with PCOM but not with HA. AMH changed substantially with age, but was stable in PCOS patients under 30 years old.Copyright © 2021 Ran et al. This work is published and licensed by Dove Medical Press Limited.

N2  - Objective: To determine the association between hyperandrogenism (HA) and polycystic ovarian morphology in a Chinese cohort of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and the usefulness of anti-Mullerian hormone Methods: Patients who visited the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Indus Medical College Tando Muhammad Khan between May 2020 and October 2020 were the subjects of a prospective case-control study. According to Rotterdam criteria, 50 females with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and 50 females without the condition participated in the study. Result(s): An teenage patient clinic at our hospital enrolled 100 consecutive patients (50 by PCOS, 50 by healthy controls aged equal to the adolescent patients). Menstrual anomaly and hirsutism were most common in the study group, while vaginal discharge was most common in the control group. Analyses of anthropometric measures between the two groups showed a significant difference (p<0.05). In the PCOS group, both plasma fasting insulin (p-value = 0.001) and HOMA index (p value =0.003) had statistically greater values. PCOS patients also had significantly higher means of fT and 17-OH-P, as well as LH and LH/FSH ratios. Serum AMH levels were found to be negatively correlated with FSH levels in all patients (r=-0.238, p=0.031). The AUC value indicated by ROC analysis for distinguishing PCOS was 0.678. However, the sensitivity and specificity scores according to the highest Youden index were 47.8% and 76.1%, respectively. Conclusion(s): The Anti-Mullerian hormone level is also linked to the existence of polycystic ovary morphology, which suggests that the AMH level might have a role in the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS.Copyright © 2022 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

N2  - Introduction: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex reproductive disorder characterised by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic/enlarged ovary. Although clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism is one of the major features of PCOS, biochemical hyperandrogenism in the form of high testosterone and/or Free Androgen Index (FAI) is rarely observed in the Asian Indians. Aim(s): To assess various androgens to determine best available biomarker of androgens in PCOS from North India. Material(s) and Method(s): This case-control study was conducted at Department of Reproductive Biology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, between January 2016 to December 2019. During this period 137 female with PCOS and 49 female as control were included. Serum total testosterone (T), FAI, Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulphate (DHEAS), androstenedione and Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were measured besides assessment of hirsutism using the Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) scale. Statistical differences were derived using Mann-Whitney U test, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and Spearman's correlation test. Result(s): There were 87 PCOS cases with phenotype A, 25 PCOS cases with phenotype B, 10 PCOS cases with phenotype C and 15 PCOS cases with phenotype D. The mean age was 23.7 years in the PCOS group and 26.2 years in the control group. The mean body mass index in the PCOS group was 25.23 kg/m2 and in the control was 22.6 kg/m2. FG score of >=9 was observed in 75.9% PCOS cases. High (mean+2SD) levels of T (>=0.51 ng/ mL), FAI (>=2.55), DHEAS (>=309 ug/dL), androstenedione (>=2.2 ng/mL) and DHT (>=462 pg/mL) were observed in 35.29%, 56.25%, 14.18%, 18.62% and 61.38%, cases, respectively. Mean DHT value was 584.27 pg/mL in study group whereas in control was 257.16 pg/mL (p-value <0.0001) and area under ROC curve was 0.895. Similarly, area under ROC curve was 0.86, 0.817, 0.721 and 0.63 for FAI, testosterone, DHEAS and androstenedione, respectively. Spearman's correlation test of androgens with body mass index, age and FG Score did not find any associations with DHT. Conclusion(s): Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is best available biomarker and can be considered as diagnostic biomarker of hyperandrogenemia in PCOS women from north India.Copyright © 2022 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

N2  - Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine problem with complex diagnosis in adolescents. Therefore, it is important to identify reliable biomarkers that can be used in the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents. To investigate the diagnostic value of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin-A (INH-A) and insulin-like peptide-3 (INSL3) in adolescents with PCOS, and to explain the relationship between these hormones and the clinical / laboratory findings of hyperandrogenism. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-five girls aged 15-20 years who were diagnosed with PCOS were included in the present study. The control group consisted of healthy adolescents who had regular menstrual cycles for at least two years and were compatible with the study group according to age and body mass index (BMI). The hormonal profile was assessed in the PCOS and control group. Transabdominal pelvic ultrasonography was performed only in the PCOS group. Result(s): AMH and INH-A levels were found to be significantly higher in the PCOS group than control group. While the INSL3 did not correlate with anthropometric or laboratory parameters, AMH level showed a positive correlation with the WC SDS, waist / hip ratio, FAI, LH, fT and INH-A. Moreover, INH-A level showed a positive correlation with WC SDS, LH, LH / FSH ratio, SHBG and AMH. In receiver-operating characteristic analysis, the cut-off value for AMH for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents was 5.8 ng / mL that for INH-A was 9.3 pg/mL (the specificity and sensitivity were 86% and 70% and 66% and 82% respectively). When AMH and INH-A were used in combination, the specificity and sensitivity were 74% and 88%, respectively. Conclusion(s): INH-A and AMH can be used as new biomarkers for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents, while INSL3 has no diagnostic value in this regard.Copyright © 2021, Galenos Publishing House.

N2  - Objective: The objective of the study is to investigate sleep disorders in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and determine the relationship of sleep disorders with the metabolic and psychogenic aspects of PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): This case-control study was conducted between October 1, 2019, and March 1, 2020, at the gynaecology and neurology outpatient clinics of a tertiary hospital. The study included 73 patients diagnosed with PCOS and 63 healthy women volunteers. Testosterone, fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels of all the participants were measured. All study participants completed Beck's depression inventory (BDI), Beck's anxiety inventory (BAI), Epworth Sleepiness scale (ESS), Berlin questionnaire (BQ), insomnia severity index (ISI), and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). The presence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) was assessed according to the international RLS study group criteria. Result(s): According to PSQI scores, 61.6% of patients with PCOS and 34.9% of healthy controls had a poor sleep quality (p=0.003). The PCOS group had significantly higher PSQI, ESS, ISI, BAI, BDI, and BQ scores than the control group (p=0.002, p=0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). Although 23.3% of patients with PCOS met the RLS criteria, this rate was only 6.3% in the control group (p=0.013). There was a positive correlation between insulin resistance and PSQI (r=0.320, p=0.006). Conclusion(s): This study's results indicate that PCOS may be a risk factor for several sleep disorders. In addition, the cumulative impact of both the organic and psychogenic changes caused by PCOS may lead to sleep disorders.©Copyright 2021 by Turkish Sleep Medicine Society.

N2  - Background: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate sexual and marital satisfaction in couples with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A case-control study was conducted on 90 couples with PCOS and 90 healthy couples as a control group. Three measures were used to evaluate sexual function and marital satisfaction: the female sexual function index (FSFI), the Larson sexual satisfaction, and the ENRICH marital satisfaction measures. Result(s): The results of this study show that the mean scores of sexual function, sexual satisfaction, and marital satisfaction were significantly lower in PCOS couples compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Infertility was reported as the strongest predictive factor for sexual function and marital satisfaction in couples with PCOS (P < 0.05). Compared to the control group, sexual and marital satisfaction was lower in patients with PCOS and their partners. Conclusion(s): Since infertility is the strongest predictive factor for the sexual health of couples with PCOS and sexual health is important in family health and marital life, sexual counseling may prove beneficial for these patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive disorder with prevalence of 5-10% in premenopausal women, which is identified with hyperandrogenism and ovarian dysfunction. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of fennel supplementation with energy-restricted diets on body fat and muscle percentage and insulin resistance in women with PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-four overweight/obese women with PCOS were randomly allocated to 4 groups for 12 wk as follows: (1) standard diet + fennel (SDF), (2) high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet supplemented with fennel (HPF), (3) standard diet + placebo (SDP), and (4) high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet + placebo (HPP). Result(s): After 12 wk of intervention, there were significant changes in the percentage of body fat and muscle in all groups. Decreasing in fasting insulin was -4.12 m IU/ml (p = 0.01) or HPF n -4.5 m IU/ml (p = 0.03) for SDP groups. In addition, HOMA-IR significantly decreased in HPF (p = 0.02) and SDP (p = 0.02) groups. Conclusion(s): Energy-restricted diets independent of dietary composition improved the body fat and muscle percentage and insulin resistance indices in women with PCOS. High-protein diet and fennel compared with standard diet and placebo had no significant effect on insulin resistance, body fat and muscle.

A1  - Salman A.D. 
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common ovary disorder characterize by complex of health problems that affects women of reproductive age due to hormonal imbalance and metabolic problems, so nurses have an important role in providing counseling and health education for women in reproductive age. Objective(s): To assess nurses knowledge about Polycystic ovary syndrome. Methodology: A descriptive study was conducted on probability sample (systematic random) of (100) nurses and midwife who work in obstetric and gynecological departments from three hospitals at Baghdad City: AL-Karkh maternity Hospital, Al-Elwia Maternity Teaching Hospital and Baghdad Teaching Hospital. Study implemented for the period of February 24th 2015 to April 25th 2015. A questionnaire was used as a tool of data collection to fulfill with objective of the study and consisted of three parts, including demographic characteristics, personal experience with polycystic ovary syndrome, sources of knowledge regarding polycystic ovary syndrome and knowledge regarding polycystic ovary syndrome. A pilot study was carried out to test the reliability of the questionnaire and content validity was carried out through the 17 experts. Descriptive statistical analyses were used to analyze the data. Result(s): In general the results of the study revealed that half of nurses were at age group (30-39) years, (35%) of study sample was Institute of medical technology/nursing, half of study sample work at obstetric and gynecological ward, (55%) of study sample were married and the highest percentage (93%) their sources of knowledge about Polycystic ovary syndrome from syllabus. Most of the study sample had high assessment level of knowledge about polycystic ovary syndrome. Conclusion(s): Nurses had high level of knowledge regarding the polycystic ovary syndrome, the reason for this is due to nursing curriculum was effective in giving scientific knowledge about it.Copyright © 2020, Institute of Medico-Legal Publications.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Hirsutism is a distressing medical problem for women. Most of hirsutism in women is associated with excess androgen, and most cases have PCOS as an underlying cause.Which androgen to be used to evaluate clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS is still debated. There are a small number of studies that evaluated androgens in women with PCOS having hirsutism with conflicting results. The Objective of this study was to determine which androgen predict hirsutism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A case-control study was done in Faiha Specialized Diabetes, Endocrine, and Metabolism Center (FDEMC), Basrah, Iraq. A total of 130 women with PCOS (based on Rotterdam criteria) and 70 healthy controls of comparable age (16-40 years) were investigated for androgens (total testosterone, free testosterone, DHEA-S) using Electrochemiluminescence technology assay; excess hair was examined according to the modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) score and a cut-off value of 8 defined hirsutism. In the three groups of women, the first (n=100) included PCOS with hirsutism, the second (n=30) PCOS without hirsutism, and the third (n=70) women without PCOS or hirsutism as healthy control, hirsutism was seen in about 77 % of PCOS women mostly of moderate severity; High TT, FT, DHEA-S, and overall androgens were seen in 69%, 76%, 37%, and 99% respectively of our PCOS women with hirsutism. No correlation was found between TT, FT, and DHEA-S and the mFG score. This study provides evidence that presence of hirsutism in women with PCOS was associated with a higher level of biochemical hyperandrogenism than seen in PCOS without hirsutism; however, there was no correlation between the studied androgens and mFG score.Copyright © 2020 This is an Open Access article licensed under a Creative Commons license: Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY).

N2  - Data on eating disorders in women with PCOS is insufficient. The objective of this case study was to examine the hypothesis that women with PCOS exhibit more impaired eating than healthy women. Women diagnosed with PCOS under the 2003 Rotterdam Diagnostic Criteria (n = 40) were compared with a healthy control group (n = 40). The groups also were divided into two as normal body weight and overweight/obese. The Eating Disorders Assessment Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R21), were completed by all participants in order to evaluate eating behaviors in addition to eating disorders. Among the overweight/obese group, the average total and subscale scores of the EDE-Q as well as the total and sub-factor scores of the TFEQ-R21 were higher in women with PCOS compared to controls (p <.05). However, this statistically significant result was not shown among the women with normal weight (p >.05). In comparison to the controls, the PCOS women displayed higher values of the tool scores indicating abnormal restraint eating, body shape concern and weight concern subscale scores (p <.05). This result suggests that the evaluation of eating disorders should be added to routine screening and the monitoring of women with PCOS.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Objective: The aim of our study was to compare the BMI and metabolic values of fertile and infertile groups in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to determine the effect of obesity and metabolic status on fertility and infertile groups and the fertility effect of obesity. Material(s) and Method(s): The clinical and metabolic data of 230 patients who presented to the gynecology outpatient clinic of our hospital between 2013 and 2018 and were diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam Diagnosis Criteria were evaluated. Body mass index (BMI), waist ratio, menstrual period, fertility status, fertility duration, parity status, presence and degree of hirsutism were evaluated. 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed following appropriate diet and fasting period. Fasting glucose and insulin levels and insulin resistance cases were determined. Total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol levels were determined. Patients with BMI; The patients were divided into two groups as fertile and infertile, evaluated for obesity and metabolic data, and data on the relationship with BMI were calculated statistically. These metabolic disorders were compared to BMI and fertility status. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 26.7 years. The mean BMI was 28.92 +/- 5.95 kg / m2. Only 25% of the patients had normal weight and 73% were overweight. 4 (1.7%) cases in the weak group with BMI less than 18.5, 58 (25.2%) cases in normal weight group with BMI 19-24.9, 71 (30.9%) in overweight group with BMI 25-29.9 There were 86 cases (37.4%) in obese group with BMI 30-39.9 and 11 cases (4.8%) in morbidly obese group with BMI of 40 and above. u (21.5%) is fertile. The duration of infertility ranged from 12 to 196 months, with a mean of 33.92 +/- 24.25 months and a median of 24 months. The waist circumference is between 62 and 135 cm and the average is 87.76 +/- 13.48 cm. The waist / hip ratio ranged from 0.65 to 0.98 and the mean was 0.80 +/- 0.06. The distribution of BMI was similar in the fertile and infertile groups. 99 (43.1%) of the patients had insulin resistance, 77 (33.5%) had impaired glucose tolerance and 12 (5.2%) had DM. Mean blood lipid levels were not significantly different between fertile and infertile groups. The distribution of glucose metabolism disorders was similar in both groups. Conclusion(s): Obesity and metabolic disorders are more common in PCOS cases. There was no significant difference between fertile and infertile groups according to BMI.Copyright © 2019 Zeynep Kamil Kadin ve Cocuk Hastaliklari Egitim ve Arastirma Hastanesi. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we aimed to compare temperament and character traits between patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and age-body mass index-matched healthy controls (HC). We hypothesized that patient with PCOS would differ in terms of temperament and character traits compared with HCs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients who were diagnosed with PCOS and 42 age-body mass index-matched healthy controls (HC) were included in the study. The groups were compared in terms of temperament and character traits and anxiety status with the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-1 and STAI-2). FINDINGS: There was a statistically significant difference between patient and the control group in terms of cooperativeness dimension (t = -2.81; p = 0.006). It was a lower mean in the PCOS group (20.98 +/- 2.992). In addition, scores of STAI-1 and STAI-2 were significantly higher in the PCOS group compared with the HC group (respectively; t = 5.70; p < 0.001; t = 2.12; p = 0.037). The score of cooperativeness and multivariate analysis of variance was found to be significantly lower in the PCOS group. CONCLUSION(S): Patients with PCOS had significant a different character trait such as lower cooperativeness compared with HC. Additionally, we found that this different character dimension would be a trait in PCOS after covariant analysis. We suggest that our result supported the psychiatric background of PCOS.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a lifestyle disorder known to cause profound distress in the physical and emotional well-being of the patient that implicates the need for treatment and lifestyle management. Unawareness and ignorance among patients may be a predominant cause of compromised quality of life (QOL) that necessitates education from health-care professionals. The existing study was designed to assess the impact of counseling on QOL in the above patients. Method(s): This hospital-based interventional study was carried out for 6 months. A total of 173 subjects were recruited for the study. The World Health Organization BREF, a validated, reliable tool to assess QOL was administered in two phases of the study, pre-interventional, and post-interventional phase. Awareness regarding disease and lifestyle modification were detailed by a clinical pharmacist to the patients, and its impact was assessed using suitable statistical techniques. Result(s): The average age of study participants was 23.9+/-4.5 years. Decreased QOL was observed in the women affected with PCOS when compared to healthy controls, wherein the psychological domain was the most affected. Post-intervention, a positive impact was reflected as higher scores in all the 4 QOL domains. Conclusion(s): Women suffering from PCOS exhibit varied symptoms which affect both physical and psychological health. The key factor in management is to create awareness on the complications of the disease and the lifestyle modification to minimize severity and progression. The study findings reveal that women with PCOS showed an improved QOL post participation in awareness programs imparted by the clinical pharmacists.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Objectives: to compare the serum AMH levels in PCOS & normo-ovulatory women and investigate correlation between clinical, hormonal, ultrasonographic parameters and AMH levels in both groups. Method(s): a comparative cross-sectional study was performed in sixty-four women (32-PCOS based on Rotterdam consensus; 32 normo-ovulatory-matched controls investigated for male, tubal or unexplained infertility). Serum LH, FSH, androstenedione, fastinginsulin and AMH were measured in early phase (day 3-4) of natural menstrual cycle or progestin-induced withdrawal bleeding (in PCOS). Transvaginal USG performed for calculation of small sized ovarian follicles (<10 mm). Result(s): AMH levels were significantly higher in patients of PCOS group as compared to control group (ROC curve; Cut off >3.6; Sensitivity-78.12% & Specificity-87.50%). AMH was positively correlated with LH, LH/FSH, androstenedione and number of small follicles in PCOS group while in control group with number of small follicles only. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that number of small follicles has only determinant for AMH level (r =0.509; P < 0.005). Conclusion(s): number of small sized ovarian follicles has strong association with AMH level in PCOS patients, possibly lead to increased androgen levels. So AMH could be helpful in planning and management for ovulation induction therapy in PCOS patients.Copyright © 2018, Partner-Graf srl, Prato.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is thought to be the most well-known endocrine issue in ladies of regenerative age manifested with various metabolic disturbances and a wide spectrum of clinical features such as menstrual abnormalities, obesity, and hyperandrogenism. This study was aimed to measure the association between HbA1c and body mass index (BMI) in PCOS women. This study was performed in AL-Batool hospital for obstetric and gynecological diseases in Ba'quba city/ Iraq May 2017 to January 2018. It includes 42 patients with PCOS aging from 20-37 years and 42 healthy control. Fasting venous blood samples were obtained for analysis of fasting blood glucose (FBG), hemoglobin (Hb) and HbA1c. BMI was calculated for all study participants by the present weight in Kg dividing by the square of height in meters. This study involved 42 cases of PCOS (case group) and other 42 participants were free of disease (control group). The mean age among patients of case group was significantly higher than that in control group (26.95 +/- 4.77 versus 23.9 +/- 2.71, P=0.015). 90.5% of patients in control group had normal BMI level while 42.9% of patients in the case group were class I obese. Mean of BMI among patients of case group was significantly higher than that of the control group (29.84 +/- 4.22 versus 22.8 +/- 2.02, P=0.001). According to HbA1c level, all patients in control group and 90.5% of patients in the case group were non-diabetic. The mean of HbA1c among patients of case group was significantly higher than that in control group (4.76 +/- 0.88 versus 3.9 +/- 0.6, P=0.001). In the present study, it was found that there is a significant positive correlation between HbA1c and BMI (r= 0.567, P= 0.001). BMI is positively correlated with HbA1c and associated with glycemic control in PCOS.Copyright © 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved.

T1  - Tabooed disease in alienated bodies: A study of women suffering from Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
A1  - Sharma S.
A1  - Mishra A.J. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Objectives: To study socio-cultural impact of PCOS on Indian Women especially those belonging to Economically Weaker Section (EWS). Methodology: It is a field work based study in which females suffering from PCOS were interviewed in the Outpatient Department (OPD) of a Government Hospital in Jammu. Majority of the respondents belonged to EWS and did not know anything about PCOS. Semi-structured interview schedule was used to interview patients who visited OPD for the treatment. Entire data were collected from 15th November 2016 to 31st December 2016. Information provided by respondents is used as narratives in the present study. Theories of stigma and social construction of illness have been used to analyse respondents' approach towards the disease and the way they perceive the onset of PCOS. Results and discussions: Entire discussion part has been sub-divided into: PCOS as a tabooed disease; infertility: a major consequence of PCOS; Lack of awareness about the disease; and social construction of PCOS. Respondents are found to have a grave concern about the disease due to their inability to adhere to the socially constructed role of a woman. Since, menstruation is still a tabooed topic of discussion in many parts of Indian society, hence they abstain from discussing about irregularity of periods till situation goes out of hand. Married women are marred by the stigma of infertility and unmarried ones fear future infertility. Conclusion(s): Lack of awareness and compulsion to fulfil socially expected role of a woman, women suffering from PCOS, in this part of India, aim only at becoming pregnant (in case of married women) and normalising their monthly periods (in case of unmarried females). However, there is need to spread awareness about PCOS and encouraging women to adopt knowledge, attitude and practice approach to manage this disease.Copyright © 2017

N2  - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a lifestyle disorder known to cause profound distress in physical and emotional wellbeing. Unawareness and ignorance among patients may be a predominant cause of compromised quality of life (QOL) that necessitates education from health care professionals. Existing study was designed to assess the impact of counselling on QOLin the above patients at a tertiary care hospital. This hospital based interventional study was carried out for a period of 6 months. A total of 83 subjects diagnosed with PCOSwere compared with 89 healthy women, recruited from the out-patient department of Endocrinology. WHO-BREF, a validated, reliabletool to assess QOLwas administered in two phases of the study, pre-interventional and post interventional period. The average age of women in study and control group were observed to be 25.54+/-5.18 and 22.41+/-3.07 y respectively. Decreased QOL was observedin the women affected with PCOSwhencompared to healthy controls, wherein the psychological domain was the most affected. Post theintervention, a positive impact was reflected as higher scores in all the four domains such as Physical Health (Domain 1): 58.45+/-8.79; Psychological (Domain 2): 53.457+/-10.71; Social Relationships (Domain 3): 58.060+/-13.51; Environment (Domain 4):57.34+/-9.80). The key factor in management is to create awareness on the complications of the disease and the life style modification to minimize severity and progression. The study findings reveal that womenwith PCOSshowed animproved QOL post participation in awareness programs imparted by the clinical pharmacists.

N2  - Background: Adherence issues in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients have not been examined thoroughly. Patients report prolonged periods of treatment and side effects of the drug as the most common reason for withdrawal from treatment. To improve the effective management of PCOS patients, it is fundamental to understand facilitating and inhibiting factors to treatment adherence. Objective(s): To explore facilitating/inhibiting factors related to treatment adherence among PCOS patients. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a qualitative study with a purposive sample of women with confirmed diagnosis of PCOS. The data were collected via 20 in-depth semi-structured interviews with women aged between 21-34 yr. A qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the data. Result(s): Five themes were identified which described different types of facilitating/ inhibiting factors to treatment adherence. Inhibiting factors included financial issues, patient-related, disease-related, and health care provider-related factors; while social factors were found to be both facilitating and inhibiting. Conclusion(s): The findings suggest that successful adherence to PCOS treatment is highly dependent on patients recognizing and adapting to financial, social, and health care related inhibiting factors. It is also crucial for clinicians and policy makers to recognize these key inhibiting factors in order to improve treatment outcomes.Copyright © 2017, Research and Clinical Center for Infertitlity.

N2  - Study objective Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common multifaceted disorder found among females of the reproductive age presenting major clinical conditions of hirsutism, oligomenorrhea and infertility. Socioeconomic studies from India have observed PCOS as a lifestyle disorder highly prevalent among middle and high income urban population as compared to rural population. A large ethnographic study that identifies the prevalence of PCOS among different socioeconomic groups would be greatly helpful to reiterate women about lifestyle modifications. Design Cross - sectional survey study. Setting Random from the general population. Materials and methods A survey was taken up by 502 young women (between 18 and 24 years) from Chennai and collectively 566 girls from Thiruvallur and Dindugal districts to represent urban and rural population respectively. The responses were entered into an excel workbook and were analyzed statistically for correlation of influencing parameters and manifestation of the disorder. Main outcome measures From our survey, we have identified a PCOS prevalence rate of 6% in south India, according to the Rotterdam criteria. We have observed that the odds of urban women prone to acquiring PCOS are 0.1 times higher than women in rural India. Major conclusions Family history was found to have a strong association in incidence and manifestation of the disorder. Stress was found to set off the symptoms pertaining to PCOS. We also noticed that the awareness, among the rural population especially, was very minimum and thus they were not oblivious of diagnosis.Copyright © 2017 Middle East Fertility Society

N2  - Aims To evaluate the efficacy of exenatide on weight loss, insulin resistance, menstrual periods, metabolic profiles, inflammatory markers, and safety compared with metformin in Chinese overweight/obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. Methods Eighty-two overweight/obese (OW/OB) patients with PCOS were randomly assigned to the exenatide group (10 mug BID sc, n = 41) or metformin group (1000 mg BID po, n = 41) for 12 weeks. The main primary outcomes was mean change in body weight. Results Sixty-three patients completed the study (31 cases in the EXE group and 32 cases in the MET group). EXE treatment was superior to MET treatment in weight loss (P = 0.009), with EXE leading to a significant mean loss of 3.1 +/- 0.2 kg (P < 0.001) and MET leading to a significant mean loss of 1.2 +/- 0.3 kg (P < 0.001). There was a significantly greater effect of EXE compared to metformin with respect to 2hINS, HOMA-IR, INSAUC and ISI (P < 0.001, P = 0.004, P < 0.001, P < 0.021, respectively), with both treatments leading to significant decreases in 2hINS, HOMA-IR and INSAUC (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively); and a significant increase in ISI (P < 0.001). FAI decreased while SHBG increased significantly with both treatments (P = 0.022, P < 0.001, respectively) with no significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05). EXE treatment was superior to MET treatment in reducing hsCRP (P = 0.016) with both treatments leading to a significant increase (P < 0.001). Menstrual periods, mFG score and Rosenfield score were not significantly different before and after treatment for either group (P > 0.05). Conclusions Short-term exenatide treatment possesses a greater efficacy in terms of weight loss, improving insulin resistance and reducing inflammation than metformin. Large-sample and long-term clinical trials, however, are needed to assess exenatide's efficacy and safety in OW/OB women with PCOS.Copyright © 2017

N2  - Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the effect of insulin sensitizers i.e. metformin and myoinositol on anthropometric parameters in patients of the Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): A prospective, open-labeled, randomized, comparative, clinical study was conducted on 60 patients. The patients were randomly divided into two groups of 30 each to receive either of the following two treatments: group A: Tablet myoinositol 1g twice daily. group B: Tablet metformin 500 mg thrice daily for 24 w. Anthropometric parameters were assessed by measuring body weight, Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR) at baseline and subsequently at the end of 12 w and 24 w. Result(s): In both the groups, there was a statistically significant improvement in over a period of 24 w. In group A, the values for weight at baseline, 12 w and 24 w expressed in mean+/-SEM are 63.96+/-.90, 62.33+/-.88 and 61.20+/-.85 while in group B the values were 63.58+/-1.88, 62.26+/-1.74 and 60.86+/-1.65. In group A, the values for BMI at baseline, 12 w and 24 w were 26.45+/-.41, 25.78+/-.42 and 25.31+/-.40 while in group B the values were 26.09+/-.76, 25.53+/-.71 and 24.96+/-.68 respectively. In group A, WHR values were 0.79+/-.007, 0.78+/-.007 and 0.78+/-.007 while in group B 0.79+/-.010, 0.79+/-0.108, 0.79+/-.011 at baseline, 12 w and 24 w respectively. However, on comparing both the groups at 12 and 24 w, no statistically significant difference was observed in all the parameters. Conclusion(s): There was a definite improvement in anthropometric parameters with both metformin and myoinositol but on comparing these drugs, no significant difference was observed. Thus, myoinositol can also be used as an alternative to metformin for the treatment of PCOS.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Women with PCOS are at increased risk of anxiety and depression, but there is limited data on the prevalence of eating disorders (ED) in this population. The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of ED in women with PCOS and associated risk factors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. MATERIALSANDMETHODS: Women with PCOS (Rotterdam Criteria; n=121) were recruited from an academic PCOS Center. Control subjects (n=57) had regular menses and no hirsutism and were receiving routine gynecologic care in the same time period. Both groups completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDEQ), Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). >=4 was clinically significant on the EDEQ, >= 25 on NEQ, and >= 11 on HADS. The PCOS group also completed the PCOS Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (PCOSQ). Fisher exact and two-tailed t tests were used for descriptive statistics. Multivariate logistic regression was used to control for confounders. RESULT(S): PCOS subjects were younger with a higher mean BMI compared to controls (Table). Global and all individual EDEQ scores were significantly higher in PCOS subjects compared to controls. EDEQ Global Score inversely correlated with overall PCOSQ score (r=-0.57, p=0.001) and with all PCOSQ domains, particularly emotion (r= -0.51, p<0.001) and weight (r= -0.79, p<0.0001). Women with PCOS had an increased odds of abnormal EDEQ Global Score >= 4 (OR=6.87, 95% CI 0.88- 53.86, p=0.04) however, the age and BMI-adjusted OR was 5.78 (CI 0.60-55.4, p<0.13). As expected, more women with PCOS had abnormal anxiety (41.7 vs 14%, p<0.001) and depressive scores (13.2 v. 3.5%, p=0.06) compared to controls. Among PCOS patients with anxiety, the odds ratio of EDEQ >= 4 was 9.70, 95%CI: 2.0, 46.1, p=0.004 compared to those without anxiety. This association increased after controlling for age and BMI (AOR 19.6, 95%CI 2.4-158.7, p=0.005). PCOS women with depression also had a greater odds of EDEQ >= 4 (OR: 3.84, 95%CI: 1.0- 14.6, p=0.048; age and BMI AOR: 3.96, 95%CI 1.0-15.6, p=0.049). The prevalences of bulimia, binge eating disorder, and night eating disorder in PCOS subjects were higher than in controls, but the differences were not statistically significant (Table). CONCLUSION(S): Our study demonstrates a significant increase in disordered eating attitudes and behaviors associated with decreased quality of life in women with PCOS. Further, it highlights the need to screen for eating disorders especially in women with PCOS and co-existing anxiety or depressive symptoms. (Table Presented).

N2  - Design Prospective cross sectional study., Main outcome measures: plasma concentration of adipocytokines, insulin resistance/hyperinsulinism (IR/HI), lipid profile, androgens and obstetric outcome., Objective To estimate the effects of adipocytokines on the metabolic and endocrine features, and the obstetric outcome in pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)., Materials and methods The study included hundred pregnant PCOS (PPCOS) women with android obesity (group 1), 100 pregnant non-PCOS women with android obesity (group 2), 100 PPCOS women with gynoid obesity (group 3), and 100 pregnant non-PCOS women with gynoid obesity (group 4). All patients in the four groups were primigravidae and women with PCOS (groups 1 and 3) became pregnant after treatment with clomiphene citrate and/or gonadotropins. Plasma concentrations of fasting glucose, fasting serum insulin, insulin sensitivity by quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), serum concentrations of triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol, (HDL-c), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c); plasma adipocytokines: interleukin (IL)-10, adiponectin (both are insulin sensitizers and anti-inflammatory), pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-6, prothrombin activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); serum total testosterone (TT), sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), free androgen index (FAI) were estimated for the four groups between 22 and 24 weeks' gestation Glucose loading test was done at 22-24 weeks' gestation to check for gestational diabetes mellitus and if normal it was repeated at 30-34 weeks. Gestational hypertension (GH), preeclampsia (PE) and preterm labor (PTL) (delivery <37 weeks' gestation) were recorded., Results Groups 1 and 2 with android obesity had IR/HI, (QUICKI < 0.331 +/- 0.010). Groups 3 and 4 with gynoid obesity had normal insulin sensitivity (NIS), (QUICKI > 0.331 +/- 0.010). Serum concentration of TGs, LDL-c, and plasma concentration of IL-6, PAI-1, hsCRP were significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 than groups 3 and 4. Serum HDL-c, plasma IL-10 and adiponectin were significantly higher in groups 3 and 4 than groups 1 and 2. Serum TT and FAI were significantly higher in groups 1 and 3 (cases of PPCOS) than their controls. There was no significant difference in the serum concentration of TC between the four groups. Incidence of spontaneous early miscarriage (SM) in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 36%, 12%, 33%, and 11% respectively. Incidence of SM was significantly higher in PPCOS than non-PCOS pregnancy irrespective of the type of obesity. Rate of late pregnancy complications, GDM, GH, PE and PTL was significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 with android obesity than groups 3 and 4 with gynoid obesity. There was no significant difference in the rates of cesarean section (CS) between the 4 groups. The rates of neonatal complications and perinatal mortality were significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 (android obesity) than groups 3 and 4 (gynoid obesity)., Conclusion TT and FAI were significantly higher in PPCOS with android obesity than PPCOS with gynoid obesity.Incidence of early SM (9-12 weeks) was significantly higher in PPCOS than in non-PCOS pregnancy irrespective of the type of obesity.Incidence of late-onset pregnancy complications, GDM, GH, PE and PTL was significantly higher in patients with android obesity than patients with gynoid obesity. PCOS per se seemed to be not related to the incidence of late-onset pregnancy complications.Pregnant patients with android obesity, (both PCOS and non-PCOS) with diminished serum concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and increased serum concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines had IR/HI and dyslipidemia. Pregnant patients with gynoid obesity, (both PCOS and non-PCOS) with normal serum concentration of anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines had NIS and normal lipid profile.In pregnancy with android obesity patients had reduced plasma concentration of IL-10 and increased concentration of IL-6 which may impair the development of the placenta with increased risk of PTL.Neonatal complications and perinatal mortality were significantly higher in PPCOS with android obesity than PPCOS with gynoid obesity.Copyright © 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Follicular fluid antimullerian hormone (AMH) does not predict IVF outcomes in polycystic ovary syndrome patients
A1  - Abu-Fakher B.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Introduction: AMH, is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) produced by granulosa cells with the highest expression being in small antral follicles. Our objective is to evaluate the predictive value of follicular AMH levels as an indicator of IVF outcomes in PCOS patients. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 63 patients undergoing the IVF trail were recruited for this prospective case-control study. The patients were classified into three groups: Group I: 43 patients with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Group II: 20 normo-ovulatory patients were recruited for the IVF trail because of the male infertility factor (control group). Group III: consists of 33 patients from group I recruited to determine the effect of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) on serum AMH levels. Serum AMH levels were performed on day 3 of the menstrual cycle whereas the follicular fluid AMH level has been evaluated at the time of oocyte retrieval by enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay (AMH Gen II ELISA kit, Beckman Coulter, Inc. USA). AMH concentrations were adjusted to its protein content, to avoid possible bias due to FF volume variability. The relationship between follicular fluid AMH (FF AMH) levels and the number of oocytes retrieved, number of mature oocytes, number of embryos, fertilization and clinical pregnancy rate were assessed. The demographic data were similar between two groups as regards age and BMI. Result(s): Both serum AMH levels and FF AMH levels were significantly higher in PCOS patients than in the controls, the values for serum levels were (5.07 +/- 3.39 ng/ml, 3.07 +/- 2.09 ng/ml) respectively and for follicular fluid levels were (67 +/- 50.7 ng/g, 38.5 +/- 44.4 ng/g) respectively. Serum AMH levels showed a positive correlation with oocytes retrieved and mature oocyte number, but there was no significant correlation with good quality embryo number, fertilization rate or clinical pregnancy rate in PCOS patients. On the other hand FF AMH levels do not show correlation with any of the IVF outcomes mentioned above in PCOS patients. Interestingly, the interval change in serum AMH levels between baseline AMH levels and levels after COH had a significant predictive value of pregnancy. Conclusion(s): Serum AMH levels can predict the number of the retrieved oocytes and mature oocytes, whereas FF AMH may not be a valuable predictor for IVF outcomes in PCOS patients. © 2013 Middle East Fertility Society.Production and hosting by Elsevier B.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Binge eating disorder(BED) is a newly established DSM V diagnosis present in 3.5 % of women and up to 30% of patients pursuing treatment for weight loss. This has not previously been assessed in infertility or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. We hypothesize a higher prevalence of BED in obese PCOS patients given the association of obesity with PCOS. DESIGN: Questionnaire-based observational study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An IRB approved 8 question survey utilizing DSM diagnostic criteria for BED designed to identify characteristic patterns of eating was administered to 3 groups of patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF): obese PCOS (BMI >30 kg/m2; n=6), lean PCOS (BMI<25 kg/m2; n=5), and controls (oocyte donors or male factor infertility (n=10). PCOS was diagnosed by Rotterdam criteria and BED was diagnosed by DSM criteria. Survey results were analyzed using one way ANOVAwith Tukey post hoc analysis. Demographic data was reported as mean+/- standard deviation. Significance was defined as p <0.05. RESULT(S): The mean age of patients was 29.7 +/- 3.0. The average BMI was 28.0 +/- 7.5. Average gravidity was 1.0+/-1.0. None of the patients were diagnosed with BED. However, the obese PCOS group was significantly more likely to response yes to 2 of 8 questions which were associated with eating when not hungry (p<0.01), and self- degradating emotions after over eating (p<0.01), compared to both lean PCOS and controls. CONCLUSION(S): While none of the patients in our study were diagnosed with BED, the greater number of positive responses among obese PCOS patients illustrates how eating without hunger can lead to emotional issues and poor self image that continues the overeating cycle. Further studies in obese PCO vs obese cycling patients need to be undertaken.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is defined by hyperan- drogenism (HA) and ovarian dysfunction, but is also characterised by insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic anomalies. The aim of this study was to verify whether metabolic and endocrine perturbations develop early in girls genetically linked to PCOS. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 9 girls aged 8-14 years having a relative (mother or sister) diagnosed with PCOS (PCOSr) and 10 girls of similar age with no PCOS relative. Anthropometry and pubertal stage (Tanner) were assessed. A 2h oral glucose tolerance test and a 3h frequently sampled intra-venous glucose tolerance test (FSivGTT) were performed to determine insulin sensitivity (IS). Androgens and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were assayed. Insulin-induced NEFA suppression (NEFAsupp) was estimated by the negative slope of decreasing NEFA levels (on log scale) during the first 20 min of FSivGTT. Groups were compared with Wilcoxon tests and correlations were verified by Spearman tests. Adjustments were made by ANCOVA, using log-transformed variables when required. RESULT(S): In comparison to controls, PCOSr had higher body mass index (BMI) (P<0.05) and decreased IS (P=0.003). Levels of the androgen 17OH- progesterone (17Pg) were increased in PCOSr (P=0.03), independently of adiposity (Ps>=0.05) or Tanner stage (>=2vs >2), but not of IS. Indeed, 17Pg was strongly correlated with IS (P=0.0003) even after correction for Tanner stage (P=0.0007). Finally, NEFAsupp was decreased in PCOSr(P=0.004) as compared to controls, independently of Tanner stage (P=0.02), adiposity (Ps>=0.01), 17Pg (P=0.05) or BMI & 17Pg (P=0.05). NEFAsupp was correlated with IS (P=0.02). CONCLUSION(S): Girls at high risk of developing PCOS presents elevated adiposity, IR and HA, but are mainly characterized by resistance to insulin-induced lipolysis, independently of adiposity. We thus report the first evidence that genetic predisposition to PCOS may be related to early adipocyte dysfunction.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Objectives: To assess the value of uterine artery Doppler screening during pregnancy in predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): A prospective case control study. Setting(s): Obstetrics and Gynecology and Medical Biochemistry departments, Zagazig University Hospital, Egypt. Method(s): Forty pregnant women with ovulatory PCOS (PCOS group) and 40 age- and body mass index-matched healthy pregnant controls (control group) underwent serial Doppler velocimetry measurements of the uterine artery, measurements of free androgen index and fasting glucose/insulin ratio during first and late second trimesters. Main Outcome Measure(s): Blood flow impedance indices, free androgen index, fasting glucose/insulin ratio and pregnancy outcomes. Student's t-test, chi2-test, and specificity and sensitivity tests were used for statistical analysis of the data. Result(s): Patients with PCOS had a significantly higher level of testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, free androgen index, fasting glucose/fasting insulin level in the first and late second trimesters (P <= 0.05). A significantly (P < 0.05) higher PI value was observed in the PCOS group than in the control group in the first and late second trimesters. At 26 weeks of gestation 27.2% of pregnant patients with PCOS had a notch on either side, comparing with 12.8% of the control group. The rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes was significantly higher in pregnant patients with PCOS 45% versus 10% in the control group. Conclusion(s): Uterine artery Doppler indices have a higher predictive value for abnormal pregnancy outcomes in pregnant patients with PCOS. © 2011 Middle East Fertility Society.

N2  - Objectives: Polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS is one of the most common reproductive abnormalities and is characterized by hyperandrogenemia. We aimed to assess the frequency of fibromyalgia syndrome FMS and psychological distress in patients with PCOS. Method(s): Forty patients with PCOS and 39 age-matched healthy controls were included in the study as PCOS and healthy normal control HNC groups. The diagnosis of FMS was based on the American College of Rheumatology criteria of 1990, and the diagnosis of PCOS was based on the Rotterdam criteria of 2003. All participants completed the questionnaires to gather information including demographic features, FMS-related symptoms, and the psychological status. Patients with PCOS were divided into two subgroups according to coexistence of FMS PCOS only and PCOS FMS. Result(s): The mean age of PCOS and HNC groups were 23.97 +/- 6.01 and 26.15 +/- 5.45 years, respectively P > 0.05. The frequency of FMS in PCOS and HNC groups was 32.5 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively P < 0.05. Except constipation and paresthesia, the presence of FMS-related symptoms in the PCOS FMS subgroup were higher than those of the PCOS only subgroup and HNC group. There were no differences in depression scores between the PCOS only and PCOS FMS subgroups, but there were differences in anxiety scores. Conclusion(s): The frequency of FMS was found to be increased in PCOS. Anxiety risk was also found to be increased, particularly in patients with PCOS and concomitant FMS. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of oral contraceptive on the serum free prostatic specific antigen (PSA) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOD) compared with cyproterone compound. Material(s) and Method(s): In this randomized clinical trial, 60 hirsute PCOD patients that referred to Imam Hossein hospital were enrolled. Baseline Ferriman-Gallway score (FG), body mass index (BMI), free PSA, 17-hydroxy progesterone (17-OHP), free testosterone, and dehydroepiandre-standione sulfate (DHEAS) were measured. Then patients were divided randomly into two groups. One group received oral contraceptive pill (OCP) and the other one ate cyproterone compound (Diane). Hormonal profile and Ferriman-Gallway scores were evaluated again after 3 months. Result(s): Baseline FG score was 10.78 +/- 2.4 vs. 11.5 +/- 2.3 in OCP and cyproterone compound group, respectively. FG score was reduced after 3 months to 8.06 +/- 2.5 vs. 9.2 +/- 2.3, respectively (P value = 0.000). There was no significant difference in FG score reduction after the treatment between two groups (r > 0.05). Baseline PSA was 0.201 +/- 0.3 in OCP group and 0.097 +/- 0.12 ng/ml in cyproterone compound group and after the treatment was decreased in both groups significantly 0.135 +/- 0.24 vs. 0.059 +/- 0.05 ng/ml, respectively, but the mean reduction of score was the same for both groups (r > 0.5). Free testosterone reduced more in OCP group (2.48 +/- 1.3 ng/ ml to 2.24 +/- 1.0 ng/ml, P value=0.03) than cyproterone compound (2.00 +/- 1.2 to 1.64 +/- 0.9 ng/ ml, P value= 0.1). There was no statistical differences observed in 17-OHP and DHEAS after the treatment in both groups (P value >0.5). Conclusion(s): Serum free PSA and free testosterone and FG score were decreased after treatment with OCP and cyproterone compound but there was no preference between the two groups of anti-androgen treatment. © 2010 Middle East Fertility Society.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) was first introduced by Leventhal and Stein in 1935. It has a wide range of manifestations such as hyperandrogenism, irregular menstruation and central body obesity. The lack of definite diagnostic criteria has made the diagnosis a difficult task. Moreover, the disturbing aspects of the syndrome range from hirsutism in an adolescent girl to infertility in a young woman. Based on the Rotterdam 2003 Criteria, current diagnostic criteria must include two of the following three symptoms: 1. Either oligo-ovulation or anovulation, 2. Clinical or laboratory manifestations of hyperandrogenism, 3. Polycystic ovaries on sonographic examination (more than 12 follicles of less than 10 mm in diameter in each ovary). In this study, we have focused on the enrollment of a large sample size to assess the prevalence and clinical features of PCOS such that a wide range of basic information can be utilized for further investigations. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study with multi-stage random sampling. Subjects were selected from 15-18 years old girls from a number of high schools in Tehran. After interview and clinical examination, those individuals with either menstrual irregularities, hirsutism or obesity were referred for further laboratory evaluations and abdominal sonography in order to diagnose PCOS and estimate its prevalence. We also aimed to assess the predominant features of this disorder among adolescents. Result(s): The overall prevalence of the syndrome was 3.42%. Out of the 1430 girls, 49 were diagnosed with PCOS. Conclusion(s): Despite its high prevalence, this syndrome has not been widely studied. Most of the conducted studies have enrolled small samples within a short time period. Thus, more accurate policy making in this regard can be achieved through definition of the prevalence of PCOS and accurate estimation of its burden.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by anovulation, infertility, and hyperandrogenism. The present study aims to compare the clinical, biochemical, and hormonal changes in PCOS patients taking estradiol-cyproterone acetate (ECA), metformin (MET), and rosiglitazone (ROSI). METHOD(S): Ninety-four patients with PCOS were randomized according to the therapy they received as follows: MET 2 g/d group (n = 47), ROSI 4 mg/d group (n = 14), and 35 mug ethinyl estradiol-2 mg cyproterone acetate group (ECA) (n = 33). Complete hormonal assays, lipid profile, glucose, and insulin levels were studied over a 4-months period. RESULT(S): Patients randomized to the MET group lost more weight and had a greater reduction in BMI compared with baseline (P = 0.006 and P = 0.004). The reduction in triglyceride levels and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were statistically significant in the MET group while no changes were observed in the other groups. Regarding HDL levels, did not change in MET and ECA groups, but there was a significant increase compared with baseline in the ROSI group (P = 0.04). Mann-Whitney U test showed that the change (a tendency of reduction) was more significant in PCOS patients on MET for both total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (P < 0.001). The rate of improvement in oligomenorrhea was similar in all 3 treatments (P = 0.202). CONCLUSION(S): Our data show that in women with PCOS, ECA is more effective than insulin-sensitizing drugs such as rosiglitazone and metformin in improving menstrual pattern and reducing serum free-testosterone levels. MET, an insulin-sensitizing drug, is more effective in reducing fasting insulin levels than the ECA. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - To determine the effects of EE/CA (Ethinylestradiol/ Cyproterone Acetate) and EE/CA-metformin treatments on the asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels in women with PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome). Among 43 patients diagnosed with PCOS, one study arm (n=22) was administered (35 mug EE, 2mg CA) and the other (n=21) was administered (35 mug EE, 2mg CA plus 1700mg metformin). Serum ADMA, lipid profile, androgens, insulin, and HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance ) values were assessed prior to treatment and after 3 months of therapy. A significant reduction in ADMA levels relative to pre-treatment in the EE/CA+metformin group (1.2+/-0.4 vs 0.95+/-0.4, p=0.016) compared to the EE/CA group (1.0+/-0.5 vs 1.03+/-0.4, p >0.05). Andogens, insulin and HOMA-IR levels decreased in both treatment groups. All lipid profiles significantly improved in-group EE/CA+metformin while no significant decrease was observed in TG and HDL-cholesterol levels in EE/CA group. Post-treatment levels of HDL-C levels correlated significantly with the reducing ADMA levels in the EE/CA+metformin group (P=0.005, r= 0.602). Adding metformin to EE/CA therapy in PCOS may beneficial endothelium effects associated with reduction of ADMA levels. © 2009 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to assess the effects of metformin on menstrual frequency, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin resistance assessed as HOMA-index, weight, waist/hip ratio, blood pressure (BP), serum lipids, and testosterone levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)METHODSIn a randomized, controlled, double-blinded setup, 56 women aged 18-45 with PCOS were treated with either metformin 850 mg or placebo twice daily for 6 months. After a wash-out period of 3 months participants received the alternate treatment for 6 months. The changes in the measured parameters were analysed by intention-to-treat and per protocolRESULTSThere were no changes in menstrual frequency. In the intention-to-treat analysis, weight and systolic BP were reduced on metformin treatment (p=0.009 and 0.047, respectively), while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) increased (p=0.001). On placebo, weight and FPG increased (p<0.05). Post-hoc subgrouping according to BMI revealed reductions in testosterone (p=0.013), FPG (p=0.018), insulin (p=0.045) and HOMA-index (p=0.022) in obese women. Per protocol analysis showed the following differences between the changes on placebo and metformin (mean (5 - 95 % percentiles): weight (-4.2 (-7.0, -1.9) kg, p<0.001), FPG (-0.23 (-0.44, -0.01) mmol/l, p=0.041), insulin (-4.17 (-8.10, -0.23) mIU/l, p=0.039) and HOMA index (-1.50 (-2.53, -0.47) mIU/l*mmol/l, p=0.006). Weight, FPG and HOMA index were lower after metformin than after placebo. CONCLUSION(S): Metformin treatment lowered weight and systolic blood pressure and increased HDL in women with PCOS. In post-hoc analysis it increased insulin sensitivity and lowered testosterone in obese women. Non-obese women did not benefit from metformin. © The Author 2007.

N2  - Background: It has been reported that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) benefit from metformin therapy. Method(s): A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of obese (body mass index > 30 kg/m2), oligo-/amenorrhoeic women with PCOS. Metformin (850 mg) twice daily was compared with placebo over 6 months. All received the same advice from a dietitian. The primary outcome measures were: (i) change in menstrual cycle; (ii) change in arthropometric measurements; and (iii) changes in the endocrine parameters, insulin sensitivity and lipid profile. Result(s): A total of 143 subjects was randomized [metformin (MET) = 69; placebo (PL) = 74]. Both groups showed significant improvements in menstrual frequency [median increase (MET = 1, P < 0.001; PL = 1, P < 0.001)] and weight loss [mean (kg) (MET = 2.84; P < 0.001 and PL = 1.46; P = 0.011)]. However, there were no significant differences between the groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the independent variables (metformin, percentage of weight loss, initial BMI and age) in order to predict the improvement of menses. Only the percentage weight loss correlated with an improvement in menses (regression coefficient = 0.199, P = 0.047, odds ratio = 1.126, 95% CI 1.001, 1.266). There were no significant changes in insulin sensitivity or lipid profiles in either of the groups. Those who received metformin achieved a significant reduction in waist circumference and free androgen index. Conclusion(s): Metformin does not improve weight loss or menstrual frequency in obese patients with PCOS. Weight loss alone through lifestyle changes improves menstrual frequency. © The Author 2005.

N2  - Objective: A randomized, prospective pilot study was conducted to evaluate the clinical and endocrine parameters following laparoscopic unipolar and bipolar ovarian drilling in infertile women with clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Study Design: This was a randomized, prospective pilot study of 20 patients with clomiphene-resistant PCOS attending the gynecology outpatient department and gynecology endocrinology clinic of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (New Delhi, India). The patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: unipolar (group I) and bipolar (group II), of 10 patients each. Outcome measures were ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, changes in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone levels, and alteration of glucose tolerance and insulin levels. Result(s): After ovarian drilling, 6 patients (60%) in group I and 8 (80%) in group II ovulated spontaneously (p = 0.63), and 3 (30%) more patients ovulated after clomiphene citrate in group I and 1 (10%) in group II, with a total ovulation rate of 90% in both groups (p = 0.46). Six (6; 60%) pregnancies resulted in group I and 8 (80%) pregnancies resulted in group II (p = 0.63). LH levels fell significantly only in group II after 3 months (11.11 +/- 1.25 to 4.88 +/- 1.34 mIu/mL; p = 0.036), and there was no significant change in FSH and testosterone levels in either group. The fasting serum insulin levels increased nonsignificantly from 17.70 +/- 5.27 muIU/mL to 21.90 +/- 7.43 muIU/mL (p = 0.71) in group I and from 7.73 +/- muIU/mL to 13.11 +/- 3.55 muIU/mL (p = 0.27) in group II 3 months after surgery. Area under curve (AUC) glucose and insulin values fell postoperatively in both the groups. Conclusion(s): Laparoscopic bipolar ovarian drilling is an effective alternative to unipolar drilling in resuming ovulatory cycles and conception. Bipolar electrocoagulation has merits of favorable success rates along with expected safety and chances of fewer post-operative adhesions. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - In the last few years some studies assessed the effects of attenuation of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, obtained by insulin sensitizing agents, in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), suggesting potential scope for these drugs in treating the whole spectrum of reproductive, endocrine, and metabolic abnormalities found in such subjects. However, the results of these studies, mostly uncontrolled and short-term, are still inconclusive, and there is no long-term follow-up. In the present study, 23 PCOS subjects [mean (+/- SE) body mass index 30.0 +/- 1.1 kg/m2] were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with metformin (500 mg tid) or placebo for 6 months, while maintaining their usual eating habits. Before and after treatment, menstrual history, endocrine and metabolic profiles, serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone response to GnRH-agonist testing, and insulin sensitivity measured by the glucose clamp technique were assessed. Eighteen of these women, as well as 14 additional PCOS patients, were subsequently given metformin in an open trial for 11.0 +/- 1.3 months (range 4-26), to assess long-term effects of treatment and baseline predictors of metformin efficacy on reproductive abnormalities. After metformin treatment, mean frequency of menstruation improved (P = 0.002), due to striking amelioration of menstrual abnormalities in about 50% of subjects. Women given metformin showed reduced plasma insulin (at fasting: P = 0.057; during the clamp studies: P < 0.01) and increased insulin sensitivity (P < 0.05). Concurrently, ovarian hyperandrogenism was attenuated, as indicated by significant reductions in serum free testosterone (P < 0.05) and in the 17-hydroxyprogesterone response to GnRH-agonist testing (P < 0.05). No changes were found in the placebo group. Only comparable minor changes in body mass index were found both in the metformin group and in the placebo group. In the open, long-term trial 17 women (54.8%) showed striking improvements of their menstrual abnormalities and were considered as responders. Logistic regression analysis of baseline characteristics in responders and nonresponders showed that plasma insulin, serum androstenedione, and menstrual history were independent predictors of the treatment's clinical efficacy. In 10 subjects whose menses proved regular after treatment, the great majority of cycles became ovulatory (32 out of 39 assessed, 79%). In conclusion, in women with PCOS metformin treatment reduced hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenemia, independently of changes in body weight. In a large number of subjects these changes were associated with striking, sustained improvements in menstrual abnormalities and resumption of ovulation. Higher plasma insulin, lower serum androstenedione, and less severe menstrual abnormalities are baseline predictors of clinical response to metformin.

N2  - Previous research on polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has overwhelmingly been conducted within a medical or psychiatric framework, and has failed to explore women's own experience of the syndrome. Interviews were conducted with 30 women with PCOS recruited through a national self-help organisation. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed pervasive reports of feeling 'freakish', 'abnormal', and not 'proper' women. These feelings were related to three symptoms commonly experienced by women with PCOS: 'excess' hair growth; irregular, absent or disrupted periods; and infertility. Smooth hairless bodies and faces, regular menstruation and the capacity to bear children were associated with femininity, and as a result of their symptoms women expressed feeling 'different' from other women and less 'feminine'. The results are discussed within a feminist framework and suggest that polycystic ovarian syndrome is a deeply stigmatising condition, 'a theft of womanhood', with far reaching implications for all women, whether or not they conform to 'feminine' norms. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
