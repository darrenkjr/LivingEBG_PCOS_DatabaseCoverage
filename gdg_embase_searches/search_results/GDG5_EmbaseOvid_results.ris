N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of the letrozole and clomiphene citrate (CC) for ovulation induction in infertile women with polycystic-ovarian-syndrome (PCOS). METHOD(S): In this assessor blind randomized controlled trial 90 infertile women with PCOS were randomized to receive either letrozole or CC for ovulation induction in incremental doses for a maximum of three cycles. Main outcome measures studied were endometrial thickness, ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, rate of mono-follicular development and time to conception. RESULT(S): Mean endometrial thickness was 9.86 +/-2.32 mm and 9.39 +/- 2.06 mm with letrozole and clomiphene respectively (p = 0.751). Cumulative ovulation rate was 86.73 % & 85.21% with letrozole & clomiphene respectively (p =0.751). Pregnancy was achieved in 42.2% women in letrozole group and 20.0% in clomiphene group (p=0.04). Mono-follicular development was seen in 68.47% of ovulatory cycles in letrozole group compared to 44.89 % in clomiphene group (p=0.000). Mean time to achieve pregnancy was significantly shorter (log rank p = .042) with letrozole (9.65 weeks) than with CC (11.07). CONCLUSION(S): Letrozole is a better alternative for ovulation induction in anovulatory women with PCOS as pregnancy rates are higher, time to pregnancy is shorter and chances of multiple pregnancy are less due to high mono-follicular growth.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

N2  - Study Question: Does IVM of immature oocytes retrieved from small antral follicles in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an impact on obstetric and neonatal outcomes compared to controlled ovarian stimulation (COS)? Summary Answer: Obstetric and neonatal outcomes after IVM appear to be similar to those after COS. What is Know Already: Women with PCOS have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and congenital malformations in their offspring. For patients with PCOS who require IVF, IVM of germinal vesicle (GV)-stage oocytes retrieved from antral follicles has been adopted as a mild approach ART, with improved pregnancy rates over the last two decades. Although reports of obstetrical and neonatal outcomes after IVM have been reassuring, the limited sample sizes in previous studies preclude firm conclusions, and further study is warranted. Study Design, Size, Duration: This is a retrospective observational study analysing obstetric and neonatal data from 1036 clinical pregnancies in unique patients with PCOS who conceived following a cycle of IVM or COS between January 2010 and December 2016 in a tertiary reproductive centre. In total, 393 singleton pregnancies with a gestational age beyond 20 weeks were included. A phenotypic approach was used for the diagnosis of PCOS. Pregnancies following oocyte donation, standard IVF (as opposed to ICSI) or preimplantation genetic testing and pregnancies requiring testicular biopsy in the male partners were excluded. Participants/Materials,Setting, Methods: Pregnancy outcomes were analysed in women with PCOS phenotype A, C or D, as defined by different combinations of the Rotterdam criteria. Data from 164 pregnancies beyond 20 weeks after IVM were compared with those from 229 pregnancies after COS. Pregnancies in the IVM group were obtained after minimal ovarian stimulation and IVF with ICSI of transvaginally collected GV oocytes that had reached the metaphase II stage in vitro after 28 to 40 h of culture. No hCG trigger was administered before oocyte retrieval. Outcome measures were analysed or reported in singleton pregnancies only and included adverse obstetric events and neonatal health parameters, in particular birthweight, prematurity, small-for-gestational age, large-for-gestational age, perinatal death and major/minor malformation rates. The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and birthweight was analysed by multiple linear and logistic regression, adjusted for relevant treatment variables and maternal characteristics. Main Results and The Role of Chance: The IVM and the COS groups differed significantly (P < 0.001) for maternal circulating AMH levels and PCOS phenotype distribution, with more of the PCOS phenotype A in the IVM group. Pregnant women in the IVM group were younger than pregnant women in the COS group (P = 0.05). With regard to obstetric complications in singleton pregnancies, in the unadjusted analysis, mothers of infants in the IVM group more often had HDP (29/164 (17.9%) vs 22/229 (9.6%), P = 0.02) compared with mothers in the COS group. Singletons born after IVM and COS had a similar birthweight standard deviation score (SDS) (0.51 +/- 0.94 after IVM vs 0.33 +/- 1.05 after COS, P = 0.19). Preterm birth rate (32-36.9 weeks) and early preterm birth rate (<32 weeks) were also similar in both groups. The total malformation rate was 4.1% in singletons after IVM and 2.4% in singletons after COS. Multivariate linear regression analysis accounting for relevant confounders demonstrated that parity was the only independent predictive factor (P = 0.04) for birthweight SDS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that BMI, parity and type of ART (IVM as opposed to COS) were significantly correlated with the incidence of HDP. Only patients with the PCOS phenotype A showed a tendency towards a higher risk of HDP in those who underwent IVM compared to those who had COS. Limitations, Reasons for Caution: The study is limited by its retrospective nature and loss to follow-up of a subset of children with no information regarding congenital malformations. Furthermore, the paediatricians who assessed the children after birth were not blinded for the type of ART procedure. Wider Implications of the Findings: This study provides further evidence that, compared to COS, IVM of oocytes derived from small antral follicles does not adversely affect the neonatal health of the offspring of patients with PCOS. The observed increased risk of HDP in patients with PCOS phenotype A following IVM treatment warrants further scrutiny.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate age-related variations in the effect of body mass index (BMI) on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a cohort study conducted by retrospectively investigating the IVF cycles of 653 polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients under the age of 40 years who were diagnosed based on the Rotterdam criteria in a private IVF clinic between 2005 and 2015. The study included data from 653 IVF cycles of PCOS patients. The patients were classified into three groups based on their BMI, i.e., normal weight (n=299), overweight (n=208), and obese (n=146). The patients were also grouped by age: 562 patients were under the age of 35 years and 91 patients were above the age of 35 years. Then, BMI- and age-related variations in the IVF cycle parameters and clinical pregnancy rates of patients with PCOS were investigated. The Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square statistical assessment method was used to determine whether the effect of BMI on IVF outcomes varies with age. Result(s): Variations in cycle variables with BMI and age showed that IVF cycles were negatively affected by increases in obesity and age. Clinical pregnancy rates were found to be lower in the obese group than in the other groups, particularly in the age group above 35 years; however, this difference could not be proven statistically. Conclusion(s): The present study evaluated obesity and clinical pregnancy rates in IVF cycles in PCOS patients according to age groups, and particularly in the obese group, the clinical pregnancy rates were observed to be lower in the age group >=35 years than in the other BMI groups; however, this difference was found to be statistically insignificant.Copyright Â© 2016 by the Turkish-German Gynecological Education and Research Foundation.

N2  - Purpose The purpose is a comparison of effectiveness of myo-inositol and metformin in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) treated with letrozole. Methods This study is a randomized single-blind controlled clinical trial undertaken in 150 infertile PCOS women. For all patients, letrozole is prescribed at a dose of 7.5 mg per day from the third day of menstruation for 5 days. Patients who did not ovulate were included and divided into three pretreatment groups: group I(control group), 200 microg of folic acid (as a placebo); group II, 1500 mg of metformin daily plus 200 microg of folic acid, and group III, inositol 2 g plus 200 microg of folic acid received twice daily for 3 months. In the last cycle, 7.5 mg letrozole was prescribed for the induction of ovulation. Primary outcomes were ovary function and pregnancy. Results The ovarian function was not significantly different in those groups, whereas the ovarian function of inositol + folic acid group in normal BMI found significantly higher than other BMI spectra. In addition, the ovarian function is significantly higher in the inositol + folic acid group by increasing the infertility duration. The incidence of pregnancy is lower in letrozole + folic acid + inositol group than the other groups; however, it is not significant. Conclusion The addition of inositol and metformin to the treatment of infertile PCOS women with letrozole resistance improves the ovarian function; however, it is not significant. Of note, inositol was more effective than metformin in patients with normal BMI.Copyright Â© Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2019.

N2  - Introduction: The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common condition associated with chronic anovulation affecting 4 to 6% of reproductive age women. Aim(s): To compare the effectiveness of laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) for ovulation induction with gonadotropins in clomiphene-resistant PCOS in terms of ovulation, pregnancy, live birth, abortion, multiple pregnancies, and complication like ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Setting and design: A prospective hospital-based randomized trial. Material(s) and Method(s): It was a prospective study, which was carried out from January 2012 to May 2015. Totally, 89 women were evaluated in the study, out of which 44 women were in gonadotropin group and 45 were in LOD group. Statistical analysis: Standard statistical analysis was done and significance of difference in results was tested by chi-square test. Result(s): Ovulation rate in gonadotropin group was 75.0% at 6 months, whereas in LOD group, it was 20% at 3 months and was increased up to 66.66% after addition of clomiphene citrate and gonadotropin. The primary outcome in terms of pregnancy in gonadotropin group was 45.45% after 6 cycles and in LOD group was 11.11% after 3 cycles and 40.00% after 6 cycles with supplementation of clomiphene citrate and gonadotropin. Conclusion(s): The ongoing pregnancy rate from ovulation induction with LOD alone was significantly less but if supplemented by clomiphene citrate and gonadotropin, it seems equivalent to ovulation induction with gonadotropin, but the former procedure carries a lower risk of multiple pregnancies.Copyright Â© 2017, Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: Does in vitro maturation (IVM) result in non-inferior cumulative live birth rates compared to those after standard in vitro fertilization (IVF) in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? SUMMARY ANSWER: One cycle of IVM, without any stimulation, was inferior to one cycle of standard IVF in women with PCOS in terms of 6-month cumulative live birth rates, when choosing single vitrified-warmed blastocyst transfer. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: IVM is an emerging alternative treatment for women with PCOS who need assisted reproductive technology. Since a minimal or even zero dose of gonadotropins are required in the IVM procedure, the occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is eliminated. Only one clinical trial comparing the pregnancy outcome between IVM with FSH priming and IVF has been reported. However, it is still unknown whether IVM treatment without any stimulation can offer a similar live birth outcome in women with PCOS as compared to that in women receiving the standard IVF procedure with ovarian stimulation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This single-centre, open-label randomized controlled non-inferiority trial in an academic infertility centre in China was performed between March 2018 and July 2019. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women aged 20-38 years with PCOS and infertility scheduled for their first IVF attempt were eligible. In total, 351 women were randomly allocated to receive one cycle of unstimulated IVM (n = 175) or one cycle of standard IVF with a flexible GnRH antagonist protocol and hCG as ovulatory trigger (n = 176). A freeze-All and single blastocyst transfer strategy was used in both groups. The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy (leading to live birth) within 6 months after randomization. A non-inferiority margin of 15% was considered. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The IVM procedure without additional gonadotropin resulted in a lower ongoing pregnancy (leading to live birth) within 6 months after randomization compared to standard IVF treatment (22.3% vs. 50.6%; rate difference-28.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI]:-37.9% to-18.7%). Moderate-severe OHSS did not occur in the IVM group, while in the IVF group, ten women (5.7%) had moderate OHSS and one woman (0.6%) had severe OHSS. There was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of obstetric and perinatal complications. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The trial was conducted using an IVM protocol without additional stimulation in a single centre, which may limit its generalizability. In addition, a GnRH agonist trigger rather than hCG for IVF stimulation in women with PCOS would be more consistent with current clinical practice. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Although IVM is considered to be a convenient, inexpensive and safe alternative to IVF for women with PCOS, our results indicated that one cycle of IVM without any stimulation was inferior to one cycle of standard IVF in terms of the cumulative live birth rate. The inferiority of IVM without ovarian stimulation could be mainly due to the limitations in the developmental potential of embryos. Further IVM development should be tested and validated in a freeze-only and blastocyst transfer setting. Further RCTs are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of other IVM protocols or multiple cycles of IVM compared to IVF.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by various endocrine/metabolic disorders and impaired reproductive potential. Alterations in oocyte competence are considered potentially causative factors for infertility in PCOS women and analyzing the composition of follicular fluid in these patients may help to identify which changes have the potential to alter oocyte quality. In this study, free fatty acid metabolic signatures in follicular fluid were performed to identify changes that may impact oocyte competence in non-obese PCOS women. Sixty-four non-obese women (32 with PCOS and 32 age- and BMI-matched controls) undergoing in vitro fertilization were recruited. Embryo quality was morphologically assessed. Free fatty acid metabolic profiling in follicular fluid was performed using gas/liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis models were further constructed. Nine free fatty acids and 24 eicosanoids were identified and several eicosanoids synthesized by the cyclooxygenase pathway were significantly elevated in PCOS patients compared to controls. The combination of PGE2, PGF2alpha, PGJ2, and TXB2 had an area under the curve of 0.867 (0.775-0.960) for PCOS discrimination. Furthermore, follicular fluid levels of PGE2 and PGJ2 were negatively correlated with high-quality embryo rate in PCOS patients (P < 0.05). Metabolomic analysis revealed that follicular fluid lipidomic profiles undergo changes in non-obese PCOS women, which suggests that identifying changes in important metabolic signatures may give us a better understanding of the pathogenesis of PCOS. Furthermore, elevated PGE2 and PGJ2 concentrations may contribute to impaired oocyte competence in non-obese PCOS patients.Copyright Â© 2022 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.

N2  - Background: The purpose of this research was to investigate whether high AMH levels in PCOS patients resulted in different IVF outcomes compared to those in non-PCOS patients. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study was conducted involving 238 women undergoing IVF who had AMH levels > 4 ng/ml. Participants were divided into two groups: PCOS and non-PCOS. Result(s): The median AMH level was significantly higher in the PCOS group (7.59 +/- 4.61 ng/ml vs. 5.91 +/- 2.22 ng/ml, p < 0.001). The PCOS group required less gonadotropin but yielded more oocytes after stimulation. Significantly more participants from the PCOS group (41.5% [n = 39]) developed a hyperresponse to ovarian stimulation compared to the non-PCOS group (26.4% [n = 38]) (OR = 1.978, 95% CI 1.138-3.488; p = 0.015). Conclusion(s): There were significant differences in terms of total doses of gonadotropin and the number of oocytes retrieved in the PCOS and non-PCOS groups. Women with PCOS and high AMH levels have a higher risk of hyperresponse after ovarian stimulation than women without PCOS.Copyright Â© 2022, The Author(s).

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effects of body mass index (BMI) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) with intrauterine insemination (IUI). Method(s): This retrospective study evaluated couples with PCOS undergoing COS and IUI. The relationship between cumulative IUI pregnancy outcomes and BMI, treatment cycles, treatment schemes, number of dominant follicles, endometrial thickness, infertility duration and type of infertility was analysed. Result(s): The study evaluated 831 IUI cycles in 451 couples with PCOS. Compared with normoweight women, overweight and obese women required more human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) doses and more days of COS. Gestational diabetes mellitus occurred more frequently in the obese group than in the other BMI groups. The clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in the hMG, clomiphene citrate (CC) + hMG and letrozole (LE) + hMG groups were significantly higher than those in the CC and LE groups. The clinical pregnancy rate was higher in the secondary infertility group compared with the primary infertility group. Conclusion(s): Obese women might require more hMG doses and more days of COS to overcome the effects of weight. As BMI increases, the incidence of gestational diabetes might also increase. The number of cycles and type of infertility may have a predictive value for pregnancy outcomes.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - Hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is often disturbed within polycystic ovarian syndrome which usually manifested by high LH to FSH ratio. In addition to the signs and symptoms of the syn-drome, this hormonal imbalance leads to an ovulation resulting in sub-fertility with the need for assisted reproductive techniques as traditional IVF or ICSI. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of high LH/FSH ratio in PCOS women on oocytes' quality, embryos' quality and pregnancy rate following ICSI. Forty-seven sub-fertile women who had PCOS were included in this observational comparative study throughout the period from January, 2019 to March, 2020. Initial cycle day 2 hormonal profiles (E2, LH, FSH and prolactin) were measured and calculation of LH/FSH ratio was done. They divided into 2 groups according to LH/FSH ratio. All females were subjected to controlled ovarian stimulation followed by ICSI. Microscopic assessment of oocytes' quality, embryos' quality and calculation of pregnancy rate was done with comparison of the results between the two groups. The study showed that women who had a high LH/FSH ratio produce more oocytes 11.4 +/- 5.2 VS 9.2 +/- 4.5 in those with normal ratio with a mean total number of mature oocytes 9.1 +/- 4.9 VS 7.44 +/- 4.5 in women with normal ratio. The mean total number of bad quality embryos in the women with high ratio was more 1.2 +/- 1.6 VS 0.17 +/- 0.69 in the women with normal ratio. There is insignificant increase in Pregnancy rate in the high ratio women 50% VS 32.4% in the normal ratio one. Women with PCOS who had a high LH/FSH ratio had a higher pregnancy rate than those with normal LH/FSH ratio but the increment is not significant. The effect of high LH/FSH ratio on oocytes' and embryos' quality in those women was inconclusive.Copyright Â© 2021, Colegio de Farmaceuticos de la Provincia de Buenos Aires. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is considered to be one of the most common endocrine disorders in women of reproductive age. Zinc, a vital trace element in the body, plays a key role in maintaining health, especially due to its antioxidant role. On the other hand, lack of antioxidants and oxidative stress can adversely affect oocytes quality and consequently fertility rate. The available studies that report the effect of follicular fluid (FF) zinc in terms of the number and quality of the oocytes in infertile women with PCOS, are few and not consistent. We decided to investigate this issue. Material(s) and Method(s): In this cross-sectional study, from the women with PCOS referring to Omolbanin Hospi-tal, Dezful, Iran (February to December 2019), a total of 90 samples (follicular fluid, oocytes, and embryos) were collected from those who had undergone in vitro fertilization (IVF). To measure zinc level in follicular fluid, high performance liquid chromatograpy (HPLC) was utilized. Also, oocytes maturity and embryos quality evaluation was performed using inverted optical microscopy. One-way ANOVA and Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) were used for data analysis. Result(s): The amount of FF zinc was not associated with any significant differences in the number of oocytes and metaphase I (MI) and germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes, but a significant decrease was observed in the number of meta-phase II (MII) oocytes at zinc values less than 35 microg/dL. The FF zinc levels less than 35 microg/dL were also significantly associated with decreased embryo quality. Conclusion(s): A significant relationship was found between the level of FF zinc and the quality and the number of oo-cytes taken from the ovaries of infertile patients with PCOS history who were candidates for IVF treatment as well as the number of high quality embryos.Copyright Â© 2021, Royan Institute (ACECR).

N2  - Objective: To compare the efficacy of letrozole and clomiphene citrate (CC) for ovulation induction in infertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): In this assessor blind, randomized controlled trial, 90 infertile women with PCOS were randomized to receive either letrozole or CC for ovulation induction in incremental doses for a maximum of three cycles. Main outcome measures studied were endometrial thickness, ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, rate of monofollicular development, and time to conception. Result(s): Mean endometrial thicknesses were 9.86 +/- 2.32 mm and 9.39 +/- 2.06 mm with letrozole and CC, respectively (P=0.751). Cumulative ovulation rates were 86.7% and 85.2% with letrozole and CC, respectively (P=0.751). Pregnancy was achieved in 42.2% of women in the letrozole group and 20.0% of women in the CC group (P=0.04). Monofollicular development was seen in 68.4% of ovulatory cycles in the letrozole group compared with 44.8% in the CC group (P=0.000). Mean time to achieve pregnancy was significantly shorter (log rank P=0.042) with letrozole (9.65 weeks) than with CC (11.07 weeks). Conclusion(s): Letrozole is a better alternative for ovulation induction in anovulatory women with PCOS as pregnancy rates are higher, time to pregnancy is shorter, and chances of multiple pregnancy are less because of high monofollicular growth.Copyright Â© 2020 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects fertility. There are two types of PCOS; the normal/lean type and overweight/obese type. The aim of this study was to assess baseline characteristics, ovarian response, quality of oocytes, embryos, pregnancy, implantation and live birth rates in normal/lean and overweight/obese patients with PCOS undergoing ICSI compared with patients without PCOS. This retrospective case-control analytical study included 38 normal/lean and 17 overweight/obese patients with PCOS, and 98 normal/lean and 17 overweight/obese patients without PCOS. Parameters were observed based on baseline characteristics, ovarian response to dosage and duration of gonadotropin administered, number of oocytes, matured oocytes, fertilization rate, embryo quality and development, pregnancy, implantation and live birth rates. Basal serum luteinizing hormone in normal/lean PCOS was significantly higher compared with non-PCOS groups. Total dosage of gonadotropin used was significantly lower in normal/lean PCOS compared with other groups. End estradiol levels in normal/lean PCOS was significantly higher compared with the non-PCOS groups. Number of follicles, retrieved oocytes and matured oocytes were significantly higher in PCOS groups compared with the non-PCOS groups. However, there were no differences in fertilized oocytes, cleavage, number of top-quality embryos, pregnancy, implantation, and live birth rates among groups. This present study suggests that normal/lean PCOS requires lower gonadotropin dosages and that patients with PCOS have more follicles and oocytes compared with patients without PCOS, however the number of fertilized oocytes and embryos from patients with PCOS were the same as those from patients without PCOS and suggested that the quality of retrieved oocytes in PCOS might be compromised.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: Does the phenotype of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affect clinical outcomes of ART following in-vitro oocyte maturation? SUMMARY ANSWER: Cumulative live birth rates (CLBRs) after IVM were significantly different between distinct PCOS phenotypes, with the highest CLBR observed in patients with phenotype A/HOP (= hyperandrogenism + ovulatory disorder + polycystic ovaries), while IVM in patients with phenotype C/HP (hyperandrogenism + polycystic ovaries) or D/OP (ovulatory disorder + polycystic ovaries) resulted in lower CLBRs (OR 0.26 (CI 0.06-1.05) and OR 0.47 (CI 0.25-0.88), respectively, P=0.03). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: CLBRs in women with hyperandrogenic PCOS phenotypes (A/HOP and C/HP) have been reported to be lower after ovarian stimulation (OS) and ART when compared to CLBR in women with a normo-androgenic PCOS phenotype (D/OP) and non-PCOS patients with a PCO-like ovarian morphology (PCOM). Whether there is an influence of the different PCOS phenotypes on success rates of IVM has been unknown. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a single-centre, retrospective cohort study including 320 unique PCOS patients performing their first IVM cycle between April 2014 and January 2018 in a tertiary referral hospital. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Baseline patient characteristics and IVM treatment cycle data were collected. The clinical outcomes following the first IVM embryo transfer were retrieved, including the CLBR defined as the number of deliveries with at least one live birth resulting from one IVM cycle and all appended cycles in which fresh or frozen embryos were transferred until a live birth occurred or until all embryos were used. The latter was considered as the primary outcome. A multivariate regression model was developed to identify prognostic factors for CLBR and test the impact of the patient's PCOS phenotype. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Half of the patients presented with a hyperandrogenic PCOS phenotype (n=140 A/HOP and n=20 C/HP vs. n=160 D/OP). BMI was significantly different between phenotype groups (27.4+/-5.4 kg/m2 for A/HOP, 27.1+/-5.4 kg/m2 for C/HP and 23.3+/-4.4 kg/m2 for D/OP, P<0.001). Metformin was used in 33.6% of patients with PCOS phenotype A/HOP, in 15.0% of C/HP patients and in 11.2% of D/OP patients (P<0.001). Anti-mullerian hormone levels differed significantly between groups: 12.4+/-8.3 mug/l in A/HOP, 7.7+/-3.1 mg/l in C/HP and 10.4+/-5.9 mg/l in D/OP patients (P=0.01). The number of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) was significantly different between phenotype groups: 25.9+/-19.1 COC in patients with phenotype A/HOP, 18.3+/-9.0 COC in C/HP and 19.8+/-13.5 COC in D/OP (P=0.004). After IVM, patients with different phenotypes also had a significantly different number of mature oocytes (12.4+/-9.3 for A/HOP vs. 6.5+/-4.2 for C/HP vs. 9.1+/-6.9 for D/OP, P<0.001). The fertilisation rate, the number of usable embryos and the number of cycles with no embryo available for transfer were comparable between the three groups. Following the first embryo transfer, the positive hCG rate and LBR were comparable between the patient groups (44.7% (55/123) for A/HOP, 40.0% (6/15) for C/HP, 36.7% (47/128) for D/OP, P=0.56 and 25.2% (31/123) for A/HOP, 6.2% (1/15) for C/HP, 26.6% (34/128) for D/OP, respectively, P=0.22). However, the incidence of early pregnancy loss was significantly different across phenotype groups (19.5% (24/123) for A/HOP, 26.7% (4/15) for C/HP and 10.2% (13/128) for D/OP, P=0.04). The CLBR was not significantly different following univariate analysis (40.0% (56/140) for A/HOP, 15% (3/20) for C/HP and 33.1% (53/160) for D/OP (P=0.07)). When a multivariable logistic regression model was developed to account for confounding factors, the PCOS phenotype appeared to be significantly correlated with CLBR, with a more favourable CLBR in the A/HOP subgroup (OR 0.26 for phenotype C/HP (CI 0.06-1.05) and OR 0.47 for phenotype D/OP (CI 0.25-0.88), P=0.03)). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: These data should be interpreted with caution as the retrospective nature of the study holds the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors and misassignment of the PCOS phenotype. Moreover, the sample size for phenotype C/HP was too small to draw conclusions for this subgroup of patients. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Caucasian infertile patients with a PCOS phenotype A/HOP who undergo IVM achieved a higher CLBR than their counterparts with C/HP and D/OP. This is in strong contrast with previously reported outcomes following OS where women with PCOS and hyperandrogenism (A/HOP and C/HP) performed significantly worse. For PCOS patients who require ART, the strategy of OS followed by an elective freeze-all strategy remains to be compared with IVM in a prospective fashion; however, the current data provide support for IVM as a valid treatment option, especially in the most severe PCOS phenotypes (A/HOP). Our data suggest that proper patient selection is of utmost importance in an IVM programme.

N2  - Objective: Oxidative stress may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and poor outcomes after assisted reproduction treatment. It is unclear if systematic oxidative stress is correlated with live birth rate in patients with PCOS after controlled ovarian stimulation. This study aimed to investigate the serum oxidative stress markers on the day of trigger hCG and its relationship with live birth rate in young non-obese women with or without PCOS undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatment. Study design: In this prospective cohort study, 50 patients with PCOS and 50 patients without PCOS aged less than 35 years and undergoing IVF/ICSI between February 2017 and January 2018 were studied. The body mass index (BMI) of all participants was less than 28 kg/m2. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels on the day of hCG were measured. Demographic and cycle characteristics, embryo laboratory data and pregnancy outcomes after fresh embryo transfer were analyzed. Univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze independent variables predicting the live birth rate. Result(s): After conventional ovarian stimulation, the patients with PCOS had higher serum MDA and GPx concentrations (P < 0.03) and lower serum SOD levels (P < 0.03) on the hCG trigger day than the controls. Further, the serum MDA and GPx levels on the trigger day were also positively correlated with the number of good quality embryos (R = 0.26, P = 0.01; R = 0.21, P = 0.04; respectively). However, cycle characteristics, IVF/ICSI outcomes and pregnancy outcomes were comparable between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the rate of good quality embryos (OR 1.04, 95 %CI 1.01-1.06, P = 0.005) and the duration of infertility (OR 0.74, 95 %CI 0.56-0.98, P = 0.04) were predictive factors of live birth rate. The ROC curve analysis showed the AUC for the model was 0.76 (95 %CI: 0.67-0.86, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The data suggest that moderate systemic oxidative stress on the hCG trigger day had no detrimental effects on live birth rate in young and non-obese patients with PCOS after IVF/ICSI treatment.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Objective. To examine the association between body mass index (BMI) and the outcome of in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection embryo transfer- (IVF/ICSI-ET) assisted reproduction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) receiving the ultra-long agonist protocol. Methods. We retrospectively identified all women receiving IVF/ICSI-ET for the first time using the ultra-long protocol between January 2013 and January 2018 at our hospital. Only women at <=35 years of age receiving the first cycle were analyzed. Results. A total of 1782 women were included in the analysis: 42 were underweight, 742 were overweight, 198 were obese, and 800 were normal weight. Gonadotropin dosage and duration were comparable between underweight and normal weight groups but were significantly higher/longer in overweight and obese groups (P<0.008). The number of oocytes retrieved was significantly lower in overweight and obese groups than in the normal weight group (P<0.008). The number of transferable embryos was significantly higher in normal weight group than overweight and obese groups (P<0.008). Embryo implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, full-term birth rate, and live birth rate did not differ among the 4 groups. The cycle cancellation rate was lower in the overweight and obese group than normal weight group (P<0.008). The miscarriage rate was higher in the obese group than the normal weight group (P<0.008). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, abnormal BMI was an independent risk for miscarriage (OR: 1.069, 95% CI 1.020, 1.122; P=0.006). Conclusion. Overweight and obesity are associated with poor outcomes in PCOS patients receiving ultra-long protocol. Measures to reduce body weight should be encouraged in overweight and obese PCOS women at <=35 years of age prior to assisted reproductive technology (ART).Copyright Â© 2020 Han Zhou et al.

N2  - Background: The objective of this study was to describe the association between luteinizing hormone (LH)/ follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio and demographic variables and maturation stage of oocytes in insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in comparison with control group. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case-control study, 60 patients with in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplas-mic sperm injection (ICSI) indication were subdivided into 3 groups as follow: 20 subjects were assigned to control (fertile women with male infertility history) group, 20 subjects with PCOS were insulin resistant (IR) and 20 subjects with PCOS were insulin sensitive (IS). After puncture, retrieved oocytes were classified into metaphase II (MII) as mature and in metaphase I (MI) or germinal vesicle stage (GV) as immature. Regression analyses were used to explore the association between MII oocyte number and demographic and clinical variables. Result(s): LH/FSH ratio was significantly higher in PCOS-IR women compared to controls but not significantly different from that of PCOS-IS group. PCOS-IR women had lower MII oocyte number compared with that of controls. According to multiple regression analysis, the number of previous assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles was negatively associated with the number of MII oocytes. Conclusion(s): Insulin resistance can be associated with reductions in MII oocyte number in patients with PCOS.Copyright Â© 2019, Royan Institute (ACECR). All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Objective: The aim of our study was to compare the BMI and metabolic values of fertile and infertile groups in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to determine the effect of obesity and metabolic status on fertility and infertile groups and the fertility effect of obesity. Material(s) and Method(s): The clinical and metabolic data of 230 patients who presented to the gynecology outpatient clinic of our hospital between 2013 and 2018 and were diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam Diagnosis Criteria were evaluated. Body mass index (BMI), waist ratio, menstrual period, fertility status, fertility duration, parity status, presence and degree of hirsutism were evaluated. 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed following appropriate diet and fasting period. Fasting glucose and insulin levels and insulin resistance cases were determined. Total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol levels were determined. Patients with BMI; The patients were divided into two groups as fertile and infertile, evaluated for obesity and metabolic data, and data on the relationship with BMI were calculated statistically. These metabolic disorders were compared to BMI and fertility status. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 26.7 years. The mean BMI was 28.92 +/- 5.95 kg / m2. Only 25% of the patients had normal weight and 73% were overweight. 4 (1.7%) cases in the weak group with BMI less than 18.5, 58 (25.2%) cases in normal weight group with BMI 19-24.9, 71 (30.9%) in overweight group with BMI 25-29.9 There were 86 cases (37.4%) in obese group with BMI 30-39.9 and 11 cases (4.8%) in morbidly obese group with BMI of 40 and above. u (21.5%) is fertile. The duration of infertility ranged from 12 to 196 months, with a mean of 33.92 +/- 24.25 months and a median of 24 months. The waist circumference is between 62 and 135 cm and the average is 87.76 +/- 13.48 cm. The waist / hip ratio ranged from 0.65 to 0.98 and the mean was 0.80 +/- 0.06. The distribution of BMI was similar in the fertile and infertile groups. 99 (43.1%) of the patients had insulin resistance, 77 (33.5%) had impaired glucose tolerance and 12 (5.2%) had DM. Mean blood lipid levels were not significantly different between fertile and infertile groups. The distribution of glucose metabolism disorders was similar in both groups. Conclusion(s): Obesity and metabolic disorders are more common in PCOS cases. There was no significant difference between fertile and infertile groups according to BMI.Copyright Â© 2019 Zeynep Kamil Kadin ve Cocuk Hastaliklari Egitim ve Arastirma Hastanesi.

N2  - Objectives: Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a common endocrine-disrupting chemical, which has potential reproductive toxicity. This study aimed to explore the effects of DEHP exposure in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) undergoing in vitro fertilization. Method(s): In this case-control study, DEHP levels in follicular fluid (FF) of women with PCOS (n = 56) and controls (n = 51) were measured. The in vitro effects of DEHP exposure on primary-cultured human granulosa cells (GCs) and a steroidogenic human granulosa-like tumor cell line (KGN cells) were analyzed. Result(s): Concentrations of DEHP in FF were significantly higher in women with PCOS than in controls. The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly lower in women with PCOS with high levels of DEHP than in controls. The levels of androgens produced by human GCs were significantly increased following DEHP exposure. Compared with controls, DEHP-treated human GCs and KGN cells showed significantly lower viability, cell cycle arrest, higher apoptosis, and altered expression of apoptosis-related genes. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS are exposed to increased levels of DEHP in follicles, which may be associated with pregnancy loss following in vitro fertilization. DEHP may disrupt steroid production, balance in cellular proliferation, and apoptosis in human granulosa cells.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2019.

N2  - Background: Previous studies have shown that among women with polycystic ovary syndrome who have difficulties conceiving, frozen-embryo transfer resulted in increased live birth rates and decreased ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome risk than did fresh-embryo transfer. In the present retrospective analysis, we sought to determine the effect of body mass index (BMI) on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes in women with PCOS undergoing FET. Method(s): Women with PCOS (n = 1556) undergoing FET were divided into groups based on weight, with those with normal weight having a BMI of 18.5-24.9 kg/m2,those who were overweight having a BMI of 25-29.9 kg/m2, and those who were obese having a BMI >=30 kg/m2. Both pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were compared among these groups. Result(s): The normal-weight, overweight, or obese groups exhibited similar pregnancy outcomes, including clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, ongoing pregnancy rate and live birth rate. In singletons, birth characteristics regarding newborn gender, gestational age, birthweight and length at birth were comparable between the three groups. For adverse neonatal outcomes, the three groups showed no significant differences on the rates of low birthweight, very low birthweight, preterm birth, and very preterm birth after adjustment. In addition, the obstetric complications and the frequencies of live-birth defects were also comparable between the three groups except that overweight and obese women were more likely than women of normal weight to have delivered via cesarean section. Conclusion(s): BMI did not affect the pregnancy or perinatal outcomes in women with PCOS undergoing FET.Copyright Â© 2019 The Author(s).

T1  - Establishing an Anti-Mullerian hormone cutoff for diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome in women of reproductive age-bearing Indian ethnicity using the automated Anti-Mullerian hormone assay
A1  - Mahajan N.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosed by Rotterdam criteria, is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. The criteria of polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) are subject to operator variability and technological advances. Serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level has been proposed as a more reliable alternative to antral follicle count. There is a paucity of data on use of AMH for diagnosis of PCOS in Indian women. Aim and Objectives: The aim of this study is to determine a cutoff level for AMH that could facilitate diagnosis of PCOS and its phenotypes in women of Indian origin using the automated (Roche) assay and to compare the competence of oocytes in PCOS and non-PCOS women undergoing in vitro fertilization-intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI). Materials and Methodology: A total of 367 women undergoing treatment at our fertility center between February 2017 and August 2017 were prospectively enrolled in this study. Of these, 133 were diagnosed with PCOS, 69 had isolated PCOM, and 165 (controls) had normal ovaries on ultrasound examination. Serum AMH levels were assessed using the fully automated Roche Elecsys immunoassay. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocol was used for IVF-ICSI in all patients. Statistical Analysis Used: Quantitative variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Qualitative variables were correlated using the Chi-square test. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Result(s): Mean AMH concentrations in women with PCOS was higher (7.56 +/- 4.36 ng/mL) in comparison to PCOM and controls. Serum AMH concentration >5.03 ng/mL could facilitate diagnosis of PCOS (area under the curve = 0.826); sensitivity-70.68%, specificity of 79.91%. There was no difference in the ratio of mature to total oocytes retrieved in the three groups (P > 0.05). Mean number of mature oocytes was lower in controls than PCOS and PCOM (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Serum AMH concentration >5.03 ng/mL could be used as cutoff value for the diagnosis of PCOS in women of Indian origin.Copyright Â© 2019 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

N2  - Irisin, a novel exercise-induced myokine, has been implicated in different aspects of human metabolism and could be connected to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study aimed to investigate serum and follicular fluid (FF) irisin levels in PCOS and normal women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation and correlate them to the lipid and lipoprotein levels as well as with other metabolic parameters. Serum and FF irisin, together with serum lipid and lipoprotein levels were assessed in 70 women with diagnosed PCOS and 70 non-PCOS controls, under in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Regardless of BMI, PCOS women had a significantly increased number of oocytes retrieved, fertilized oocytes and transferred embryos, although the number of women achieving pregnancies did not differ between groups. No correlation between FF irisin levels and pregnancy could be established. Serum and FF irisin levels were significantly higher in PCOS and overweight women and were positively associated with BMI and dyslipidemia. FF irisin levels correlated positively to and were lower than serum irisin levels. Further research would be helpful to analyze irisin's role in female reproduction, if any, as well as in human metabolism and the pathophysiology of PCOS.Copyright Â© 2019, Â© 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Objective: Lifestyle intervention is the recommended first-line treatment for overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, the efficacy of lifestyle change in improving reproductive function is still unclear. Design(s): A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with allocation to a behavioural modification programme (intervention) or minimal intervention (control) for 4 months with a follow-up at 12 months. Patient(s): Sixty-eight women, aged 18-40 years, body mass index (BMI) >= 27 kg/m2, fulfilling all Rotterdam PCOS criteria were randomized to treatment. Measurements: The primary outcome was improved menstrual regularity. Secondary outcomes were ovulation and pregnancy rates. Result(s): At 4 months, the weight loss was significant in the intervention group (-2.1%, P = 0.002) and nonsignificant in the control group (-1.0%). A higher proportion of patients in the intervention group improved menstrual regularity compared to the control group, mean difference 35% (95% CI: 16-60), P = 0.003. There was no difference in ovulation rate between groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that intervention was the only predictor of improved menstrual function, OR 3.9 (95% CI: 1.3-11.9). At 12 months, a total of 54% of the women improved menstrual regularity compared to baseline (P = 0.000) and 43% (P = 0.000) had confirmed ovulation. 38% of the women wishing to become pregnant succeeded within 1 year of study completion. Conclusion(s): This is the first RCT in overweight women with PCOS showing efficacy in improving reproductive function following behavioural modification intervention in comparison with minimal intervention. Although extensive weight loss is difficult to achieve in these women, behavioural modification intervention can help improve reproductive function.Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - The increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in granulosa cells (GCs) may affect the pregnancy results in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In this study, we compared the in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) results of 22 patients with PCOS and 25 patients with tubal factor infertility and detected the ROS levels in the GCs of these two groups. Results showed that the PCOS group had significantly larger follicles on the administration day for human chorionic gonadotropin than the tubal factor group (P < 0.05); however, the number of retrieved oocytes was not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). PCOS group had slightly lower fertilization, cleavage, grade I/II embryo, clinical pregnancy, and implantation rates and higher miscarriage rate than the tubal factor group (P > 0.05). We further found a significantly higher ROS level of GCs in the PCOS group than in the tubal factor group (P < 0.05). The increased ROS levels in GCs caused GC apoptosis, whereas NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) specific inhibitors (diphenyleneiodonium and apocynin) significantly reduced the ROS production in the PCOS group. In conclusion, the increased ROS expression levels in PCOS GCs greatly induced cell apoptosis, which further affected the oocyte quality and reduced the positive IVF-ET pregnancy results of women with PCOS. NADPH oxidase pathway may be involved in the mechanism of ROS production in GCs of women with PCOS.

N2  - Purpose: To compare the concentrations of beta endorphin in serum and follicular fluid (FF) of PCOS- and non-PCOS women. Secondarily, to investigate associations between beta endorphin and other parameters. Method(s): Fifty-nine women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) were included in the study. Sixteen were stratified to the PCOS group using the Rotterdam criteria. The remaining 43 women served as controls. Follicular fluid was collected during oocyte retrieval and peripheral blood sampling was performed on the same day. Beta endorphin concentrations in serum and follicular fluid, serum levels of insulin, glucose, LH, estradiol and progesterone were measured. Additionally, testosterone was measured before starting the stimulation protocol. Result(s): There was no difference in beta endorphin levels between PCOS- and non-PCOS women. The concentration of the peptide was higher in serum than in FF, likely due to collection of FF after ovulation induction and corresponding to the early luteal phase. We found a significant correlation between the number of mature Metaphase II (MII) oocytes retrieved and beta endorphin concentration in FF. In women with biochemical hyperandrogenemia, beta endorphin levels in FF correlated with testosterone levels. Conclusion(s): Beta Endorphin concentrations in serum and FF do not differ between PCOS- and non PCOS-women undergoing IVF. However, together with sex hormones, beta endorphin might play a key role in oocyte maturation.Copyright Â© 2018, The Author(s).

N2  - In this study, we aimed to investigate serum and follicular fluid (FF) secreted frizzle-related protein-5 (Sfrp-5) levels in nonobese, nonhyperandrogenic patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF), in addition to IVF outcomes. In total, 160 patients undergoing IVF treatment were included in the study: 80 patients diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria (group I, study) and 80 patients with the etiology of male factor infertility (group II, control). There were statistically significant between-group differences in serum estradiol (E2) levels on the day of hCG administration (2377.00 +/- 733.23 vs. 1931.3 +/- 1,010.69), the total gonadotropin dose required (2000.63 +/- 1,051.87 vs. 1.134.69 +/- 286.45), and the total number of retrieved oocytes (8.60 +/- 2.06 vs. 11.05 +/- 4.39) (p < 0.05). There was also a statistically significant between-group difference in serum and FF Sfrp-5 levels on the day of oocyte retrieval (11.40 +/- 2.88 vs. 8.87 +/- 1.85, p < 0.001; 11.06 +/- 2.30 vs. 9.71 +/- 2.15, p = 0.008; respectively). However, there were no between-group differences in fertilization rates, clinical pregnancy rates, and live birth rates (p > 0.05). A correlation analysis showed that serum and FF Sfrp-5 levels were associated with insulin and inflammatory markers (p < 0.05). In a selected population of nonobese, nonhyperandrogenic PCOS patients, there was a significant difference in Sfrp-5 levels of the PCOS group versus those of the control group. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of Sfrp-5 in women with PCOS.Copyright Â© 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

N2  - The aim of this retrospective study was to examine how a low estradiol/follicle (E2/fol) may be related to in vitro fertilization/ intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI)-embryo transfer outcomes in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and non-PCOS patients, respectively. Between 2013 and 2017, 516 IVF/ICSI cycles (146 cycles in PCOS patients and 370 cycles in non-PCOS patients) with a long gonadotrophin releasing hormone receptor agonist protocol-including 338 involved fresh transfer cycles (89 cycles in PCOS patients and 249 cycles in non-PCOS patients)-were conducted. Outcomes were compared between 5 groups of PCOS patients defined by E2/fol (pg/mL) as follows: A, <140; B, 140 to 210; C, 210 to 280; D, 280 to 350; and E, >350. Non-PCOS patients' outcomes are grouped as well. Whether in PCOS or non-PCOS patients, those in the lowest E2/fol group (<140pg/mL) tended to be younger, and with a greater body mass index (BMI) and antral follicle count (AFC), than the patients in the other groups. Relative to the other groups, Group A showed a lower number and rate of oocytes, higher single pronucleus (1PN) and triple pronucleus (3PN) formation rate, early and advanced abortion rates, but these did not differ significantly from those of the other groups, it perhaps due to the limited sample size. Group A have a higher incidence of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome than the other groups in non-PCOS patients (P>.05). Whether in PCOS or non-PCOS patients, greater BMI, greater AFC, and younger age may favor the phenomenon of low E2/fol. In turn, low E2/fol may reduce the oocyte retrieval rate and increase the risk of 1PN and 3PN formation and abortion.Â© Copyright 2018 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Background: There is limited literature investigating the effects of body mass index (BMI) and androgen level on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-antagonist protocol in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Androgen-related variation in the effect of body mass index (BMI) on IVF outcomes remains unknown. Method(s): In this retrospective study, 583 infertile women with PCOS who underwent IVF using the conventional GnRH-antagonist protocol were included. Patients were divided into four groups according to BMI and androgen level: overweight- hyperandrogenism(HA) group, n = 96, overweight-non-HA group, n = 117, non-overweight-HA group, n = 152, and non-overweight-non-HA group, n = 218. Result(s): A significantly higher number of oocytes were retrieved, and the total Gn consumption as well Gn consumption per day was significantly lower, in the non-overweight groups than in the overweight groups. The number of available embryos was significantly higher in the HA groups than in the non-HA groups. Clinical pregnancy rate was of no significant difference among four groups. Live-birth rates in the overweight groups were significantly lower than those in non-overweight-non-HA group (23.9, 28.4% vs. 42.5%, P<0.05). The miscarriage rate in overweight-HA group was significantly higher than that in non-overweight-non-HA group (45.2% vs. 14.5%, P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that BMI and basal androstenedione (AND) both acted as significantly influent factors on miscarriage rate. The area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for BMI and basal AND on miscarriage rate were 0.607 (P = 0.029) and 0.657 (P = 0.001), respectively, and the cut-off values of BMI and basal AND were 25.335 kg/m2 and 10.95 nmol/L, respectively. Conclusion(s): In IVF cycles with GnRH-antagonist protocol, economic benefits were seen in non-overweight patients with PCOS, with less Gn cost and more retrieved oocytes. BMI and basal AND were both significantly influential factors with moderate predictive ability on the miscarriage rate. The predictive value of basal AND on miscarriage was slightly stronger than BMI.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: In vitro maturation (IVM) has some advantages over conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF), particularly in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) where the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation is high. We studied the live birth rate in a large series of PCOS women undergoing human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-priming IVM. Method(s): This retrospective study included women with PCOS aged 18-42 years undergoing IVM with hCG priming. We reported live birth rate after the first embryo transfer and cumulative live birth rate from embryos obtained in the IVM cycle. We also performed logistic regression to assess which factors predicted number of oocytes and live birth. Result(s): We included 921 women (age 28.9+/-3.5 years, body mass index 21.8+/-3.1 kg/m2, infertility duration 3.7+/-2.6 years, 81% primary infertility, 88% first IVF attempt, 94% ovulation induction failure). Live birth rate after the first embryo transfer was 31.7%, with a cumulative live birth rate from the cycle of 33.7%. High anti-Mullerian hormone levels predicted a high number of oocytes and a high oocyte maturation rate while the opposite was the case when luteinizing hormone levels were high. Conclusion(s): In women with PCOS, hCG priming IVM was feasible and resulted in acceptable live birth rates.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study is to examine the impact of female body mass index (BMI) on IVF cycle outcomes. Method(s): This is a retrospective cohort study including 51,198 women who initiated their first autologous IVF cycle in 13 fertility centers in the USA between 2009 and 2015. The effect of underweight, overweight, and obese BMI on four different IVF cycle outcomes (cycle cancellation, oocyte and embryo counts, and ongoing clinical pregnancy [OCP]) was evaluated in logistic or Poisson regression analyses with confounders adjusted. Result(s): Women with an overweight or obese BMI experienced worse outcomes than those with a normal BMI. These differences included (1) greater odds of cycle cancellation (aOR [95%CI] 1.17 [1.08, 1.26] for overweight, 1.28 [1.15, 1.41] for class-I obesity, and 1.50 [1.33, 1.68] for class-II/III obesity, P <.001 for all); (2) fewer oocytes retrieved (aIRR [95%CI] 0.98 [0.98,0.99] for class-I obesity, 0.93 [0.92,0.94] for class-II/III obesity, P <.001 for both); (3) fewer usable embryos (aIRR [95%CI] 0.98 [0.97,0.99] for overweight, 0.97 [0.96,0.99] for class-I obesity, 0.95 [0.93,0.97] for class-II/III obesity, P <.01 for all); and (4) lower odds of OCP (aOR [95%CI] 0.89 [0.83,0.95] for class-I obesity, 0.86 [0.79,0.93] for class-II/III obesity, P <.001 for both). In a subgroup analysis based on primary infertility diagnosis, these trends persisted in those with male or uterine factor and were especially pronounced in women with ovulatory dysfunction or PCOS. Conclusion(s): A BMI above the normal range was an independent negative prognostic factor for multiple outcomes, including cycle cancellation, oocyte and embryo counts, and OCP. These negative outcomes were most profound in women with class-II/III obesity, ovulatory dysfunction, or PCOS.Copyright Â© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Central obesity (CO) is a defining characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and PCOS-induced disorders are likely to be exacerbated in the presence of CO. This study aims to evaluate the impact of CO on infertile women with PCOS undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF).It is a retrospective and case-control study. One hundred eighty-eight infertile PCOS women undergoing IVF were divided into CO group (n = 70, waist circumference [WC] >=80 cm) and noncentral obesity (NCO) group (n = 118, WC <80 cm). Baseline characteristics, parameters of ovarian stimulation and laboratory, and pregnancy outcomes were compared between two groups. After controlling for body mass index (BMI), WC positively correlated with fasting insulin (r = 0.210, p = 0.007), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (r = 0.249, p = 0.006) and free androgen index (r = 0.249, p = 0.006). Compared with NCO group, CO group had significantly increased endocrine and metabolic disorders and needed significantly higher dose of gonadotropins, longer duration of ovarian stimulation (p < 0.05), but had significantly lower peak serum estradiol level (p < 0.01) and less oocytes retrieved (p = 0.032). CO group had significantly lower live birth and implantation rates (53.8% vs. 86.8%, p = 0.001; and 24.3% vs. 36.3%, p = 0.019, respectively) and higher early spontaneous miscarriage rate (38.5% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.002). For the multivariate analysis, by adjusting for age, BMI, insulin resistance, and hyperandrogenism (HA), CO was significantly independent risk factor for early miscarriage (adjusted relative ratio = 16.87, 95% confidence interval = 2.15-132.70, p = 0.007). CO is associated with insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and HA independent of BMI and is associated with poor pregnancy outcome in infertile women with PCOS undergoing IVF.Copyright Â© Yu Li et al. 2018.

N2  - Background: Overweight/obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are at increased risk of subfertility and complications of pregnancy, compared with normal-weight women. To implement controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), the improved efficacy of the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH-ant) protocol has been demonstrated, as well as frozen embryo transfer (FET). Objective(s): This retrospective study evaluated the pregnancy outcomes after combined GnRH-ant protocol and FET in overweight/obese women with PCOS, with reference to that of normal-weight women with PCOS. Method(s): Women with PCOS (n=398) who underwent the GnRH-ant protocol for COH followed by FET, were stratified as normal-weight (BMI <24 kg/m2) or overweight/obese (BMI >=24 kg/m2). The outcomes of pregnancy were compared. Result(s): The overweight/obese patients had significantly lower rates of embryo implantation (47.7%), live birth (47.8%), and live births of twins (10.9%) compared with the normal-weight group (58.4%, 60.8%, and 30.0%, respectively; P=0.006, 0.015, and 0.000), while the rate of late abortion was significantly higher (11.0% cf. 3.8%, P=0.030). BMI was the only significant factor affecting the probability of live birth. Conclusion(s): The pregnancy outcomes of overweight/obese women with PCOS after COH via the GnRH-ant protocol and FET remained at a significant deficit compared with that of normal-weight women with PCOS.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - STUDY QUESTION Would letrozole as a primary ovulation induction agent generate better pregnancy rates than clomiphene citrate (CC) in subfertile women with anovulatory polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)? SUMMARY ANSWER Participants receiving letrozole as a primary treatment achieved a significantly (P = 0.022) higher clinical pregnancy rate per patient (61.2%) compared to CC (43.0%). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY According to a recent Cochrane systematic review (2014), letrozole appears to improve live-birth (LB) and pregnancy rates in anovulatory women with PCOS, compared to CC. However, the review concluded that the quality of evidence was low due to poor reporting of study methods and possible publication bias. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) included 159 participants between April 2007 and June 2014. Subjects were randomly allocated to either CC (n = 79) or letrozole (n = 80) in a 1:1 ratio. Both drugs were encapsulated to look identical. Randomization was performed in mixed blocks and stratified by patients' BMI (<30 and 30-35 kg/m 2). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS The trial included subfertile women diagnosed with PCOS. Treatment started with one tablet (CC 50 mg, letrozole 2.5 mg) increasing to two in non-responders and continuing until pregnancy or for up to six ovulatory cycles. Non-responders were crossed over to the other treatment after a 6-week break. Cycles were initially monitored with ultrasound follicle tracking then mid-luteal serum progesterone measurement in subsequent cycles. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Amongst the 159 participants included in the intention-to-treat analysis, four women conceived before treatment and six were lost-to-follow-up. The remaining 149 participants (74 on CC and 75 on letrozole) completed at least the first treatment. Women receiving letrozole achieved a significantly (P = 0.022; absolute difference [95% confidence interval] 18% [3-33%]) higher pregnancy rate (61.%) than those on CC (43%). The median number of treatment cycles received until pregnancy was significantly (log rank P = 0.038) smaller with letrozole (4[3-5] cycles) compared to CC (6[4-7] cycles). LB rates were not statistically (P = 0.089) different between the two groups, although there was a trend towards higher rates on letrozole (48.8%) compared to CC (35.4%). After the crossover, pregnancy and LB rates on letrozole (n = 45; 28.9 and 24.4%, respectively) were not statistically (P = 0.539 and P = 0.601) different from CC (n = 31; 22.6 and 19.4%). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION One possible limitation of this trial may be the exclusion of PCOS women with BMI > 35 kg/m 2, which would limit the applicability of the results in this subgroup of PCOS. However, this group of women are generally excluded from treatment in the majority of fertility centres, especially in Europe, due to the associated challenges and risks. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The results of this trial are consistent with the recent Cochrane systematic review. However, with its robust design, the current RCT provides more valid and compelling evidence for the superiority of letrozole over CC as a primary ovulation induction agent in PCOS women with 40% increase in pregnancy rates and with a shorter time-to-pregnancy. Furthermore, the participants in this RCT are a good representation of subfertile PCOS population receiving fertility treatment in Europe and worldwide. The results are therefore globally generalizable for clinical practice. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S) This RCT was mainly funded by the R&D Funding Scheme of Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The study also received funds from School of Medicine, University of Nottingham. The Trust R&D department was involved in the development of the protocol and the running of the trial. The trial was sponsored and monitored by the University of Nottingham. The authors have no conflicts of interest. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER www.Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00478504.

N2  - Background and aim: There are still open questions about ovulation induction in clomiphene citrate-(CC)-resistant infertile women. Especially little is known about efficacy and safety of letrozole (LTZ) combined with low-dose highly purified human menopausal gonadotropin (Hp-HMG) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): Prospective, single-arm single-center trial in 200 infertile PCOS patients refractory for at least three CC-treatment cycles. Women with hyperandrogenism took Diane-35 for at least 3 months. All patients got LTZ on day 3 for 5 d in combination with Hp-HMG, starting with 75 IU from cycle day 7 and maintained for up to 3 d. The maximum dose was 150 IU. Primary end-points were ongoing and clinical pregnancy rate, secondary end-points mono-follicular development, ovulation rate, OHSS, multiple pregnancy and early pregnancy loss. Major safety end-point was the incidence of adverse events. Result(s): Within 395 cycles the ongoing pregnancy rate was 28.24%, for cycles 35.23%, for patients 68%. The rate of ovulation per cycle was 97.7%, percentage of mono-follicular development 70.9%. No severe OHSS, multiple pregnancy, local or systemic side effects were seen. Conclusion(s): LTZ combined with low-dose Hp-HMG is an effective and safe choice for reducing hyperstimulation and increasing pregnancy rate in CC-resistant women with PCOS.Copyright Â© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Purpose To provide insights into the correlation among lipid metabolism, cytokine profiles in the follicular fluid (FF) and embryo quality of women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) with metabolic syndrome (MS). Methods Ninety women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment were recruited, including 60 PCOS patients (PCOS non MS and PCOS MS) and 30 age-matched controls. Individual FF samples were analyzed using the cytometric multiplex immunoassay. Results In the FF, the PCOS MS group was associated with higher, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations compared with that in the control group (P < 0.05). The FF tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) level in the PCOS MS group was 3.89 +/- 1.18 ng/mL, which was significantly higher compared with the control (2.94 +/- 1.02 ng/mL) and PCOS non-MS groups (3.05 +/- 1.21 ng/mL) (P = 0.002), while the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) level in the PCOS MS group (4.18 +/- 1.33 ng/mL) was lower compared with the control (5.61 +/- 1.82 ng/mL) and PCOS non-MS groups (5.32 +/- 1.91 ng/mL) (P = 0.004). The FF G-CSF showed a trend toward negative relationship with TG and TC; TNF-alpha concentration was positively associated with TG. The percentage of top-quality embryo decreased in the PCOS MS group than in the other two groups (20% vs. 38.4% and 34.6%). Conclusions In conclusion, there was an elevated lipolysis condition within the FF of PCOS MS patients and the TNF-alpha and G-CSF levels in FF were associated with top-quality embryo percentage. TNF-alpha and G-CSF may be the key cytokines involved in the mechanism of decreased embryo development potential in PCOS MS patients.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - To compare the therapeutic efficacy of clomiphene citrate (CC) and letrozole (LE) on ovulation, pregnancy, and live birth in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); and to ensure if LE can replace CC as the first-line therapy for ovulation induction in these women. This is a prospectively, randomized, controlled trial in the tertiary hospital. Two-hundred and sixty-eight anovulatory PCOS patients were treated by CC or CC plus metformin and LE or LE plus metformin for three continuous cycles or conception; their ovulation rates, pregnancy rates, and live birth rates were calculated and compared. No significant difference was noted among the four groups regarding to the baseline data of clinical manifestations, serum sex hormone levels, and serum insulin levels. A total of 240 patients completed the therapies. The ovulation rate was significantly higher in the group LE than the group CC; however, no significant difference was noted between the groups LE and CC, CC, and CC + MET, or LE and LE + MET in the pregnancy rate, abortion rate, and live birth rate. No birth defect was found in the total of 63 newborns. CC regimen was still recommended to be the first-line therapy of ovulation induction for PCOS.Copyright Â© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of the present study is to explore the influence of body mass index (BMI) on outcomes of in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) techniques in Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study that enrolled 800 subjects with PCOS from nine hospitals in China. Patients were categorized according to BMI categories: underweight, <18.5 kg/m2; normal, 19-23.9 kg/m2; overweight, 24-27.9 kg/m2; and obese, >=28 kg/m2. Total recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) dose used, estradiol, and progesterone levels on human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) day; implantation rate; and biochemical, clinical, and ongoing pregnancy rates were compared among BMI categories. Hormone levels (estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), LH, testosterone, and progesterone) were measured using electrochemiluminescence assays. Result(s): Among the 774 subjects, 27.3 % were overweight and 8.1 % were obese. The rFSH dose used differed significantly among BMI categories (P < 0.001). The implantation rate was lower in obese subjects than that in normal-weight subjects (25.3 vs 45.7 %). Clinical pregnancy rate per transfer differed among BMI categories (P = 0.033), but there was no difference for biochemical (P = 0.327) and ongoing (P = 0.084) pregnancy rates. The miscarriage rate was similar among BMI categories. Conclusion(s): More than one third of Chinese women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI are overweight or obese. Elevated BMI is associated with reduced clinical pregnancy rate but similar ongoing pregnancy rates, suggesting that BMI has little impact on IVF outcomes.Copyright Â© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: Does 'metformin' reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) undergoing a GnRH antagonist assisted conception treatment cycle? SUMMARY ANSWER: A short course of metformin does not reduce the incidence of OHSS for women with PCOS undergoing a GnRH antagonist treatment cycle. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Metformin does reduce the incidence of OHSS in a GnRH-Agonist treatment cycle. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A randomised placebo-controlled trial (RCT) using metformin or placebo. Randomisation was blinded to both patient and investigator, using a random permuted blocks method with a 50:50 allocation ratio. The study was completed over 5 years (2009-2014) with 153 randomised patients. A sample size calculation based on the incidence of OHSS was completed prospectively suggesting a minimum of 146 recruits was required for the trial with a power of 80% and a type 1 error of 0.05. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All patients met the Rotterdam criteria for PCOS and were treated with a standard GnRH antagonist IVF/ICSI treatment cycle in a tertiary infertility clinic. The study medication was started prior to stimulation and continued to oocyte retrieval. Of the 153 patients, 77 received metformin and 76 placebo. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: There was no reduction in the incidence of moderate-severe OHSS (Placebo (PLA) 12.2%, metformin (MET) = 16%, 95% CI -0.08-0.16, P = 0.66). There was no difference in total gonadotrophin dose (PLA = 1200, MET = 1200, 95% CI -118.67-118.67, P = 0.75), oocytes retrieved (PLA = 15, MET = 14, 95% CI -2.37-4.37, P = 0.66) or fertilisation rate (PLA = 60.7%, MET = 53.3%, 95% CI -0.96-14.94, P = 0.07). However, using metformin resulted in a reduced clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) per cycle started (PLA = 48.7%, MET = 28.6%, 95% CI 0.04-0.35, P = 0.02) and live birth rate (PLA = 51.6%, MET = 27.6%, 95% CI 0.05-0.40, P = 0.02). Furthermore, when ethnicity was taken into account there was a significant reduction in pregnancy outcome for the South Asian population irrespective of metformin or placebo use (CPR per cycle started,White Caucasian = 44.4%, South Asian = 19.4%; 95% CI 0.06-0.39, P = 0.01). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was only undertaken on an infertility population with PCOS with a limited duration of study medication use. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first adequately powered RCT to assess the impact of metformin on OHSS in a high-risk group (women with PCOS) undergoing a GnRH antagonist cycle. It does not support the empirical prescribing of metformin as an adjunct to a GnRH antagonist treatment cycle.Copyright Â© The Author 2016.

N2  - Objective To evaluate outcomes of in vitro fertilization (IVF) among patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by age. Methods In a retrospective study, data were retrieved for patients with PCOS (Rotterdam 2003 criteria) and individuals with tubal factor infertility who underwent IVF at a center in Seoul, South Korea, between January 2003 and August 2012. IVF outcomes were compared by age group (A: 30-32 years; B: 33-35 years; C: 36-38 years; D: 39-41 years). Results The analysis included 307 women with PCOS and 364 with tubal factor infertility. There was a significant difference between women with PCOS and those with tubal infertility factor in the live birth rate in group B (41.3% vs 28.6%, P = 0.038) and in group C (40.4% vs 15.1%, P = 0.002). Among women with PCOS, no significant differences in number of retrieved oocytes were observed between the age groups (18.8 +/- 9.6, 19.1 +/- 10.0, 17.7 +/- 7.5, and 17.0 +/- 13.8). However, the clinical pregnancy rate was significantly lower in group D than in group C (47.2% vs 18.8%, P = 0.042). Conclusion Fertility in patients with PCOS was maintained until age 38 years using IVF. Thereafter, the pregnancy rate decreased, although the number of oocytes retrieved by IVF remained stable.Copyright Â© 2016 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics

N2  - This study aims to demonstrate the possible relationship between the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system and early miscarriage in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients with euploid embryos. 40 pregnant women included. 9 had PCOS and miscarried; 20 had PCOS and a successful ongoing pregnancy; the remaining 11 women did not have PCOS and miscarried. An ultrasound scan was performed to prove clinical pregnancy and a blood sample was taken on day 55 +/- 4 of gestation. Serum samples of IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), total testosterone, serum hormone binding protein (SHBG), leptin and soluble leptin receptor (sOb-R) were obtained. In miscarriages, samples of decidua were obtained during vaccum curettage. Embryonic chromosomes in all miscarriages were proven to be normal. The expression of IGF-1, IGFBP-1, leptin, long-form leptin receptor and androge sOb-R n receptor (AR) were examined in the decidua. We found that miscarried PCOS patients showed significantly increased free androgen index and free IGF index, as well as decreased SHBG and IGFBP-1 than other two groups in peripheral blood. In the decidua, miscarried PCOS patients showed significantly increased expression of IGF-1 and decreased IGFBP-1 when compared with non-PCOS. AR was not expressed in the decidua of either group. Our results suggest that early miscarriage is associated with increased IGF-1 and decreased IGFBP-1 in PCOS patients.Copyright Â© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Objective: To investigate the inflammatory markers in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and associations of these markers with obesity and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. Method(s): A total of 292 women underwent IVF procedure either with PCOS (n = 146) or without PCOS (n = 146, age, and body mass index (BMI) matched controls) were included in the study. All patients were classified according to BMI levels (normal weight: NW, BMI <25 kg/m2 and obese: OB, BMI >=25 kg/m2). The inflammatory markers were leukocyte count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), mean platelet volume (MPV). Result(s): BMI of PCOS was positively correlated with leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte and MPV (p < 0.05), but negatively correlated with NLR and PLR (p < 0.05). Both NLR and PLR increased significantly in PCOS (p < 0.001). PLR increased significantly in NW-PCOS compared the NW-controls and OB-PCOS. MPV values increased only in OB-PCOS subjects. The logistic regression analyzes showed that MPV was the independent variable in PCOS to effect CPR (p = 0.000; OR 0.1; CI 0.06-0.2). Conclusion(s): NLR and PLR were significantly increased in all PCOS subjects compared to the BMI-matched controls. Despite PLR being decreased by adiposity, PLR increased in NW-PCOS. These results are supporting the hypothesis that PCOS is a chronic inflammatory process independent of obesity. MPV levels were independently associated with CPR in PCOS. Further prospective studies concerning inflammation and IVF outcomes of PCOS are needed.Copyright Â© 2016, Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate age-related variations in the effect of body mass index (BMI) on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a cohort study conducted by retrospectively investigating the IVF cycles of 653 polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients under the age of 40 years who were diagnosed based on the Rotterdam criteria in a private IVF clinic between 2005 and 2015. The study included data from 653 IVF cycles of PCOS patients. The patients were classified into three groups based on their BMI, i.e., normal weight (n=299), overweight (n=208), and obese (n=146). The patients were also grouped by age: 562 patients were under the age of 35 years and 91 patients were above the age of 35 years. Then, BMI- and age-related variations in the IVF cycle parameters and clinical pregnancy rates of patients with PCOS were investigated. The Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square statistical assessment method was used to determine whether the effect of BMI on IVF outcomes varies with age. Result(s): Variations in cycle variables with BMI and age showed that IVF cycles were negatively affected by increases in obesity and age. Clinical pregnancy rates were found to be lower in the obese group than in the other groups, particularly in the age group above 35 years; however, this difference could not be proven statistically. Conclusion(s): The present study evaluated obesity and clinical pregnancy rates in IVF cycles in PCOS patients according to age groups, and particularly in the obese group, the clinical pregnancy rates were observed to be lower in the age group >=35 years than in the other BMI groups; however, this difference was found to be statistically insignificant.Copyright Â© 2016 by the Turkish-German Gynecological Education and Research Foundation.

N2  - Objective To examine the effect of body mass index (BMI) on IVF outcomes in fresh autologous cycles. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Not applicable. Patient(s) A total of 239,127 fresh IVF cycles from the 2008-2010 Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology registry were stratified into cohorts based on World Health Organization BMI guidelines. Cycles reporting normal BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m2) were used as the reference group (REF). Subanalyses were performed on cycles reporting purely polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-related infertility and those with purely male-factor infertility (34,137 and 89,354 cycles, respectively). Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, pregnancy loss rate, and live birth rate. Result(s) Success rates and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all pregnancy outcomes were most favorable in cohorts with low and normal BMIs and progressively worsened as BMI increased. Obesity also had a negative impact on IVF outcomes in cycles performed for PCOS and male-factor infertility, although it did not always reach statistical significance. Conclusion(s) Success rates in fresh autologous cycles, including those done for specifically PCOS or male-factor infertility, are highest in those with low and normal BMIs. Furthermore, there is a progressive and statistically significant worsening of outcomes in groups with higher BMIs. More research is needed to determine the causes and extent of the influence of BMI on IVF success rates in other patient populations.Copyright Â© 2016 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Purpose: This study aimed at evaluating the effects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and body mass index (BMI) on follicular fluid (FF) adiponectin and ghrelin levels, and on in vitro fertilization outcomes in patients who underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Method(s): This prospective cross-sectional study was performed with a total of 120 primary infertile women [group 1; non-PCOS = 60 (BMI <25 = 30, BMI >=25 = 30) and group 2; PCOS = 60 (BMI <25 = 30, BMI >=25 = 30)]. On the day of oocyte pickup, FF samples were collected. Result(s): The FF adiponectin levels were lower in the lean PCOS group than the lean non-PCOS group (p = 0.001), and these levels were lower in the overweight non-PCOS group compared to lean non-PCOS group (0.001). However, there was no difference in the FF ghrelin levels between the groups. Additionally, we could not find a relationship between clinical pregnancy and adiponectin and ghrelin levels. Conclusion(s): The FF adiponectin and ghrelin levels have no effects on clinical pregnancy in PCOS. Therefore, further studies are needed to elucidate this issue.Copyright Â© 2015 Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).

N2  - Aim: To compare clomiphene citrate (CC), metformin or the combination of CC and metformin as the first line ovulation induction drug in Asian Indian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): One hundred and five newly diagnosed, treatment naive PCOS women were recruited. They were randomized into any of the three groups: Group I (CC 50-150 mg/day), Group II (metformin 1700 mg/day), and Group III (CC + metformin in similar dosage to Groups I and II). Patients underwent follicular monitoring and advice on timed intercourse. The study period was 6 months, or till pregnant, or till CC resistant. Primary outcome studied was live birth rate (LBR). Secondary outcomes were ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, and early pregnancy loss rate. Result(s): There was no significant difference among the groups in baseline characteristics and biochemical parameters. LBR was 41.6%, 37.5%, and 28.1%, respectively in Groups III, II, and I. Group III (CC + metformin) had the highest ovulation (83.3%), pregnancy (50%), and LBRs (41.6%). Group II (metformin) was as good as Group I (CC) in all the outcomes. CC + metformin (Group III) had statistically significantly higher ovulation rate as compared to CC alone (Group I) (P = 0.03; odds ratio: 95% confidence interval: 3.888 [1.08-13.997]). Conclusion(s): Thus, our study shows that metformin was as good as CC in terms of >>LBR>> and the combination of CC and metformin gave the highest ovulation and LBR.Copyright Â© 2015 Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences-Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

N2  - Objective: To determine if body mass index has an effect on the outcome of in vitro fertilization in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation., Material and Methods: The study included 337 cycles. Patients were stratified into the following 3 groups: normal weight, overweight, and obese. The primary outcome measures were response to ovarian hyperstimulation, the fertilization rate, the implantation rate, and the clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates., Results: Total gonadotropin consumption increased, and the number of retrieved oocytes decreased as the body mass index increased. The implantation rate and clinical pregnancy rate were similar in all 3 groups. In response to the mid-luteal long protocol, the cycle cancellation rate was lower and the number of retrieved oocytes was higher in the overweight and obese groups, as compared to the antagonist protocol., Conclusion: The body mass index did not affect the outcome of in vitro fertilization in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Additional research is required to better understand the role of stimulation protocols on the cycle outcome.Copyright Â© 2014 by the Turkish-German Gynecological Education and Research Foundation.

N2  - Objective The objective of the investigation was to study the effect of body mass index (BMI) on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes within a polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) population. Study Design This was a retrospective cohort study including 101 cycles from 79 women younger than 40 years old with a clinically documented diagnosis of PCOS by Rotterdam criteria undergoing IVF at a university-based infertility clinic from 2001 through 2010. All participants were stratified by BMI calculated from height and weight recorded within 3 months of cycle start: lean (18.7-24.9 kg/m2, n = 51), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2, n = 19), and obese (30 kg/m 2, n = 31). Linear, logistic, and Poisson regressions were used as appropriate to estimate the effect of a range of BMIs on IVF outcomes while adjusting for potential confounders. Results Obese PCOS women had 69% lower odds of clinical pregnancy per cycle start (odds ratio [OR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.86; P =.02) and 77% lower odds of clinical pregnancy per embryo transfer (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.68; P =.008) compared with lean PCOS women. Among obese PCOS women, the odds of live birth were 71% lower per cycle start (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10-0.84; P =.02) and 77% lower per embryo transfer (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07-0.71; P =.01) compared with lean PCOS women. There was a trend toward decreased ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome incidence with increasing BMI among women with PCOS: 19.6% in lean, 10.5% in overweight, and 3.2% in obese. Conclusion PCOS is a broad syndrome, with our results demonstrating 2 distinct populations, lean and obese, which have different IVF outcomes including ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome risk profiles. This information is important for clinicians because it informs treatment decisions. Â© 2014 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous endocrine disorder frequently accompanied by obesity and by insulin resistance, and patients with this syndrome suffer from infertility and poor pregnancy outcome. Disturbances in plasma amino acid (AA) metabolism have been implicated in women with PCOS. However, direct evidence on follicular AA metabolic profiles in PCOS patients and their relationship with pregnancy outcome is sparse. Method(s): We conducted a prospective study in 63 PCOS patients and 48 controls in the Division of Reproductive Center, Peking University Third Hospital. Follicular AA levels were measured by the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method, and the results were analyzed based on different grouping criteria. Result(s): The levels of aromatic amino acid (AAA) increased in PCOS patients independent of obesity (P < 0.05), whereas the levels of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), glutamic acid, phenylalanine, alanine, and arginine increased with body mass index irrespective of the PCOS status (all P < 0.05). In addition, compared with non insulin resistant-PCOS patients and controls, insulin resistant-PCOS group had higher levels of leucine, valine and glutamic acid (all P < 0.05). In PCOS group, aspartic acid and serine levels were elevated in pregnant patients compared with the non-pregnant subjects (both P < 0.05). Moreover, the levels of BCAA and valine were higher in the non-pregnant group than in the pregnant group (both P < 0.05). The pregnancy rate (45.00%) of subjects with elevated BCAA level was significantly lower than that (66.67%) in control subjects (P = 0.036) at a BCAA cutoff value of 239.10 muM, while the abortion rate was much higher (33.33% versus 2.78%, P = 0.004). Conclusion(s): Both PCOS and obesity were accompanied by follicular AA metabolic disturbances, with obesity exerting a more pronounced effect on AA metabolic profiles. The disruptions in specific AAs in the follicular fluid might account for the inferior pregnancy outcome in obese patients and increased risk of abortion in PCOS patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Clomiphene is the current first-line infertility treatment in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome, but aromatase inhibitors, including letrozole, might result in better pregnancy outcomes. METHOD(S): In this double-blind, multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 750 women, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive letrozole or clomiphene for up to five treatment cycles, with visits to determine ovulation and pregnancy, followed by tracking of pregnancies. The polycystic ovary syndrome was defined according to modified Rotterdam criteria (anovulation with either hyperandrogenism or polycystic ovaries). Participants were 18 to 40 years of age, had at least one patent fallopian tube and a normal uterine cavity, and had a male partner with a sperm concentration of at least 14 million per milliliter; the women and their partners agreed to have regular intercourse with the intent of conception during the study. The primary outcome was live birth during the treatment period. RESULT(S): Women who received letrozole had more cumulative live births than those who received clomiphene (103 of 374 [27.5%] vs. 72 of 376 [19.1%], P=0.007; rate ratio for live birth, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 1.87) without significant differences in overall congenital anomalies, though there were four major congenital anomalies in the letrozole group versus one in the clomiphene group (P=0.65). The cumulative ovulation rate was higher with letrozole than with clomiphene (834 of 1352 treatment cycles [61.7%] vs. 688 of 1425 treatment cycles [48.3%], P<0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in pregnancy loss (49 of 154 pregnancies in the letrozole group [31.8%] and 30 of 103 pregnancies in the clomiphene group [29.1%]) or twin pregnancy (3.4% and 7.4%, respectively). Clomiphene was associated with a higher incidence of hot flushes, and letrozole was associated with higher incidences of fatigue and dizziness. Rates of other adverse events were similar in the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION(S): As compared with clomiphene, letrozole was associated with higher live-birth and ovulation rates among infertile women with the polycystic ovary syndrome.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of clomiphene citrate [CC] co-administration during the use of exogenous low-dose urinary FSH [uFSH] for induction of ovulation in CC-resistant infertile PCOS women. Method(s): In a randomised controlled setting, 174 CC-resistant infertile PCOS women were randomized into two parallel groups; Group I received CC 100 mg/day for 5 days plus uFSH 37.5 IU/day while group II received only uFSH 37.5 IU /day. Subsequent increments of uFSH by 37.5 IU/day were made according to response. Primary outcome was ovulation rate. Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy rates, number of follicles, endometrial thickness, and gonadotropins consumption. Result(s): Our results have demonstrated that group I compared to group II had significantly higher ovulation rate per intention to treat [ITT] [72.4 % vs. 34.2 %, p < 0.001]. Clinical pregnancy and live birth rates were comparable between the two groups. Group I consumed significantly lower total FSH dose and needed significantly shorter stimulation duration compared to group II. Conclusion(s): CC co-administered during low dose HP uFSH versus uFSH for CC-resistant PCOS yields significantly higher ovulation rate and less consumption of FSH.

N2  - Objective: We sought to assess the association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and ectopic pregnancy after in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (ET). Study Design: In this retrospective cohort study, we included 5339 women who had clinical pregnancies after in vitro fertilization treatment (PCOS, 205 women; non-PCOS, 5134 women) at Nanjing Medical University (China) between 2007 and 2011. Fresh and cryo-thawed ET cycles were analyzed respectively. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of ectopic pregnancy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for important confounders. Result(s): In fresh ET cycles of women who were undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH; n = 3303), women with PCOS had 3.06 times higher risk of ectopic pregnancy compared with those without PCOS (7.0% vs 2.4%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-6.96). In the stratified analysis, for women without PCOS, the high estradiol group (>4085 pg/mL) had higher ectopic pregnancy rates compared with the low estradiol group (<=4085 pg/mL; 3.4% vs 2.0%; aOR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.19-3.35); however, for women with PCOS, both high and low estradiol groups had high ectopic pregnancy rates (5.6% vs 7.7%; aOR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.15-5.67). In cryo-thawed ET cycles without COH (n = 2036), the ectopic rates between women with and without PCOS were similar (2.2% vs 2.0%; aOR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.22-4.07). Conclusion(s): PCOS was associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy after COH in fresh ET cycles, but not in cryo-thawed ET cycles. A possible explanation is that, compared with women without PCOS, women with PCOS appear to hold a lower threshold of hyperphysiologic estradiol level that triggers the occurrence of ectopic pregnancy after COH.

N2  - Context: Elevated serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) concentration in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is known to lower sensitivity of ovarian follicles to circulating FSH. This effect may compromise the outcome of clomiphene citrate (CC) ovulation induction. Objective(s): The objective of the study was to investigate the impact of high circulating AMH on the outcome of CC ovulation induction in women with PCOS. Design(s): This was a prospective cohort observational study. Setting(s): The study was conducted at the Fertility Unit, Derby, United Kingdom. Patient(s): Sixty anovulatory women with PCOS participated in the study. Intervention(s): Serum AMH concentrations were measured on cycle day 2 during 187 CC cycles. These concentrations were compared between responders and nonresponders. The receiver-operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the prognostic value of circulating AMH. The success rates of CC were compared between patients with high vs low AMH levels. The dose of CC required to achieve ovulation was correlated with serum AMH concentrations. Main Outcome Measure(s): Ovulation and pregnancy rates were measured. Result(s): Serum AMH concentrations were significantly (P <.001) lower in responders (achieving ovulation) vs nonresponders (mean +/- SEM, 2.5 +/- 0.1 vs 5.8 +/- 0.7 ng/mL, respectively). Similarly, serum AMH concentrations were significantly (P =.046) lower in pregnant (3.0 +/- 0.4 ng/mL) vs nonpregnant patients (4.4 +/-0.5 ng/mL). There was a significant (P =.02) gradient increase of serum AMH levels with the increasing dose of CC required to achieve ovulation. The receiver-operating characteristic curve showed AMH to be a useful predictor of no ovulation (area under the curve, 0.809; P <.001) with a useful cutoff level of 3.4 ng/mL. Ovulation and pregnancy rates were significantly higher (97%, P <.001, and 46%, P =.034) in patients with low AMH (<3.4 ng/mL) vs women with AMH 3.4 ng/mL or greater (48% and 19%). Conclusion(s): PCOS women with high circulating AMH (>;3.4 ng/mL) seem to be resistant to CC and may require a higher starting dose. Copyright Â© 2013 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - Aim: The objective of this study was to explore the result of pretreatment and concomitant use of metformin with clomiphene citrate (CC) and rFSH for ovulation induction in clomiphene-citrate-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Material(s) and Method(s): This randomized controlled trial was done in the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital and the Infertility Care and Research Centre, Dhaka, Bangladesh. A total of 165 infertile patients with CC-resistant PCOS who attended for treatment were the target population for this study. Patients were divided into three groups: groupsA and B were given metformin and group C was the control. Along with metformin, group A received CC and group B received rFSH. Group C was treated with only rFSH. Metformin was given 1500 mg daily for 4 weeks. Afterwards CC or rFSH were added for induction of ovulation along with metformin. Six ovulatory cycles were assessed. Treatment was terminated when there was no response with maximum dose of CC and rFSH or after six ovulatory cycles without pregnancy or after achieving pregnancy. A P-value of <0.5 was considered as significant. Result(s): Ovulation (89.09%) and pregnancy (54.55%) rates were higher in group B. Ovulation (74.55%) and pregnancy (29.09%) rates were also satisfactory in group C but a dose of rFSH requirement was significantly higher (P = 0.000). In group A, both ovulation and pregnancy rate were much lower than the other two groups (27.27% and 12.73%, respectively). Conclusion(s): Use of metformin increases the response of ovulation-inducing agents and can be used safely in PCOS. Â© 2013 The Authors.

N2  - Objective: To assess whether women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) follow the same age-related decline in IVF outcomes as women with tubal factor infertility over the reproductive life span. PCOS is characterized by increased ovarian reserve as assessed by antral follicle counts and anti-Mullerian hormone levels. It is unclear whether these surrogate markers of ovarian reserve reflect a true lengthening of the reproductive window. Design(s): Retrospective cohort. Setting(s): Not applicable. Patient(s): Women with PCOS and tubal factor infertility (42,286 cycles). Intervention(s): IVF. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pregnancy and live-birth rates. Result(s): The mean number of oocytes retrieved was higher in women with PCOS compared with in women with tubal factor (16.4 vs. 12.8; odds ratio [OR], 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-1.29). The clinical pregnancy (42.5% vs. 35.8%; OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.27-1.38) and live-birth rates were also increased in women with PCOS (34.8% vs. 29.1%; OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.24-1.35). A similar rate of decline in clinical pregnancy and live-birth rates was noted in both groups (20-44 years). The implantation, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and live-birth rates were not significantly different for each year after age 40 in the two groups. Conclusion(s): Despite a higher oocyte yield in all age groups, women with PCOS over age 40 had similar clinical pregnancy and live-birth rates compared with women with tubal factor infertility. These findings suggest that the reproductive window may not be extended in PCOS and that patients with infertility should be treated in a timely manner despite indicators of high ovarian reserve.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Introduction: AMH, is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) produced by granulosa cells with the highest expression being in small antral follicles. Our objective is to evaluate the predictive value of follicular AMH levels as an indicator of IVF outcomes in PCOS patients. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 63 patients undergoing the IVF trail were recruited for this prospective case-control study. The patients were classified into three groups: Group I: 43 patients with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Group II: 20 normo-ovulatory patients were recruited for the IVF trail because of the male infertility factor (control group). Group III: consists of 33 patients from group I recruited to determine the effect of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) on serum AMH levels. Serum AMH levels were performed on day 3 of the menstrual cycle whereas the follicular fluid AMH level has been evaluated at the time of oocyte retrieval by enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay (AMH Gen II ELISA kit, Beckman Coulter, Inc. USA). AMH concentrations were adjusted to its protein content, to avoid possible bias due to FF volume variability. The relationship between follicular fluid AMH (FF AMH) levels and the number of oocytes retrieved, number of mature oocytes, number of embryos, fertilization and clinical pregnancy rate were assessed. The demographic data were similar between two groups as regards age and BMI. Result(s): Both serum AMH levels and FF AMH levels were significantly higher in PCOS patients than in the controls, the values for serum levels were (5.07 +/- 3.39 ng/ml, 3.07 +/- 2.09 ng/ml) respectively and for follicular fluid levels were (67 +/- 50.7 ng/g, 38.5 +/- 44.4 ng/g) respectively. Serum AMH levels showed a positive correlation with oocytes retrieved and mature oocyte number, but there was no significant correlation with good quality embryo number, fertilization rate or clinical pregnancy rate in PCOS patients. On the other hand FF AMH levels do not show correlation with any of the IVF outcomes mentioned above in PCOS patients. Interestingly, the interval change in serum AMH levels between baseline AMH levels and levels after COH had a significant predictive value of pregnancy. Conclusion(s): Serum AMH levels can predict the number of the retrieved oocytes and mature oocytes, whereas FF AMH may not be a valuable predictor for IVF outcomes in PCOS patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Clomifene citrate (CC) is accepted as the first-line method for ovulation induction (OI) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) associated with infertility owing to anovulation. Low-dose FSH has been reserved for women failing to conceive with CC. In this RCT, we tested the hypothesis that pregnancy rate (PR) and live birth rates (LBR) are higher after OI with low-dose FSH than with CC as first-line treatment. METHOD(S): Infertile women (<40 years old) with PCOS-related anovulation, without prior OI treatment, attending 10 centres in Europe/South America were randomized to OI with either CC (50-150 mg/day for 5 days) or FSH (starting dose 50 IU) for up to three treatment cycles. The primary outcome was clinical PR. RESULT(S): Patients (n = 302) were randomized to OI with FSH (n = 132 women; 288 cycles) or CC (n = 123; 310 cycles). Per protocol analysis revealed that reproductive outcome was superior after OI with FSH than with CC with respect to PR per first cycle [30 versus 14.6%, respectively, 95 confidence interval (CI) 5.3-25.8, P = 0.003], PR per woman, (58 versus 44% of women, 95% CI 1.5-25.8, P = 0.03), LBR per woman (52 versus 39%, 95% CI 0.4-24.6, P = 0.04), cumulative PR (52.1 versus 41.2%, P = 0.021) and cumulative LBR (47.4 versus 36.9%, P = 0.031), within three cycles of OI. CONCLUSION(S): Pregnancies and live births are achieved more effectively and faster after OI with low-dose FSH than with CC. This result has to be balanced by convenience and cost in favour of CC. FSH may be an appropriate first-line treatment for some women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, particularly older patients. Â© The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.

N2  - Objectives The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of letrozole versus clomiphene citrate as an ovulation induction drug in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients of Indian origin. Method One hundred and forty seven infertile PCOS patients were randomly given letrozole (2.5 mg) (n = 69) or clomiphene (100 mg) (n = 78) from day 3 to day 7 of menstrual cycle, followed-up with transvaginal serial folliculometry from day 9. 10,000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was administered when at least 1 ovarian follicle was C 18 mm in size. Results The pertinent results of the study are as follows: on the day of hCG injection, mean E2 level was significantly higher in the clomphene citrate group (817 +/- 286.70 pg/ml) in comparison with letrozole group (444.03 +/- 85.42 pg/ml). Mean endometrial development was 8.72 +/- 1.41 mm in the letrozole and 8.78 +/- 1.16 mm in the clomiphene group (P = 0.004). Conclusion Letrozole has beneficial effect on endometrium, thereby potentially increasing pregnancy rates after successful ovulation induction in women with PCOS. Â© Springer-Verlag 2011.

N2  - The study aim was to evaluate our personal experience regarding the use and the reproductive effect of metformin administration in a large population of infertile patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) undergoing gonadotropins ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Infertile patients with PCOS undergoing gonadotropins ovarian stimulation with (metformin group, n=191) or without (control group, n=187) metformin and IVF were evaluated. Treatment characteristics, patients' data and reproductive outcomes were evaluated. In all cases, metformin with an immediate-release formulation was administered, and in most of cases it was given as pre- and co-treatment (74.9%) and at a dosage of 1700mg/day (59.7%). Stimulation length and gonadotropins doses were significantly (p<0.05) higher in metformin group than in control group. The number of dominant follicles on day of ovarian maturation triggering and peak oestradiol levels were significantly (p<0.05) lower in metformin group than in control group. Cycle cancellation rate under metformin resulted significantly influenced by interaction with body mass index (BMI), age and basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. Notwithstanding, metformin use in infertile PCOS patients who receive gonadotropins for IVF is not standardized, it seems to modulate the ovarian response to stimulation. This effect may benefit or harm on the basis of ovarian reserve and patients' characteristics. Â© 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Objective To compare the IVF/ICSI outcomes of the long GnRH agonist and the Wxed GnRH antagonist protocol in women with PCOS. Design Randomized controlled trial. Setting Baskent University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Patients Three hundred women with PCOS. Interventions IVF/ICSI following the long GnRH agonist down-regulation or the Wxed GnRH antagonist protocols. Main outcome measures Ongoing pregnancy rates. Results Ongoing pregnancy rates were 36.4 % in the OCP + GnRH agonist group and 35.9 % in the OCP + GnRH antagonist group (p > 0.05). Progesterone levels on the day of hCG (0.76 +/- 0.71 vs. 0.58 +/- 0.50), endometrial thickness on the day of hCG (11.57 +/- 2.50 vs. 10.50 +/- 2.01), total gonadotropin used (1388.71 +/- 482.39 vs. 1253.25 +/- 415.81), and duration of COH (9.07 +/- 1.96 vs. 8.39 +/- 1.75) were signiWcantly lower in the OCP + GnRH antagonist group. Conclusion The OCP + long GnRH agonist and the OCP + Wxed GnRH antagonist protocols yield similar ongoing pregnancy rates in women with PCOS. Although this study consisting three hundred patients, seems to be large enough in a single center, we were not able to reach to the actual size of power analysis which was approximately 3,000.

N2  - Background: The role of metformin in the treatment of infertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is still controversial. Objective and Outcomes: We investigated whether metformin decreases the early miscarriage rate and improves the pregnancy rates (PR) and live-birth rates (LBR) in PCOS. Method(s): This was a multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Three hundred twenty women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility were randomized to metformin (n = 160, Diformin; obese women, 1000 mg two times daily; nonobese subjects, 500 mg + 1000 mg daily) or identical doses of placebo (n = 160). After 3 months'treatment, another appropriate infertility treatment was combined if necessary. If pregnancy occurred, metformin/placebo was continued up to the 12th week. Result(s): Miscarriage rates were low and similar in the two groups (metformin 15.2% vs. placebo 17.9%,P= 0.8). Intent-to-treat analysis showed that metformin significantly improved PR and LBR (vs. placebo) in the whole study population (PR:53.6 vs. 40.4%, P = 0.006; LBR:41.9 vs. 28.8%, P = 0.014) and PR in obese women (49.0 vs. 31.4%,P= 0.04), and there was a similar trend in nonobese (PR:58.6 vs. 47.6%, P = 0.09; LBR:46.7 vs. 34.5%, P = 0.09) and in obese women with regard to LBR (35.7 vs. 21.9%, P = 0.07). Cox regression analysis showed that metformin plus standard infertility treatment increased the chance of pregnancy 1.6 times (hazard rate 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.13-2.27). Conclusion(s): Obese women especially seem to benefit from 3 months' pretreatment with metformin and its combination thereafter with routine ovulation induction in anovulatory infertility.

N2  - Background: To study the effect of metformin before and during assisted reproductive technology (ART) on the clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) in non-obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): A multi-centre, prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted in eight IVF clinics in four Nordic countries. We enrolled 150 PCOS women with a body mass index <28 kg/m2, and treated them with 2000 mg/day metformin or identical placebo tablets for <12 weeks prior to and during long protocol IVF or ICSI and until the day of pregnancy testing. The primary outcome measure was CPR. Secondary outcome measures included spontaneous pregnancy rates during the pretreatment period, and the live birth rate (LBR). Result(s): Among IVF treated women (n=112), biochemical pregnancy rates were identical in both groups (42.9), and there were no significant differences in the metformin versus the placebo group in CPR [39.3 versus 30.4; 95 confidence interval (CI): -8.6 to 26.5]. The LBR was 37.5 versus 28.6 (95 CI: -8.4 to 26.3). However, prior to IVF there were 15 (20.3) spontaneous pregnancies in the metformin group and eight (10.7) in the placebo group (95 CI: -1.9 to 21.1; P=0.1047). According to intention to treat analyses (n 149); significantly higher overall CPR were observed in the metformin versus placebo group (50.0 versus 33.3; 95 CI: -1.1 to 32.3; P=0.0391). LBR was also significantly higher with use of metformin versus placebo (48.6 versus 32.0; 95 CI: 1.1 to 32.2; P=0.0383). No major unexpected safety issues or multiple births were reported. More gastrointestinal side effects occurred in the metformin group (41 versus 12; 95 CI: 0.15 to 0.42; P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Metformin treatment for 12 weeks before and during IVF or ICSI in non-obese women with PCOS significantly increases pregnancy and LBRs compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on the outcome of ART per se.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00159575.

N2  - Background: Metformin has failed to gain wide acceptance as a first-line treatment option for women with anovulatory infertility related to polycystic ovary syndrome. This study aimed to ascertain factors that predict fertility success with treatment that included metformin compared to standard (nonmetformin) treatment. Method(s): Randomised trial data analysis by logistic regression of factors likely to have a differential influence on the likelihood of success of metformin versus nonmetformin treatment amongst women with ovulation dysfunction related to polycystic ovary syndrome. Result(s): For women within a BMI > 32 kg/m2 subpopulation, BMI had a significantly greater impact on the chance of pregnancy amongst women receiving metformin versus those receiving placebo and those with lower BMI who received metformin were more likely to become pregnant than their lower BMI counterparts who received placebo (P = 0.039). The subpopulation of women with BMI <= 32 kg/m;be had no factors showing a significantly different impact on the chance of pregnancy for women treated with metformin versus those receiving clomiphene treatment or combination metformin/clomiphene treatment versus clomiphene treatment. There were no significantly different effects of free testosterone, fasting insulin, duration of infertility or ultrasound appearance of polycystic ovaries in any treatment groups. Conclusion(s): This study provides preliminary evidence that BMI may be an important prognostic factor in response to metformin for women with ovulation dysfunction related to polycystic ovary syndrome, suggesting that women with a lower BMI may respond better to metformin treatment versus placebo amongst women with BMI > 32 kg/m;be. Individual patient data meta-analysis of existing randomised trials would clarify this further and would assess whether other factors might predict better response to metformin versus standard treatments.

N2  - This study aimed to assess the relationship between the serum levels of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and other hormonal markers and results of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. This cohort study was conducted on 60 PCOS patients who were candidates for assisted reproductive techniques. In all patients the serum levels of AMH, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), free testosterone (fT), testosterone (T) and inhibin B were measured in the 3rd day of menstrual cycle. The relationship between serum level of measured hormonal markers with retrieved oocytes, mature oocytes, the number of transferred fetus and pregnancy rate were assessed. The cut-off value for the serum level of AMH and retrieved oocytes were determined. There was a significant direct correlation between the serum mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) level with number of total picked up oocytes (r=0.412), mature oocytes (r=0.472) and embryo transfer (r=0.291). There was a linear and significant correlation between inhibin B and fertilization (r=0.283) Cut-off point for AMH level according to presence or absence of pregnancy was 4.8 ng/ml and it was not statistically significant (P=0.655). Area under curve (AUC) was 0.543. Cut-off point for MIS according to picked up oocytes was 2.7 ng/ml with area under the curve (ROC curve) of 0.724 (CI= 0.591-0.831) (P=0.002). Patients with PCOS who had AMH more than 2.7 ng/ml, the number of retrieved oocytes (6 or more) was higher than MIS/AMH <2.7 ng/ml (P=0.002). As a marker of ovarian responsiveness to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) and despite a small sample size of our study, it is revealed that pretreatment MIS/AMH is highly associated with the number of mature oocytes retrieved during COH in PCOS women.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of body mass index (BMI) on in vitro maturation (IVM) outcomes in women with polycystic ovaries. Design(s): Retrospective, cohort study. Setting(s): Tertiary IVF unit. Patient(s): One hundred thirteen women with polycystic ovaries. Intervention(s): One hundred sixteen cycles of IVM. Patients were divided into subgroups according to their BMI: underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese. We evaluated the effects of BMI on the number of oocytes matured in vivo, maturation rate in vitro, fertilization and cleavage rates, number of embryos transferred, implantation rates, pregnancy rates, and delivery rates. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pregnancy rate and delivery rate. Result(s): The number and quality of oocytes among women with different BMIs were similar. There was no significant difference in the endometrial thickness and rates of implantation, pregnancy, and delivery among women with different BMIs. The pregnancy rate in underweight women was 50%, normal weight 47.9%, overweight 29.1%, obese 27.2%, and in morbidly obese women was 30.7%. The miscarriage and delivery rates were also similar. Conclusion(s): The results of IVM are independent of BMI. Copyright Â© 2011 American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Ovulation induction treatment with metformin, either alone or in combination with clomiphene citrate (CC), remains controversial even though previous randomized trials have examined this. Method(s): A double blinded multi-centre randomized trial was undertaken including 171 women with anovulatory or oligo-ovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome. Women with high body mass index (BMI) > 32 kg/m2 received placebo ('standard care') or metformin; women with BMI <= 32 kg/m2 received CC ('standard care'), metformin or both. Treatment continued for 6 months or until pregnancy was confirmed. Primary outcomes were clinical pregnancy and live birth. Result(s): For women with BMI > 32 kg/m2, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates were 22 (7/32) and 16 (5/32) with metformin, 15 (5/33) and 6 (2/33) with placebo. For women with BMI <= 32 kg/m2, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates were 40 (14/35) and 29 (10/35) with metformin, 39 (14/36) and 36 (13/36) with CC, 54 (19/35) and 43 (15/35) with combination metformin plus CC. Conclusion(s): SThere is no evidence that adding metformin to 'standard care' is beneficial. Pregnancy and live birth rates are low in women with BMI > 32 kg/m2 whatever treatment is used, with no evidence of benefit of metformin over placebo. For women with BMI <= 32 kg/m2 there is no evidence of significant differences in outcomes whether treated with metformin, CC or both. Â© 2010 The Author.

N2  - Background: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are at risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) during ovarian stimulation. Use of GnRH antagonist in the general subfertile population is associated with lower incidence of OHSS than agonists and similar probability of live birth but it is unclear if this is true for patients with PCOS. Our aim was to compare the flexible GnRH antagonist and GnRH agonist long protocols in patients with PCOS undergoing IVF (primary end-point: ongoing pregnancy rate per patient randomized). Method(s): In this randomised controlled trial (RCT), 220 patients with PCOS were randomly allocated in two groups: long GnRH agonist down-regulation protocol (n = 110) and flexible GnRH antagonist protocol (n = 110). Result(s): No differences were observed in ongoing pregnancy rates [50.9 versus 47.3, difference 3.6, 95 confidence interval (CI):-9.6 to +16.8] in the agonist and antagonist protocols, respectively. Incidence of OHSS Grade II was lower in the antagonist compared with agonist group (40.0 versus 60.0, difference-20.0, 95 CI:-7.1 to-32.9, P < 0.01). Duration of stimulation (10 versus 12 days, difference 2 days, 95 CI: +1 to +2, P < 0.001) and total gonadotrophin required (1575 versus 1850 IU, difference-275 IU, 95 CI:-25 to-400, P < 0.05) were also lower in the antagonist compared with agonist protocol. Conclusion(s): SThe current RCT suggests that the flexible GnRH antagonist protocol is associated with a similar ongoing pregnancy rate, lower incidence of OHSS grade II, lower gonadotrophin requirement and shorter duration of stimulation, compared with GnRH agonist. The GnRH antagonist might be the treatment choice for patients with PCOS undergoing IVF.The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov. ID: NCT00417144.

T1  - Homocysteine concentrations in follicular fluid are associated with poor oocyte and embryo qualities in polycystic ovary syndrome patients undergoing assisted reproduction

N2  - BACKGROUND: A poor quality of oocytes and embryos and a low fertilization rate have been found in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. An inverse association between follicular fluid homocysteine (Hcy) levels and oocyte and embryo quality has also been demonstrated. We examined the relationship between follicular fluid Hcy concentrations and oocyte and embryo quality in PCOS patients undergoing assisted reproduction. METHOD(S): Fifty-two PCOS patients were included in the study, and underwent GnRH agonist/recombinant FSH treatment. The Hcy, folate, vitamin B12, malonyldialdehyde (MDA) and estradiol (E2) levels were measured in follicular fluid from single oocytes at time of retrieval. One follicle per ovary was sampled and 94 were analysed. Plasma hormones were also measured. Oocytes and embryos were graded (1-3) using standard approaches. RESULT(S): The concentrations of Hcy, E2, vitamin B12, folate and MDA in plasma were higher than in follicular fluid (all P < 0.001). Significant differences were observed in follicular Hcy levels between Grade 3 and Grade 2 oocytes (P < 0.001). Hcy levels were lower in Grade 1-2 embryos than that in Grade 3 embryos; follicular fluid vitamin B12 levels were lower in patients showing high concentrations of follicular fluid Hcy (P < 0.01). The follicular fluid Hcy levels were negatively correlated with follicular fluid vitamin B12 (r = -0.44), folate (r = -0.68) and fertilization rate (r = -0.85), and positively correlated with follicular fluid MDA (r = 0.51). CONCLUSION(S): Concentrations of Hcy in follicular fluid on the dOPU may be a useful marker for fertilization rate, and oocyte and embryo quality in PCOS patients undergoing assisted reproduction.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (LOD) is currently accepted as a successful second-line treatment for ovulation induction (OI) in clomiphene citrate (CC)-resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that LOD may be superior to CC as a first-line treatment. METHOD(S): The study included 72 anovulatory women with PCOS who were randomized to LOD (n = 36) or CC (n = 36). Women who remained anovulatory after LOD were offered CC. Similarly, women receiving CC who failed to ovulate or conceive were offered LOD. Pregnancy rates were compared between the two groups using chi2 and odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (OR, 95% CI). RESULT(S): After randomization, six women conceived before starting treatment and another patient postponed treatment. The remaining 65 women received the treatment (33 underwent LOD and 32 received CC). After the primary treatment, more pregnancies (44%) occurred in women receiving CC than in those undergoing LOD (27%), although the difference did not reach statistical significance [P = 0.13, OR 2.1 (0.7 - 5.8)]. After adding the second treatment, the pregnancy rate was still higher, but to a less extent, in the CC group [63% versus 52%, P = 0.2, OR 1.6 (0.6 - 4.2)]. CONCLUSION(S): LOD is not superior to CC as a first-line method of OI in women with PCOS. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov with an identifier number NCT00220545. Â© The Author 2008.

N2  - To determine if amenorrheic women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) demonstrate ultrasonographically detectable changes in follicle population. Sixteen women with PCOS reporting the absence of menses for more than 3 months were enrolled in the study. Subjects had a physical examination, fasting blood tests and two transvaginal ultrasound scans spaced 1 month apart. In cases where evidence of a morphologically dominant follicle (>= 10 mm in diameter) occurred, subsequent ultrasound scans were performed to determine the fate of the dominant follicle. Differences in total follicle population, maximum follicle diameter and clinical, hormonal and metabolic features were determined. Forty-four percent of subjects showed changes in follicle population of 6-10 follicles and 37% showed changes in follicle population of > 10. Maximum follicle diameters ranged between 5.4 and 33.0 mm. Four subjects demonstrated follicle diameters >= 10 mm. Of those who developed dominant follicles, two subjects ovulated, one subject developed a persistent anovulatory follicle and the dominant follicle regressed in the remaining subject. Diagnostic criteria for PCOS were similar among women that did or did not develop dominant follicles (menstrual cycle length, P = 0.880; hirsutism score, P = 0.809; free androgen index, P = 0.991; total follicle count, P = 0.199). However, lower glycosylated hemoglobin (P = 0.047) and insulin levels (P = 0.049) and better insulin sensitivity (P = 0.048) were noted in women who attained dominant follicles. Amenorrheic women with PCOS demonstrate changes in follicle population that are consistent with active follicle growth and regression despite prolonged periods of anovulation. Morphologic selection occurs in amenorrheic women and attainment of dominant follicles is associated with improved metabolic status. Copyright Â© 2010 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of letrozole with clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). STUDY DESIGN: In this clinical trial, 107 infertile patients with PCOS received either 100 mg clomiphene citrate (n = 57) or 5 mg letrozole (n = 50) daily since day 3-7 of their menstrual cycle. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was administered at a dose of 10,000 IU when at least 1 mature follicle was detected. A single intrauter ine insemination was performed 34 hours later. Then the size, number and growth rate of follicles, ovulation rate, endometrial thickness and pregnancy rate were measured in both groups. RESULT(S): The number and the size of mature follicles were similar between the 2 groups. The pregnancy rate in letrozole group was higher than that in the clomiphene group (20% vs. 14%), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.286). In letrozole group, 86% of patients developed mature follicles, all showing ovulation, whereas 72% of patients in clomiphene citrate group developed mature follicles (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION(S): Letrozole might be an acceptable alternative to clomiphene citrate to induce ovulation and pregnancy in PCOS patients. Â© Journal of Reproductive Medicine, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The prediction of in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes by anti-M?llerian hormone (AMH) measurement is getting increasing attention from clinicians. This study compares the relationship between serum or intrafollicular AMH levels and IVF outcomes in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHOD(S): This prospective study was carried out in two university-based fertility clinics. Serum samples were collected on cycle day 3 and follicular fluid (FF) was collected on the day of oocyte retrieval from 26 women with PCOS and 42 normo-ovulatory controls. AMH levels were measured in the samples using immunoenzymatic assay. The relationship between serum or FF AMH levels and IVF outcomes, including number of oocytes retrieved, oocyte maturation rate, fertilization rate, implantation rate, high quality grade embryo rate, and biochemical and clinical pregnancy rates were further assessed. RESULT(S): Median serum basal AMH and FF AMH levels were significantly higher in the PCOS group as compared to controls, the values being 14.2 ng/mL vs. 3.2 ng/mL (P<.001) and 8.2 ng/g protein vs. 4.7 ng/g protein (P<.01), respectively. In both groups, serum basal AMH levels showed a positive correlation with number of oocytes retrieved (r=0.323; P=.037 in control vs. r=0.529; P=.005 in PCOS). In the control group, there was a positive relationship between serum basal AMH levels and percentage of matured oocytes (r=0.331; P=.032) and implantation rate (r=0.305; P=.05). CONCLUSION(S): Serum basal, and not intrafollicular, AMH levels may be a good predictive factor for quantitative and qualitative IVF outcomes in normo-ovulatory, but not in PCOS patients.

N2  - Objective: To compare the effectiveness of letrozole and clomiphene citrate (CC) in induction of ovulation in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Prospective, randomized, not blinded, controlled trial. Setting(s): A tertiary level infertility care center. Patient(s): Sixty-four anovulatory patients with PCOS, who failed to ovulate when taking 100 mg/day CC in previous cycles. Intervention(s): Patients were randomly divided into two groups by lottery and treated with either 7.5 mg/day letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) or 150 mg/day CC for 5 days starting from day 3 of the menstrual cycle. Main Outcome Measure(s): Occurrence of ovulation, endometrial thickness, and pregnancy rate (PR). Result(s): Twenty (62.5%) patients from the letrozole group and 12 (37.50%) patients from the CC group ovulated during the observation period. Mean serum E2 level was 817.75 pg/mL and 448.03 pg/mL in the CC and letrozole groups, respectively, on the day of hCG administration. The mean endometrial thickness on the day of hCG administration was 9.03 mm and 10.37 mm in the CC and letrozole groups, respectively. The mean D21 serum P was 13.09 ng/mL and 19.09 ng/mL in the CC and letrozole groups, respectively. Thirteen patients from the letrozole group (40.63%) and six patients from the CC group (18.75%) became pregnant. Conclusion(s): Letrozole has better ovulation and PR in comparison to CC in patients with PCOS. Â© 2009 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Objectives: Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) has been put forward as the treatment of choice in women with clomiphene citrate (CC)-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), with tubo-ovarian adhesion formation as the major disadvantage. Our study proposed to compare the efficacy of laparoscopic unilateral ovarian drilling with bilateral ovarian drilling in terms of ovulation and pregnancy rate with the expected advantage of decreasing postoperative adhesion rate and change in fimbiro ovarian relationship with unilateral drilling. Method(s): This prospective randomized study included 44 patients with anovulatory infertility due to PCOS. Twenty-two patients underwent unilateral ovarian drilling in group-I and 22 patients underwent bilateral ovarian drilling in group-II between June 2005 and June 2007. The number of drilling site in each ovary was limited to five. The clinical and biochemical response, ovulation and pregnancy rates over a follow-up period of 1 year were compared. Tubo-ovarian adhesion rate was compared during cesarean section or during repeat laparoscopy. Result(s): There was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of clinical and biochemical response, ovulation rate and pregnancy rate. Postoperatively, tubo-ovarian adhesions could be assessed in 36.3% of the patients and no adhesions were found in a single case in either group. Conclusion(s): Unilateral drilling cauterization of ovary is equally efficacious as bilateral drilling in inducing ovulation and achieving pregnancy. Unilateral ovarian drilling may be a suitable option in clomiphene citrate resistant infertility patient of PCOS which can replace bilateral ovarian drilling with the potential advantage of decreasing the chances of adhesion formation.

N2  - Purpose: Letrozole, though reported to be an effective ovulation inducing agent, warrants larger randomized trials. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of letrozole with that of rFSH and clomiphene citrate(CC)/rFSH for ovarian stimulation in IUI cycles. Method(s): Randomized, prospective, single-blinded clinical trial. 1387 PCOS women after CC failure were randomized into three groups: Group A received letrozole, Group B received CC with two doses rFSH and Group C received continuous rFSH day 2 onwards until hCG injection. Result(s): Group A, B and C had an ovulation rate of 79.30%, 56.95% and 89.89% and cycle cancellation rate of 20.70%, 43.05% and 10.11%, respectively. Pregnancy rates in Group A, B and C were 23.39%, 14.35% and 17.92%, while the miscarriage rates were 13.80%, 16.67% and 14.52%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Letrozole appears to be a suitable ovulation inducing agent in PCOS women with CC failure and is found to be most effective when baseline estradiol level >60 pg/ml.

N2  - Summary This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of metformin vs placebo in women with polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS undergoing IVF treatment. A total of 66 CC-resistant patients were studied prospectively. The women were randomly assigned to receive 850 mg of metformin n 34 or placebo n 32 twice daily that started 1 month before commencing the IVF treatment and continued to the day of the pregnancy test. Compared with the metformin-treated group, women who received a placebo had a significant increase in terms of days of stimulation with HMG, number of HMG ampoules, number of follicles >14 mm, number of oocytes retrieved, number of mature eggs, fertilisation rate and oestradiol level on the day of hCG administration. Similarly, women in the placebo group showed a significant increase in poor quality embryos, cancellation rate and the rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, as compared with the metformin-treated group. On the other hand, women who received metformin showed a significantly higher number of good quality embryos and implantation rate when compared with the placebo controls. Despite the transfer of a similar number of embryos, an insignificant increased in the pregnancy rate along with significant reduction in the abortion rate was observed in the metformin-treated group as compared with the placebo controls. No fetal abnormalities were encountered in the babies born in the metformin-treated group. It is concluded that metformin affects positively the quality of both oocytes and embryos without a significant increase in the pregnancy rate. It decreases significantly the rates of abortion and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Â© 2009 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Objective: To evaluate the benefit of Metfomin added to Clomiphene Citrate in a primary ovulation induction protocol in PCOS patients Design: Prospective randomised controlled study Setting: Tygerberg Academic Hospital, Stellenbosch University and the Institute of Reproductive Medicine at Vincent Pallotti Hospital, Cape Town Patients: 107 patients presenting with PCOS Study: Group A was pre-treated with metformin 850 mg twice a day for at least 6 weeks before clomiphene was added and the metformin was used throughout the study period. Group B received clomiphene without pre-treatment with metformin. In both groups clomiphene was given at a starting dose of 50 mg day 4-8 and increase with increments of 50 mg to a maximum of 150 mg if no response was achieved. Result(s): The ovulation rate achieved in women in the M+C/C arm was 34/52 (65.4%) compared to 36/55 (65.5%) in the C/C arm. The treatment effect ((M+C/C) - C/C) is 0% with 95% confidence interval of -18.1% to 18%. The per protocol ovulation results were 34/42 (81%) in the M+C/C arm compared to 36/48 (75%) in the C/C arm. The ovulation rate difference was 6% with 95% confidence interval -11% to 22%. In a comparison of successful ovulating versus non-ovulating women from the trial the following were significant baseline determinants: lower median weight in the ovulating group (77 kg versus 86 kg, p=.021), lower median bmi (29.0 versus 32.9, p=.009), lower median DHEAS at baseline (4.6 compared to 7.0, p=.049), lower median 17OH-progesterone (2.2 versus 4.6, p=.027) and higher baseline median SHBG ( 37.8 compared to 28.5, p=.036). Conclusion(s): Although identical ovulation rates were observed in both arms equivalence could not be concluded with respect to the specified criteria. Â© 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Background: The optimal time for GnRH antagonist initiation is still debatable. The purpose of the current randomized controlled trial is to provide endocrine and follicular data during ovarian stimulation for IVF in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) treated either with a long GnRH agonist scheme or a fixed day-1 GnRH antagonist protocol. Method(s): Randomized patients in both groups (antagonist: n = 26; long agonist: n = 52) received oral contraceptive pill treatment for three weeks and a starting dose of 150 IU of follitropin beta. The primary outcome was E2 level on Day 5 of stimulation, while secondary outcomes were follicular development, LH during ovarian stimulation and progesterone levels. Result(s): Significantly more follicles on days 5, 7 and 8 of stimulation, significantly higher estradiol (E2) levels on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8 and significantly higher progesterone levels on days 1, 5 and 8 of stimulation were observed in the antagonist when compared with the agonist group. E2 was approximately twice as high in the antagonist when compared with the agonist group on day 5 of stimulation (432 versus 204 pg ml-1, P lt; 0.001). These differences were accompanied by significantly lower LH levels on days 3 and 5 and significantly higher LH levels on days 1, 7 and 8 of stimulation in the antagonist when compared with the agonist group. Conclusion(s): In PCOS patients undergoing IVF, initiation of GnRH antagonist concomitantly with recombinant FSH is associated with an earlier follicular growth and a different hormonal environment during the follicular phase when compared with the long agonist protocol.

N2  - Objective: To determine whether polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) adversely impacts IVF-embryo transfer outcomes in obese compared to lean patients. Design(s): Retrospective chart review. Setting(s): University-affiliated infertility program. Patient(s): Lean non-PCOS (n = 52), lean PCOS (n = 6), obese non-PCOS (n = 18), and obese PCOS (n = 10). Intervention(s): Ninety-four fresh nondonor IVF-embryo transfer cycles analyzed. Main Outcome Measure(s): Cycle characteristics, clinical pregnancy (PR) and live birth rates. Result(s): Lean PCOS had more dominant follicles (12.2 +/- 6.0 vs. 7.7 +/- 3.6), retrieved oocytes (22.2 +/- 9.2 vs. 12.6 +/- 5.8), and frozen embryos (5 +/- 4.6 vs. 1.4 +/- 2.6) than lean non-PCOS. Lean PCOS also used fewer gonadotropin ampules (18.8 +/- 6.0 vs. 29.2 +/- 14.2), but had more retrieved oocytes (22.2 +/- 9.2 vs.14.3 +/- 4.9) than obese PCOS. Obese non-PCOS had better-grade embryos (2.1 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.8) and fewer embryos transferred (2.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.6) than obese PCOS, but more embryos frozen than lean non-PCOS (3.2 +/- 3.2 vs. 1.4 +/- 2.6). Implantation rates trended downward in obese patients with PCOS, but no other differences were observed. Conclusion(s): Patients with PCOS with a body mass index (BMI) in the lean rather than the obese range have more favorable assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycle characteristics but show no clinical outcome differences.

N2  - Objective: To determine whether there are any differences in the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and implantation rates in high-risk patients undergoing IVF using a protocol consisting of GnRH agonist trigger after cotreatment with GnRH antagonist or hCG trigger after dual pituitary suppression protocol. Design(s): Prospective randomized controlled trial. Setting(s): University-based tertiary fertility center. Patient(s): Sixty-six patients under 40 years of age with polycystic ovarian syndrome, polycystic ovarian morphology, or previous high response undergoing IVF. Intervention(s): Patients were randomized to an ovarian stimulation protocol consisting of either GnRH agonist trigger after cotreatment with GnRH antagonist (study group) or hCG trigger after dual pituitary suppression with a GnRH agonist (control group). Both groups received luteal phase and early pregnancy supplementation with IM progesterone (P), and patients in the study group also received E2 patches and their doses were adjusted according to the serum levels. Main Outcome Measure(s): Incidence of OHSS and implantation rate. Result(s): None of the patients in the study group developed any form of OHSS compared with 31% (10/32) of the patients in the control group. There were no significant differences in the implantation (22/61 [36.0%] vs. 20/64 [31.0%]), clinical pregnancy (17/30 [56.7%] vs. 15/29 [51.7%]), and ongoing pregnancy rates (16/30 [53.3%] vs. 14/29 [48.3%]) between the study and control groups, respectively. Conclusion(s): The use of a protocol consisting of GnRH agonist trigger after GnRH antagonist cotreatment combined with adequate luteal phase and early pregnancy E2 and P supplementation reduces the risk of OHSS in high-risk patients undergoing IVF without affecting implantation rate.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The polycystic ovary syndrome is a common cause of infertility. Clomiphene and insulin sensitizers are used alone and in combination to induce ovulation, but it is unknown whether one approach is superior. METHOD(S): We randomly assigned 626 infertile women with the polycystic ovary syndrome to receive clomiphene citrate plus placebo, extended-release metformin plus placebo, or a combination of metformin and clomiphene for up to 6 months. Medication was discontinued when pregnancy was confirmed, and subjects were followed until delivery. RESULT(S): The live-birth rate was 22.5% (47 of 209 subjects) in the clomiphene group, 7.2% (15 of 208) in the metformin group, and 26.8% (56 of 209) in the combination-therapy group (P<0.001 for metformin vs. both clomiphene and combination therapy; P=0.31 for clomiphene vs. combination therapy). Among pregnancies, the rate of multiple pregnancy was 6.0% in the clomiphene group, 0% in the metformin group, and 3.1% in the combination-therapy group. The rates of first-trimester pregnancy loss did not differ significantly among the groups. However, the conception rate among subjects who ovulated was significantly lower in the metformin group (21.7%) than in either the clomiphene group (39.5%, P=0.002) or the combination-therapy group (46.0%, P<0.001). With the exception of pregnancy complications, adverse-event rates were similar in all groups, though gastrointestinal side effects were more frequent, and vasomotor and ovulatory symptoms less frequent, in the metformin group than in the clomiphene group. CONCLUSION(S): Clomiphene is superior to metformin in achieving live birth in infertile women with the polycystic ovary syndrome, although multiple birth is a complication.

N2  - Background: Adding metformin to clomiphene citrate in clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients increases ovulatory response. However, because of anti-estrogenic effects of clomiphene it may be associated with lower pregnancy rate, offsetting the ovulation rate benefit. Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor which induces ovulation without anti-estrogenic effects. Method(s): Infertile women with PCOS were randomly divided into metformin-letrozole (29 patients) and metformin-clomiphene groups (30 patients). After an initial 6-8 weeks of metformin, they received either letrozole (2.5 mg) or clomiphene (100 mg) from day 3-7 of their menstrual cycle. Estradiol (E2) levels, number of follicles, pregnancy rates and endometrial thickness were measured on the day of HCG administration. Result(s): Mean total E2 and E2 per mature follicle were significantly higher in clomiphene group without a difference in mean number of mature follicles >18 mm and ovulation rate. Endometrial thickness was significantly higher in letrozole group. The pregnancy rate in letrozole group (10 patients, 34.50%) as compared with clomiphene group (5 patients, 16.67%) did not show significant difference, whereas full-term pregnancies were higher in letrozole group (10 patients (34.50%) versus 3 patients (10%)]. Conclusion(s): In clomiphene-resistant PCOS patients, the combination of letrozole and metformin leads to higher full-term pregnancies. Â© 2006 Oxford University Press.

N2  - Background: Metformin appears to improve reproductive function in some women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We wished to explore the effect of metformin in women with PCOS undergoing IVF. Method(s): A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was carried out between 2001 and 2004. Patients with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment using a long GnRH agonist protocol were randomized to receive metformin (MET), 850 mg, or placebo (PLA) tablets twice daily from the start of the down-regulation process until the day of oocyte collection. The primary outcome was to be an improvement in the overall fertilization rate. Result(s): One-hundred and one IVF/ICSI cycles were randomized to receive metformin (52) or to receive placebo (49). There was no difference in the total dose of rFSH required per cycle (median dose: MET = 1200 U, PLA = 1300 U; P = 0.937). The median number of oocytes retrieved per cycle (MET = 17.2, PLA = 16.2; P = 0.459) and the overall fertilization rates (MET = 52.9%, PLA = 54.9%; P = 0.641) did not differ. However, both the clinical pregnancy rates beyond 12 weeks gestation per cycle (MET = 38.5%, PLA = 16.3%; P = 0.023) and per embryo transfer (MET = 44.4%, PLA = 19.1%; P = 0.022) were significantly higher in those treated with metformin. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the incidence of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) was observed (MET = 3.8%, PLA = 20.4%; P = 0.023), and this was still significant after adjustment for BMI, total rFSH dose and age (OR = 0.15; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.76; P = 0.022). Conclusion(s): Short-term co-treatment with metformin for patients with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI cycles does not improve the response to stimulation but significantly improves the pregnancy outcome and reduces the risk of OHSS.

N2  - Background: It has been reported that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) benefit from metformin therapy. Method(s): A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of obese (body mass index > 30 kg/m2), oligo-/amenorrhoeic women with PCOS. Metformin (850 mg) twice daily was compared with placebo over 6 months. All received the same advice from a dietitian. The primary outcome measures were: (i) change in menstrual cycle; (ii) change in arthropometric measurements; and (iii) changes in the endocrine parameters, insulin sensitivity and lipid profile. Result(s): A total of 143 subjects was randomized [metformin (MET) = 69; placebo (PL) = 74]. Both groups showed significant improvements in menstrual frequency [median increase (MET = 1, P < 0.001; PL = 1, P < 0.001)] and weight loss [mean (kg) (MET = 2.84; P < 0.001 and PL = 1.46; P = 0.011)]. However, there were no significant differences between the groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the independent variables (metformin, percentage of weight loss, initial BMI and age) in order to predict the improvement of menses. Only the percentage weight loss correlated with an improvement in menses (regression coefficient = 0.199, P = 0.047, odds ratio = 1.126, 95% CI 1.001, 1.266). There were no significant changes in insulin sensitivity or lipid profiles in either of the groups. Those who received metformin achieved a significant reduction in waist circumference and free androgen index. Conclusion(s): Metformin does not improve weight loss or menstrual frequency in obese patients with PCOS. Weight loss alone through lifestyle changes improves menstrual frequency. Â© The Author 2005.

N2  - Objective: To compare the use of an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole) with the use of clomiphene citrate (CC). Design(s): Prospective randomized study. Setting(s): An infertility clinic in a university hospital. Patient(s): Seventy-four consecutive infertile patients with polycystic ovary syndrome were recruited. Thirty-eight patients were randomized to the letrozole group (99 cycles), and the remaining patients were recruited to the CC group (95 cycles). Intervention(s): The aromatase inhibitor letrozole (2.5 mg/d) and CC (100 mg/d) were administered orally on days 3-7 of menses. Main Outcome Measure(s): Number of follicles, endometrial thickness, E2 levels on hCG day, and pregnancy rates among both groups. Result(s): Ovulation occurred in 65.7% (65/99) of letrozole cycles and in 74.7% (71/95) of CC cycles. The median (minimum-maximum) number of follicles sized >15 mm in diameter on the day of hCG administration were 1 (0-4) and 1 (0-5) in the letrozole and CC groups, respectively. On the day of hCG administration, median serum E2 concentrations in the letrozole and CC groups were statistically significantly different: 189 pg/mL (18-1,581 pg/mL) and 386 pg/mL (27-6,190 pg/mL), respectively. The median serum E2 concentrations per follicle sized >15 mm in diameter on the day of hCG also statistically significantly differed between the letrozole and CC groups: 160 pg/mL (18-808 pg/mL) and 281 pg/mL (27-2,615 pg/mL), respectively. The median endometrial thickness on the day of hCG did not significantly differ between the CC and letrozole groups; it was 8 mm. Pregnancy was achieved in nine cycles (9.1%) of the letrozole group and in seven cycles (7.4%) of the CC group, which also was not a statistically significant difference. Conclusion(s): The aromatase inhibitor letrozole may be an acceptable alternative to CC as an ovulation-induction drug in patients with PCOS. Â© 2006 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Objective: A randomized, prospective pilot study was conducted to evaluate the clinical and endocrine parameters following laparoscopic unipolar and bipolar ovarian drilling in infertile women with clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Study Design: This was a randomized, prospective pilot study of 20 patients with clomiphene-resistant PCOS attending the gynecology outpatient department and gynecology endocrinology clinic of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (New Delhi, India). The patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: unipolar (group I) and bipolar (group II), of 10 patients each. Outcome measures were ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, changes in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone levels, and alteration of glucose tolerance and insulin levels. Result(s): After ovarian drilling, 6 patients (60%) in group I and 8 (80%) in group II ovulated spontaneously (p = 0.63), and 3 (30%) more patients ovulated after clomiphene citrate in group I and 1 (10%) in group II, with a total ovulation rate of 90% in both groups (p = 0.46). Six (6; 60%) pregnancies resulted in group I and 8 (80%) pregnancies resulted in group II (p = 0.63). LH levels fell significantly only in group II after 3 months (11.11 +/- 1.25 to 4.88 +/- 1.34 mIu/mL; p = 0.036), and there was no significant change in FSH and testosterone levels in either group. The fasting serum insulin levels increased nonsignificantly from 17.70 +/- 5.27 muIU/mL to 21.90 +/- 7.43 muIU/mL (p = 0.71) in group I and from 7.73 +/- muIU/mL to 13.11 +/- 3.55 muIU/mL (p = 0.27) in group II 3 months after surgery. Area under curve (AUC) glucose and insulin values fell postoperatively in both the groups. Conclusion(s): Laparoscopic bipolar ovarian drilling is an effective alternative to unipolar drilling in resuming ovulatory cycles and conception. Bipolar electrocoagulation has merits of favorable success rates along with expected safety and chances of fewer post-operative adhesions. Â© Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Aim. The combination of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist and gonadotropin represents a valid alternative to the classical protocol with GnRH agonist for ovulation induction in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The use of metformin is of benefit to women with PCOS. The aim of the present study was to compare the stimulation characteristics and in vitro fertilization (IVF)-embryo transfer (ET) outcomes of the standard short GnRH antagonist protocol for ovarian stimulation with or without metformin. Materials and methods. We recruited 40 PCOS patients. The population studied was divided into two groups (A and B). Group A was pretreated for 2 months with metformin 1.5 g/day (Glucophage; Merck Pharm), and then stimulated with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) 150 UI/day (Gonal F 75 UI; Serono). GnRH antagonist, cetrorelix acetate 0.25 mg/day (Cetrotide; Serono), was started when the leading follicle reached 14 mm diameter on ultrasound scan. Group B was treated only with rFSH 150 UI/day and GnRH antagonist 0.25 mg/day when the leading follicle was >=14 mm in diameter. Results. In group A we found a statistically significant ( p < 0.05) decrease in the number of ampoules of rFSH (A vs. B: 18+/-6 vs. 24+/-8) and estradiol levels (A vs. B: 2400+/-600 vs. 3370+/-900 pg/ml) (all values mean+/-standard deviation). Group A had significantly fewer cancelled cycles (A vs. B: 1 vs. 3; p < 0.05). The incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was 5% in group A and 15% in group B ( p < 0.05). In patients treated with metformin, the total number of follicles on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin treatment (23+/-1.2 vs. 33+/-2.6) was decreased with no change in the number of follicles >=14 mm in diameter (A vs. B: 18+/-1.2 vs. 19+/-1.7). However, the mean number of mature oocytes (A vs. B: 8.4+/-1.5 vs. 5.0+/-1.5) was increased with metformin treatment (p < 0.05). No difference was found in the number of cleaved embryos (A vs. B: 2.5+/-0.5 vs. 2.2+/-0.3). Conclusions. The use of metformin with GnRH antagonist improves the outcome of ovarian stimulation in IVF-ET cycles in PCOS patients. Â© 2006 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Letrozole was compared with clomiphene citrate (CC) as a first-line treatment for ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovaries (PCOs). A total of 106 women with primary infertility and a diagnosis of PCOs were randomized to receive either 100 mg CC (n = 55) or 2.5 mg letrozole (n = 51) daily for 5 days. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) at a dose of 10000 IU was administered when at least one follicle with a mean diameter >= 18 mm was observed using transvaginal ultrasound. The number of mature follicles was significantly lower, but endometrial thickness and ovulation and pregnancy rates were significantly higher in the letrozole group than in the CC group. In conclusion, letrozole is associated with a higher pregnancy rate than CC in PCO patients and may have a role as a first-line treatment for anovulatory patients with PCOs.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcome of using gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists versus agonists in women with polycystic ovary disease (PCOD) who underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for assisted reproductive techniques (ART). STUDY DESIGN: A total of 129 patients with PCOD were randomly allocated to undergo COH with a GnRH antagonist (59 patients) and GnRH agonist (leuprolide acetate) (70 patients) to prevent a premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. Assisted fertilization following oocyte retrieval and embryo transfer was performed. RESULT(S): None of the cycles were cancelled due to a premature LH surge. There was no significant difference between the antagonist and agonist arms in the number of gonadotropin ampules consumed per cycle. However, in the antagonist arm a shorter duration of ovarian stimulation was recorded as compared to the agonist arm. Although similar numbers of oocytes was retrieved from both groups of patients, the quality of the oocytes, as measured by metaphase 2/total oocyte ratio, was lower in the antagonist arm as compared to the agonist arm. Pregnancy rates were 57.6% and 58.5% in the antagonist and agonist arms, respectively (p > 0.05). Implantation rates were not different (34.0% and 34.6%, respectively). The frequency of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome also did not differ between the treatment groups (5% and 7.1%, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): The size of our study, on a specific subgroup of patients, does not allow a reliable conclusion regarding ART outcome following the use of a GnRH antagonist versus agonist. Nevertheless, the protocol with the antagonist gave results that were as good as those of the protocol with the agonist in this PCOD patient population.

Basal steroid and gonadotropin levels were measured, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. The patients were divided randomly into group 1 (n=11) and group 2 (n=10). Group 1 patients were treated with 1700mg per day of metformin for 3 months. The basal tests and OGTT were repeated after metformin therapy. Group 2 patients did not receive metformin. The patients in both groups received 100mg of clomiphene citrate (CC) daily for 5 days until either a pregnancy occurred, or six CC cycles were reached. Metformin administration continued during CC therapy until the day of hCG in group 1. Serum progesterone (P) level >=5ng/ml was considered as confirmatory of ovulation. Ovulation and pregnancy rates after six cycles were determined. Result(s): Serum androgens and insulin response to OGTT decreased significantly after metformin therapy. Midluteal serum P level was significantly higher in cycles treated with metformin plus CC (P<0.05). The ovulation (38 of 51 cycles, 74.4% versus 34 of 55 cycles, 61.8%) and pregnancy rates (5 of 11 women, 45.5% versus 3 of 10 women, 30%) were higher, but not significantly, in the metformin plus CC group than in the CC alone group. All the patients who conceived had insulin resistance in group 1 whereas non-insulin resistance in group 2. Conclusion(s): Metformin improves insulin resistance and reduces androgen levels. Metformin did not increase significantly the ovulation and pregnancy rates. Â© 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Background: Our aim was to investigate the effect of pre-treatment with metformin in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) scheduled for IVF stimulation. Method(s): Seventy-three oligo/amenorrhoeic women with polycystic ovaries and at least one of the following criteria: hyperandrogenaemia, elevated LH/FSH ratio, hyperinsulinism, decreased SHBG levels or hirsutism, were studied. Normal weight and overweight patients were randomized separately in a prospective, randomized, double blind study. All patients were treated for at least 16 weeks with metformin (1000 mg bid) or placebo ending on the day of HCG injection. Result(s): No differences were found in the primary end-points: duration of FSH stimulation 14.4 (13.1-15.7) versus 14.2 (12.6-15.7) days or estradiol on the day of HCG injection 6.8 (5.3-8.2) versus 7.6 (5.6-9.6) nmol/l in the metformin and placebo groups, respectively. The secondary end-points number of oocytes, fertilization rates, embryo quality, pregnancy rates and clinical pregnancy rates were equal. However, in the normal weight subgroup (BMI <28 kg/m2, n = 27), pregnancy rates following IVF were 0.71 (0.63-0.79) versus 0.23 (0.15-0.31) in the metformin and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.04). Overall clinical pregnancy rates were equal: 0.51 (0.34-0.68) versus 0.44 (0.27-0.62) in the metformin and placebo groups, respectively. However, in the normal weight subgroup, clinical pregnancy rates were 0.67 (0.43-0.91) and 0.33 (0.06-0.60), respectively (P = 0.06). Conclusion(s): Pre-treatment with metformin prior to conventional IVF/ICSI in women with PCOS does not improve stimulation or clinical outcome. However, among normal weight PCOS women, pre-treatment with metformin tends to improve pregnancy rates. Further studies in subgroups of PCOS women are required.

N2  - Background: Recognition of the importance of insulin resistance in clomiphene-resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has led to the use of insulin sensitizers. Method(s): A randomized, controlled trial was conducted to compare efficacy of sequential treatment with metformin and clomiphene citrate with conventional gonadotrophins. Sixty clomiphene-resistant women with PCOS were randomized to two groups (n = 30 each), using computer-generated tables. Group I received metformin for 6 months, followed by ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate; group II received hMG for ovulation induction. Hormonal profiles were evaluated at the onset and after completion of treatment. Result(s): There was no significant difference in pregnancy rates between the two groups (16.7 versus 23.3%). In group I, there was a significant improvement in menstrual function and ovulation after treatment (40%, P < 0.001; and 46.7%, P < 0.001), with a significant decrease in fasting insulin levels (P < 0.05). There were no changes in other biochemical parameters. The ovulation rate in group II was 43.3%, with a high drop-out rate. The cost-effective analysis for medications per pregnancy in group I was US$ 71 +/- 3 versus US$ 277 +/- 171 in group II. Conclusion(s): Sequential treatment with metformin and clomiphene citrate is an effective and safe option for clomiphene-resistant women with PCOS.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic with ever increasing incidence and public health problems in both developing and developed countries. OBJECTIVE(S): The objective of the study is to investigate the incidence of obesity among patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome attending infertility clinic and the effect on treatment outcome. METHODOLOGY: Two hundred and seventy women with polycystic ovarian syndrome attending the infertility clinic were evaluated clinically, biochemically, and laparoscopically. They were stratified according to their body mass index (BMI) as follows: normal weight: 18-24; overweight: 25-29, obese:30-34, and grossly obese: > or = 35. Therapy included induction of ovulation with clomiphene citrate and gonadotrophins. The patients were followed up through during induction of ovulation and pregnancy. RESULT(S): There were ethnic differences in mean BMI. Significantly more obese women had oligomenorrhoea (p<0.01) and anovulation (p<0.01) than women with normal weight. Obesity adversely affected the outcome of ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate and gonadotrophins; 79% of women with BMI 18-24 ovulated at 6 months compared to 15.3% in those with BMI 30-34 (p<0.001) and 11.8% in women with BMI > or = 35 (p<0.001). The pregnancy rate and outcome were also adversely affected by obesity. CONCLUSION(S): Obesity has a negative impact on the outcome of treatment of infertility. Weight reduction programme should be an essential component of infertility management.

N2  - Group differences in symptomatology and symptom perception of young women ageing between 18 and 32 years suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) were tested according to cultural background and weight status. In detail 31 Austrian women, living in Carinthia, Austria, and 102 Brazilian women, living in Sao Paulo, Brazil, were enrolled in the present study. All participants suffered from diagnosed PCOS. The prevalence of hirsutism, infertility, menstrual disturbances and overweight/obesity and their individual impact on health related quality of life were analysed. Furthermore the impact of weight status (BMI) on symptom perception was tested. It turned out, that the Brazilian sample exhibited higher prevalence of PCOS symptoms and these symptoms had a more negative impact on quality of life. The only exception was body weight. Although significantly leaner, the Austrian women showed a higher Cronin score of body weight than their Brazilian counterparts. The results of the present study may indicate that in western industrialized societies the fear of overweight is much more prevalent than in a developing country such as Brazil and thus it has more influence on the quality of life than all the other symptoms.

N2  - Objective To obtain data from a pilot randomized trial on the effect of metformin therapy and lifestyle modification on ovulation and androgen concentrations in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Setting Academic medical center. Patient(s) Thirty-eight overweight or obese women with PCOS. Intervention(s) All subjects were randomized to one of four 48-week interventions: metformin 850 mg two times per day, lifestyle modification plus metformin 850 mg two times per day, lifestyle modification plus placebo, or placebo alone. Main outcome measure(s) Recruitment, dropout, and compliance with a long-term lifestyle intervention in PCOS; preliminary estimates of treatment effect on ovulation, as measured by weekly urinary pregnanediol glucuronide, and on total T and free androgen index. Result(s) It was necessary to screen seven women to have one subject randomized. The dropout rate was 39%, with the majority of dropouts occurring within the first 24 weeks. Mean body mass index was >39 mg/kg2. Modest weight reduction was found in all treatment groups, with the most significant reduction occurring with the combination of metformin and lifestyle intervention. Significant androgen reduction occurred in the combination group only. Ovulation rates did not differ significantly between groups. However, when data were analyzed by presence or absence of weight reduction in subjects, independent of treatment group, the estimated odds ratio for weight loss was 9.0 (95% confidence interval 1.2-64.7) with respect to regular ovulation. If weight loss occurred during metformin therapy, the odds ratio for regular ovulation was 16.2 (95% confidence interval 4.4-60.2). Conclusion(s) Key methodologic issues for a large-scale, randomized trial of lifestyle intervention in PCOS include minimizing early dropout from the lifestyle intervention and including a range of body mass index that is not skewed toward severe obesity. Weight reduction might play the most significant role in restoration of ovulation in obese women with PCOS. Â© 2004 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - This single centre randomized controlled trial was undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of clomiphene citrate and low-dose recombinant FSH as first line pharmacological therapy for anovulatory infertility associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Seventy-six infertile patients with PCOS were randomized to receive clomiphene citrate (50-150 mg/day for 5 days) (clomiphene citrate group, n = 38) or recombinant human FSH (FSH group, n = 38) in a chronic, low-dose, step-up protocol (daily starting dose 75 IU) for up to three consecutive cycles. Ovarian response was monitored by transvaginal ultrasonography and human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) was given-to trigger ovulation in all cycles with appropriate follicular development. The primary outcome measure was cumulative pregnancy after undergoing up to three treatment cycles. Secondary outcomes were cycle cancellation rate, ovulation rate per cycle, cumulative ovulation rate, pregnancy rate per cycle, incidence of OHSS, cumulative live birth rate, and multiple birth rate. One hundred and four clomiphene citrate cycles and 91 FSH cycles ware evaluable. The relative risk and its 95% confidence interval were 1.17 (0.97-1.46) for HCG cycles with ovulation, 1.78 (0.92-3.54) for the pregnancy rate per woman, and 1.83 (0.79-4.40) for live births per woman in favour of FSH. The cumulative pregnancy rate after three treatment cycles was 43% witdh FSH and 24% with clomiphene citrate (P = 0.06). By logistic regression analysis, the factors predicting ovulation included female age, serum androstenedione and use of FSH. Predictors of pregnancy were duration of infertility and use of FSH. This randomized controlled trial suggests that low-dose recombinant FSH may be an effective alternative to clomiphene citrate in first-line treatment for anovulatory PCOS patients. Thus, further studies, possibly multi-centre, in order to avoid problems with patient recruitment, are warranted to confirm these results.

N2  - Objective: To compare the effectiveness of an electrocautery strategy with ovulation induction using recombinant follicle stimulating hormone in patients with clomiphene resistant polycystic ovary syndrome. Design(s): Randomised controlled trial. Setting(s): Secondary and tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands. Participant(s): 168 patients with clomiphene citrate resistant polycystic ovary syndrome: 83 were allocated electrocautery and 85 were allocated recombinant follicle stimulating hormone. Intervention(s): Laparoscopic electrocautery of the ovaries followed by clomiphene citrate and recombinant follicle stimulating hormone if anovulation persisted, or induction of ovulation with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone. Main Outcome Measure(s): Ongoing pregnancy within 12 months. Result(s): The cumulative rate of ongoing pregnancy after recombinant follicle stimulating hormone was 67%. With only electrocautery it was 34%, which increased to 49% after clomiphene citrate was given. Subsequent recombinant follicle stimulating hormone increased the rate to 67% at 12 months (rate ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.24). No complications occurred from electrocautery with or without clomiphene citrate. Patients allocated to electrocautery had a significantly lower risk of multiple pregnancy (0.11, 0.01 to 0.86). Conclusion(s): The ongoing pregnancy rate from ovulation induction with laparoscopic electrocautery followed by clomiphene citrate and recombinant follicle stimulating hormone if anovulation persisted, or recombinant follicle stimulating hormone, seems equivalent to ovulation induction with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone, but the former procedure carries a lower risk of multiple pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: To examine the effect of metformin therapy on ovarian response in clomiphene-resistant PCOS patients. Design(s): Randomized prospective study. Setting(s): Zeynep Kamil Hospital IVF Center. Patient(s): Thirty-two female PCOS patients with clomiphene citrate resistance. Intervention(s): Test group A received 2x850 mg/day metformin therapy for 8 weeks, followed by gonadotropin induction. Only gonadotropin induction was applied to Control group B. Main Outcome Measure(s): Total gonadotropin dosage, duration of gonadotropin therapy, estradiol level on HCG-day, number of follicles with >=16 mm diameter, number of cases with hyperstimulation development, number of cancelled cycles, endometrial thickness on HCG-day, pregnancy outcome, multiple pregnancy rate. Result(s): The total gonadotropin doses given to metformin-study group was significantly lower than the control group. In addition, duration of therapy, HCG level, plasma estradiol level on HCG-day in the study group was significantly lower than in the control group. Conclusion(s): Metformin therapy has led to a higher pregnancy outcome, as well as to a decrease in hyperstimulation risk, cycle cancellations, and multiple pregnancy rates with a lower gonadotropin dosage.

N2  - The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the reproductive outcome of patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) treated by in-vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with recombinant FSH (rFSH) and gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists. One hundred and ten patients were evaluated. The starting dose of rFSH was 100 IU in 67 women with body mass index (BMI) <=29 kg/m2 and 200 IU in 43 women with BMI >29 kg/m2. GnRH antagonist was started by the detection of a follicle of >=5mm in ultrasound scan. A significantly lower ongoing pregnancy rate per oocyte retrieval (25.6% versus 46.7%, P = 0.04) and a higher occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (16.3% versus 3.0%, P = 0.03) was observed in the group of patients with BMI >29 kg/m2 as compared with the group of patients with BMI <=29 kg/m2, respectively. In conclusion, in GnRH antagonist cycles a worse reproductive outcome is expected in PCOS patients with BMI >29 kg/m2 in whom stimulation is initiated with 200 IU of rFSH as compared with PCOS patients with BMI <=29 kg/m2 in whom stimulation is initiated with 100 IU of rFSH.

N2  - Recent studies have proposed that, in women affected by the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), aging is able to regularize the menstrual cyclicity. To evaluate the ovarian response in PCOS patients according to their age, we studied 33 PCOS patients, 20 of whom with an age ranging from 28 to 34 years (younger PCOS) and 13 ranging from 35 to 45 years (older PCOS). All patients underwent an ovulation induction therapeutic protocol with low-dose recombinant follicle stimulating hormone, for a total of 80 cycles (44 cycles for the younger PCOS group and 36 cycles for the older PCOS group). No significant difference was found between the days of therapy (12.3 +/- 5.4 vs. 13.5 +/- 5.6 days), total amount of drugs (980.7 +/- 568.9 IU vs. 1063.9 +/- 469.5 IU) or ovulation rate (93% vs. 89%) in the two groups. The two groups showed a significant difference in the maximum estradiol level (2053.5 +/- 1497.2 vs. 1269.0 +/- 911.5pmol/l, p < 0.01), the number of the recruited and preovulatory follicles (1.7 +/- 2.5 vs. 0.64 +/- 0.9, p < 0.05 and 1.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.5, p < 0.01, respectively) and the pregnancy rate (36% vs. 14%, p < 0.05). In conclusion, our data clearly showed that, also in PCOS, advanced age is a negative prognostic factor in the ovarian response to ovulation induction therapies.

N2  - Metformin effectively restores insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), We examined whether metformin, given prior to and during ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF), altered follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) requirement and increased the number of collected oocytes in these women. Seventeen insulin-resistant women with PCOS were recruited to our IVF unit to receive two consecutive cycles of ovarian stimulation with or without metformin co-treatment, the order of treatments being randomized using a table of random numbers. Metformin treatment (1500 mg/day) started 3 weeks before downregulation with buserelin acetate and was continued throughout ovarian stimulation with human recombinant FSH. Nine women completed both cycles, the results of eight women being excluded because of pregnancy after the first cycle (n = 4) or because the protocol of the study was not followed (n = 4). Mean total FSH dose was 2301 IU (range 1500-6563 IU) in metformin cycles and 2174 IU (range 1200-3900 IU) in parallel control cycles, while the mean number of collected oocytes was 8.6 (range 2-28) and 4.6 (range 1-16), respectively. Bayesian analysis showed probabilities of 0.05 that metformin reduces FSH requirement by at least 10%, and of 0.61 that at least 10% more oocytes are collected after metformin co-treatment. Co-administration of metformin is therefore likely to increase the number of oocytes collected after ovarian stimulation in insulin-resistant women with PCOS but is unlikely to reduce the requirement for FSH.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: Metformin, an insulin-sensitizing agent, has been used successfully as the first-line drug to induce ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. There are, however, very few studies evaluating metformin treatment in women with clomiphene citrate (CC)-resistant polycystic ovaries (PCO). Method(s): Twenty infertile Chinese women aged <40 years, who had ultrasound features of PCO and remained anovulatory on CC, were randomized by computer using the sealed envelope method to receive placebo or metformin 500 mg three times a day for 3 months. Hormonal and metabolic profiles were determined before the therapy and were repeated after 3 months for women who failed to become pregnant within this period. Clomiphene was then added for one cycle to those women who did not ovulate after taking placebo or metformin alone. Result(s): The median ovulation rate in the placebo group was 0% (range: 0-50%) after placebo only and 6.9% (range: 0-50%) after placebo and CC, whereas the corresponding rates in the metformin group were 0% (range: 0-22%) and 0% (range: 0-22%) respectively. There was no improvement in the ovulation rate despite a significant reduction of body mass index, serum testosterone and fasting leptin concentrations in the metformin group. Conclusion(s): Metformin treatment may result in successful ovulation only in certain subgroups of these women.

N2  - The impact of insulin resistance on the outcome of IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) was examined. Insulin sensitivity was measured by the continuous infusion of glucose with model assessment (CIGMA) test. Insulin-resistant (n = 26) and non-insulin-resistant women (n = 30) with PCOS underwent a total of 100 cycles of long-term down-regulation with buserelin acetate, stimulation with human recombinant FSH, and IVF or ICSI. Blood samples were taken throughout ovarian stimulation for hormone assays. Insulin-resistant and non-insulin-resistant women had similar concentrations of FSH, LH, testosterone and androstenedione throughout stimulation, but insulin-resistant women had hyperinsulinaemia and lower sex hormone binding globulin concentrations. Insulin-resistant women also had lower oestradiol concentrations during stimulation and required higher FSH doses, but these differences disappeared after controlling for the higher body weight in the group of insulin-resistant women. Groups had similar number of oocytes collected, similar implantation and pregnancy rates, and the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was also similar. Obesity, independent of hyperinsulinaemia, was related to a lower oocyte count and increased FSH requirement. It is concluded that in PCOS women receiving long-term down-regulation and stimulation with recombinant FSH, insulin resistance is neither related to hormone levels nor to IVF outcome. Obesity, independent of insulin resistance, is associated with relative gonadotrophin resistance.

N2  - Background: This study aims to evaluate the impact of metformin on ovarian response when co-administered during recombinant (r)FSH using the low-dose step-up protocol in clomiphene citrate-resistant polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients with normal glucose tolerance. Methods and Results: Thirty-two patients were randomized to metformin (n = 16) and placebo (n = 16) groups. Hormonal assessment, a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a frequently sampled i.v. glucose tolerance test (FSIGTT) were performed before and after oral administration of metformin (850 mg twice daily) or placebo for 6 weeks. Recombinant FSH treatment was undertaken, thereafter, in women who did not ovulate on metformin (n = 10) or placebo (n = 15). There was no significant change in all insulin sensitivity indices in both groups. The only change noted was a decline in mean serum free testosterone concentration in the metformin group (P = 0.049). One patient on placebo and six patients on metformin ovulated spontaneously (P < 0.05). All parameters of ovarian response were comparable between the two groups during rFSH treatment. Combining the 6 week placebo or metformin-only period with a single rFSH treatment cycle, the overall ovulation rates were 75 and 94% in the placebo and metformin groups respectively (P > 0.05). The respective figures for pregnancy were 6.3 and 31.3% (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Metformin may restore ovulation with no improvement on insulin resistance in clomiphene citrate-resistant PCOS patients with normal glucose tolerance, but has no significant effect on ovarian response during rFSH treatment.

T1  - Polycystic ovarian syndrome and the risk of spontaneous abortion following assisted reproductive technology treatment

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: A high proportion of infertile patients have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) with a reportedly greater risk of spontaneous abortion. Because of the close link between PCOS and obesity and the independent association of obesity with poor pregnancy outcomes, it is important to distinguish the possible confounding effect of body mass index (BMI) or other variables from that of PCOS. This study aims to determine the effect of PCOS status on the risk of spontaneous abortion with adjustment for body mass and several other confounding factors in a large cohort of pregnant infertile women. Method(s): The patients (n = 1018) were treated in a tertiary infertility centre. Their PCOS status was determined by standard criteria and their BMI had been taken less than 1 year before the pregnancy. Patients whose PCOS status or BMI measurements were not assessed were excluded. Student's t-test or XX2 test were used to test the difference between the PCOS and non-PCOS groups while a multivariate logistical regression model was used to assess the effect of PCOS, BMI and other confounding factors. Result(s): Overall, the incidence of PCOS was 37% in this cohort. The overall incidence of spontaneous abortion in the study population was 21%. Univariate analysis showed that women with PCOS had a significantly greater risk of spontaneous abortion compared with non-PCOS women (25 versus 18%, P < 0.01). However, using multivariate logistic regression analysis this effect was reduced to a non-significant level [odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85-1.36] after adjusting for obesity and patients/treatment combination factor, and to nil after adjusting for all confounding factors considered in this study (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.75-1.28). Conclusion(s): The results of this study suggest that the higher risk of spontaneous abortion observed in women with PCOS is likely to be due to their high prevalence of obesity and the type of treatment they receive.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of metformin therapy on hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, cervical scores, ovulation, and pregnancy rates in clomiphene citrate-resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Setting(s): Infertility clinic of a tertiary referral center. Patient(s): Fifty-six women with clomiphene citrate-resistant PCOS. Intervention(s): Two cycles of oral metformin therapy (850 mg, twice daily) in group I and placebo therapy (twice daily) in group II. Clomiphene citrate (100 mg/day) on cycle days 3-7 of the second cycle in both groups. Main Outcome Measure(s): Insulin, T, DHEAS, FSH, LH, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, endometrial thickness, cervical score, ovulation, and pregnancy rates in clomiphene-induced cycles after metformin therapy. Result(s): Metformin therapy resulted in a significant decrease in total T, LH level, LH/FSH ratio, insulin resistance, and mean BMI. No difference in waist-to-hip ratio, DHEAS level, and fasting insulin level was observed. Clomiphene citrate induction resulted in higher ovulation rates and thicker endometrium in the metformin group than in the placebo group. There was higher cumulative pregnancy rate in the metformin group; however, there was no significant difference in the pregnancy rate between the two groups. Conclusion(s): Metformin therapy not only decreases hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance but also improves ovulation rates, cervical scores, and pregnancy rates in clomiphene citrate-resistant women with PCOS.

N2  - Objective: To compare the effectiveness of laparoscopic ovarian diathermy with gonadotropin ovulation induction for women with clomiphene citrate-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome. Design(s): Randomized controlled trial. Setting(s): A tertiary referral fertility clinic. Patient(s): Women with anovulatory infertility secondary to clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome. Inclusion criteria were age of <39 years, body mass index of <35 kg/m2, failure to ovulate with 150 mg of clomiphene citrate for 5 days in the early follicular phase, >12 months of infertility, and no other causes of infertility. Intervention(s): Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy versus three cycles of urinary or recombinant gonadotropins. Main Outcome Measure(s): Cumulative pregnancy and miscarriage rates. Result(s): Cumulative pregnancy rates were 28% at 6 months for laparoscopic ovarian diathermy and 33% for three cycles of ovulation induction with gonadotropins. There were three miscarriages in each group. Women in the laparoscopic ovarian diathermy arm of the study had four additional spontaneous pregnancies 6 to 12 months after surgery. Conclusion(s): There was no statistically significant difference in pregnancy or miscarriage rates during the 6-month follow-up period or the three cycles. Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy is a safe and effective alternative to ovulation induction with gonadotropins. Â© 2002 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

T1  - Ovarian function and metabolic factors in women with oligomenorrhea treated with metformin in a randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial

N2  - Women with oligomenorrhea and polycystic ovaries show a high incidence of ovulation failure perhaps linked to insulin resistance and related metabolic features. A number of reports show that the biguanide metformin improves ovarian function. However, in these trials the quality of evidence supporting ovulation is suboptimal, and few studies have been placebo-controlled. The aim of our study was to use a double-blind, placebo-controlled approach with detailed assessment of ovarian activity (two blood samples per week) to assess the validity of this therapeutic approach in this group of women. Of the 94 patients randomized, 2 withdrew before treatment commenced, 47 received placebo, and 45 received metformin (850 mg, twice a day). The numbers discontinuing the study prematurely were higher in the treatment group (n = 15) than the placebo group (n = 5; P < 0.05). The ovulation frequency assessed by the ratio of luteal phase weeks to observation weeks was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the treated group (23%) compared with the placebo (13%), and the time to first ovulation was significantly (P < 0.05) shorter [23.6 d; 95% confidence interval (CI), 17, 30; compared with 41.8 d; 95% CI, 28, 56]. The proportion of patients failing to ovulate during the placebo-treatment period was higher (P < 0.05) in the placebo group, and the majority of ovulations were characterized by normal progesterone concentrations in both groups. The effect of metformin on follicular maturation was rapid, because the E2 circulating concentration increased over the first week of treatment only in the metformin group. Significant (P < 0.01) weight loss (and leptin reduction) was recorded in the metformin group, whereas the placebo group actually increased weight (P < 0.05). A significant increase in circulating high-density lipoprotein was observed only in the metformin-treated group. Metabolic risk factor benefits of metformin treatment were not observed in the morbidly obese subgroup of patients (body mass index > 37). No change in fasting glucose concentrations, fasting insulin, or insulin responses to glucose challenge was recorded after 14-wk metformin or placebo therapy. There was an inverse relationship between body mass and treatment efficacy. We show in a large randomized placebo-controlled trial that metformin treatment improves ovulation frequency in women with abnormal ovarian function and polycystic ovaries significantly but to a modest degree, and protracted treatment improves cardiovascular risk factors. These data support a beneficial effect of metformin in improving ovarian function in women with oligomenorrhea and polycystic ovaries.

N2  - Objective: To determine whether metformin treatment increases the ovulation and pregnancy rates in response to clomiphene citrate (CC) in women who are resistant to CC alone. Design(s): Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting(s): Multicenter environment. Patient(s): Anovulatory women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who were resistant to CC. Intervention(s): Participants received placebo or metformin, 500 mg three times daily, for 7 weeks. Information on reproductive steroids, gonadotropins, and oral glucose tolerance testing was obtained at baseline and after treatment. Metformin or placebo was continued and CC treatment was begun at 50 mg daily for 5 days. Serum P level >= 4 ng/mL was considered to indicate ovulation. With ovulation, the daily CC dose was not changed, but with anovulation it was increased by 50 mg for the next cycle. Patients completed the study when they had had six ovulatory cycles, became pregnant, or experienced anovulation while receiving 150 mg of CC. Main Outcome Measure(s): Ovulation and pregnancy rates. Result(s): In the metformin and placebo groups, 9 of 12 participants (75%) and 4 of 15 participants (27%) ovulated, and 6 of 11 participants (55%) and 1 of 14 participants (7%) conceived, respectively. Comparisons between the groups were significant.Conclusion(s): In anovulatory women with PCOS who are resistant to CC, metformin use significantly increased the ovulation rate and pregnancy rate from CC treatment.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate whether pretreatment with metformin improves FSH- induced ovulation in women with clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Randomized prospective trial. Setting(s): Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Siena. Patient(s): Twenty women with clomiphene citrate-resistant PCOS. Intervention(s): The women were divided randomly into groups A and B (10 subjects each). Group B received 1,500 mg of metformin for at least a month before a single cycle of FSH stimulation. Group A underwent two cycles of FSH stimulation and then received metformin for a month before undergoing a third cycle. Main Outcome Measure(s): The number of FSH ampules, days of treatment, E2 level on the day of hCG, number of follicles >15 mm, number of hyperstimulation, and the number of cycles with hCG withheld. Result(s): The number of follicles >15 mm in diameter on the day of hCG administration was significantly lower in cycles performed after metformin treatment. The percentage of cycles with hCG withheld because of excessive follicular development was significantly lower in cycles treated with metformin. Plasma levels of E2 were significantly higher in cycles treated with FSH alone than in those treated with FSH and metformin. Conclusion(s): By reducing hyperinsulinism, metformin determines a reduction in intraovarian androgens. This leads to a reduction in E2 levels and favors orderly follicular growth in response to exogenous gonadotropins.
