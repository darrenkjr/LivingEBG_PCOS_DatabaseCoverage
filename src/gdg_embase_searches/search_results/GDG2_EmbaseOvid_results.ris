N2  - OBJECTIVES: Objective of the study was to evaluate the depression, anxiety and perceived stress level in adolescent girls with diagnosed polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as well as to assess their body and self-esteem and its impact on emotional status. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 27 adolescent girls with confirmed diagnosis of PCOS (study group) as well as 27 healthy, regularly menstruating, age and BMI matched girls (control group) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and Body-Esteem Scale (BES) containing three subscales (sexual attractiveness, weight concern, physical condition) were performed. RESULT(S): There were no significant differences between PCOS group and control group in depression and PSS-10 scores, but the anxiety score was significantly higher in control than in PCOS group (9.6 +/- 3.0 vs 7.3 +/- 3.9, p = 0.02). Moreover, in BES subscales' scores there were no significant differences between the groups, whereas RSES score was significantly higher in PCOS group (25.0 +/- 7.1 vs 28.3 +/- 4.6, p = 0.04). In PCOS group anxiety score was related to PSS-10 score (r = 0.56, p = 0.005). Moreover, we found that obesity was negatively related to anxiety (ry = -0.4, p = 0.04), depression (ry = -0.48, p = 0.02), PSS-10 (ry = -0.59, p = 0.004) and physical condition scores (ry = -0.44, p = 0.04). In girls with PCOS the more severe depression the worse weight control (ry = -0.56, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION(S): We conclude that in adolescent girls PCOS is not related to anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as poor self-esteem.

N2  - Objective: To investigate psychological distress, serum levels of monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolites, as well as their correlation with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): Thirty infertility patients with PCOS were assigned as the experimental group and 30 infertility patients without PCOS were assigned as the control group. Psychological distress was self-evaluated in all patients with Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90). Serum concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), dopamine (DA) and its metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and dihydroxy-phenyl acetic acid (DOPAC) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Result(s): The anxious and depressive subscales of SCL-90 were significantly higher in infertility patients with PCOS than those without PCOS (p < 0.05). The serum concentrations of 5-HT, 5-HIAA and HVA were significantly lower in infertility patients with PCOS than those without PCOS (p < 0.05). Importantly, the phobia subscale scores of SCL-90 positively correlated with serum MHPG level (p < 0.05), while the hostility subscale's scores negatively correlated with serum DOPAC level (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Psychological and neurological factors play a crucial role in PCOS. Â© 2011 Springer-Verlag.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Objective: The relationship between sexual functions and infertility remains controversial and there is a limited number of studies reporting the effects of infertility on sexual functions in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Aim(s): The present study aims to investigate the effects of infertility on sexual functions and depression levels in women with PCOS. Method(s): A total of 150 participants who were either fertile patients with PCOS, infertile patients with PCOS, or fertile women without PCOS (control) (n = 50) were included for the study. Sociodemographic data were recorded and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used for evaluation of subjects. Result(s): Body mass index (BMI) was found to be significantly higher in the PCOS plus infertility group (27.9 +/- 2.9, P = 0.01) than the other groups. Total BDI score was higher and total FSFI score was significantly lower in the PCOS plus infertility group than in the other groups. The PCOS plus infertility group showed significantly lower FSFI scores than the PCOS group in terms of desire, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. A significant negative correlation was observed between BMI and BDI scores in the PCOS plus infertility group (r:-0.384, P = 0.04). Conclusion(s): Our study results show lower sexual functions in PCOS women with infertility and that infertility negatively affects sexual functions with obesity associated depression.

T1  - 'I'm usually being my own doctor': women's experiences of managing polycystic ovary syndrome in Canada
A1  - Ismayilova M.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex, chronic condition characterized by anovulation, polycystic ovarian morphology and hyperandrogenism that requires lifelong management. To reduce the risk of comorbidity and to manage symptoms, lifestyle management and pharmaceuticals such as oral contraceptives are the most common forms of treatment and should be tailored to the individual patient. The literature to date has shown PCOS patients to experience widespread dissatisfaction with the amount and quality of information they receive from providers, along with lower levels of trust in physicians. Little is known about the lived experiences of women managing PCOS in Canada, across age groups. METHOD(S): In-depth remote interviews explored women's lived experiences managing PCOS and the barriers and facilitators they encountered in their management journeys. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis and interpretive description methodology. RESULT(S): Twenty-five in-depth, telephone interviews conducted with participants (aged 18-63 y) across Canada revealed participants lacking sufficient information and guidance from physicians, especially in primary care. Areas in need of more guidance included lifestyle management and mental health. Lack of empathy and weight bias among physicians were also perceived by participants. Older participants received little guidance on treatment options postmenopause. Loss of trust and withdrawal from seeking medical care were prominent themes, along with greater self-reliance on self-management, including self-educating and self-experimenting with treatments. CONCLUSION(S): Most women in this study were frustrated with the level of involvement and information provision from their doctors. Key recommendations are identified for the provision of care to younger and older patients with PCOS. Improved education for physicians may be needed to improve the quality of healthcare provision for PCOS.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2022.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 3-8% of adolescents. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism and oligoovulation/anovulation. PCOS has a negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, the extents to which factors influence total HRQoL of adolescents are not known. Adult PCOS patients have a higher incidence of binge eating than the general reproductive-age female population. Limited data on binge eating in adolescents with PCOS are available. Aim of this study was to investigate how PCOS and its associated factors, including binge eating, affect the HRQoL of adolescent girls. Method(s): This case-control study recruited 63 adolescent girls 13-18 years of age with PCOS and 66 age-matched healthy controls. The PCOS health-related quality of life questionnaire (PCOSQ) and Binge Eating Scale (BES) were used. Multiple linear regression was executed to establish exact predictors and their effect on total HRQoL. Result(s): HRQoL was significantly lower in adolescents with PCOS than controls (4.9 (interquartile range (IQR) 1.5) vs. 5.8 (IQR 0.9) points). The lowest scores were found in the body hair and weight domains. BES results were not significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the control group (p = 0.727). The main predictors for total HRQoL were PCOS diagnosis per se (beta = -1.002; p < 0.001), BES score (beta = -0.27; p = 0.004) and body mass index (BMI) percentile (beta = -0.007; p = 0.013). Conclusion(s): The lower HRQoL in adolescents with PCOS is attributable to the diagnosis of PCOS, BES score and BMI percentile, confirming the importance of tailoring clinical interventions and counselling to address the domains (i.e., symptoms of hirsutism and weight concerns) causing distress and lowering HRQoL. Further implementation research is required to evaluate the impact of targeted interventions on the HRQoL of adolescent girls with PCOS.Copyright: Â© 2022 The Author(s).

N2  - Study Question: Do mental health and sexual function differ between women with or without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with comparable BMI and fertility characteristics? Summary Answer: Women with PCOS have a poorer mental quality of life than women without PCOS, but there were no differences in symptoms of depression, anxiety, physical quality of life or sexual function. What is Known Already: Various studies suggest that women with PCOS have poorer mental health, such as higher symptoms of anxiety and depression with a lower quality of life, and have an impaired sexual function compared to women without PCOS. However, in most studies, BMI and infertility status differ between women with and without PCOS, which may hamper comparability. Study Design, Size, Duration: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of a 5-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among women with obesity and a history of infertility. Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods: Participants in this follow-up study of an RCT were women with obesity and infertility randomized to a lifestyle intervention followed by infertility treatment or prompt infertility treatment (control), stratified by ovulatory status and trial centre. In total, 173 (30.0%) women of the 577 women randomized in the initial trial participated in this follow-up study, with a mean follow-up of 5.5 years (range 3.7-7.0 years); of these women 73 had been diagnosed with PCOS and 100 did not have PCOS. Participants completed questionnaires on symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS)), quality of life (36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)) and sexual function (McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire (MFSQ)). We also compared quality of life subscale scores in women with and without PCOS and compared them to an age-matched Dutch reference population with average BMI. Effect sizes were calculated to assess the differences. Main Results and the Role of Chance: Symptoms of anxiety and depression, physical quality of life and sexual function did not differ significantly between obese women with and without PCOS. However, women with PCOS had a worse mental quality of life summary component score (-3.60 [95% CI -6.72 to -0.56]), mainly due to a lower score on the subscale 'role limitations due to emotional problems' (-12.41 [95% CI -22.78 to -2.28]), compared to women without PCOS. However, compared to an age-matched Dutch reference population, the obese infertile women with and without PCOS both scored lower on almost all physical and mental quality of life subscales. Limitations, Reasons for Caution: These are secondary analyses of the follow-up study of the RCT. No power analysis was performed for the outcomes included in this analysis and, as our study had a relatively small sample size, the null findings could be based on insufficient power to detect small differences between the groups. Our study population had a high mean BMI (average total group 34.5 [SD +/- 5.1]); therefore, our results may only be generalizable to women with obesity. Wider Implications of the Findings: Our results indicate that PCOS status is associated with impaired mental quality of life. Anxiety and depression, physical quality of life and sexual function in obese infertile women with PCOS seem more related to the obesity than the PCOS status. Study Funding/Competing Interest(s): The initial study and follow-up were supported by grants from: ZonMw (50-50110-96-518), the Dutch Heart Foundation (2013T085) and the European Commission (633595).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders found in women of reproductive age. Differences in hormonal and metabolic profiles are observed in groups of patients with normal and elevated BMI. Cause of disturbances observed in the two groups of patients with PCOS is analyzed. The aim of the study is to assess whether psychological parameters of lean and obese patients with PCOS are comparably significantly different and whether there is a correlation between these characteristics and the concentration of various hormones. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURES: The study consisted of 20 patients with diagnosed polycystic ovary syndrome and 20 healthy women of similar age. Both groups were stratified according to BMI. Specific psychological parameters and hormones were estimated in all patients. RESULT(S): In our study, we found that patients with BMI <25 represented personality traits associated with lower resistance to stress. We also observed significantly higher ACTH levels in the same group as compared to patients with BMI >25. A correlation between plasma ghrelin and the severity of anxiety experienced by test subjects was also observed. CONCLUSION(S): The type of personality and emotional disorders in lean PCOS patients may lead to the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and disturbences in hypothalamic-pituitary-ovary (HPO) axis. The results suggest participation of primary hypothalamic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of PCOS in patients with specific fenotype. Ghrelin is a hormone that may affect the symptoms of PCOS in lean patients. Psychological therapy should be considered as a permanent element in the therapeutic plan provided to PCOS patients.

N2  - Background and Objectives: Mental health disorders are often the consequence of hormonal disorders such as those accompanying polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), where changes in appearance and having to deal with a number of other problems occur due to this illness. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression symptoms, the level of ego-resiliency, and the ways that women with PCOS cope with stress compared to healthy women in order to determine the influence of socio-demographic characteristics in relation to levels of anxiety and depression with ego-resiliency and stress-coping methods. Material(s) and Method(s): The study was conducted in Poland in 2021 and included 230 women with PCOS and 199 healthy controls aged 20-40 years old. The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADs), ego-resiliency scale, as well as the MINI-COPE inventory were used. Result(s): The women with PCOS had higher levels of anxiety and depression and poorer ego-resiliency in comparison to the healthy women. The women with PCOS used passive stress-coping strategies significantly more commonly than the healthy women. Living in rural areas, having a lower level of education and being childless increased anxiety levels. Similarly, being over 30, living in a rural area, having a lower level of education, being childless, and being obese increased depression levels in the women with PCOS. A low level of ego-resiliency and passive stress-coping strategies are predictors of high levels of anxiety and depression in women with PCOS. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS should be checked for anxiety and depression. They should also be checked to see whether they have the resources to cope with chronic stress in order to optimize therapeutic interventions.

T1  - What can be done to improve polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) healthcare? Insights from semi-structured interviews with women in Canada
A1  - Ismayilova M.
A1  - Yaya S. 
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common and perplexing condition affecting metabolic, reproductive, cardiovascular, and psychological health in women. Previous studies point to widespread dissatisfaction and frustration in women with the information and care they receive. Studies have found delays with the diagnosis of PCOS and gaps in knowledge in physicians regarding the diagnosis and management of PCOS. Little has been heard from women on what they think can be improved with PCOS care, especially in Canada. This qualitative study explores women's experiences navigating the healthcare system and their insights on what could be improved based on their lived experiences. Method(s): Twenty-five participants were interviewed remotely over the phone by the first author between October and December 2018.Interviews were semi-structured and in-depth. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis and interpretive description methodology. Result(s): Twenty-five in-depth interviews conducted with participants across Canada (ages 18-63) revealed three overall areas in need of improvement. First, women emphasized a need for greater knowledge and awareness of PCOS in primary care physicians (PCPs) as well as the need for the medical community to prioritize women's health. Second, participants advocated for greater PCOS awareness and de-stigmatization in the general community and in women and girls, and any individuals with female reproductive systems. Third, participants brought up several needed resources, such as the need for more PCOS research to be funded and undertaken, more PCOS specialists and experts to be available, credible doctor-provided information (e.g., pamphlets, websites), and age-specific support groups and mental health supports to be available. Participants were generally unaware of existing PCOS organizations and brought up the need for established PCOS organizations to aid in the training and retraining of doctors and local awareness-building in communities. Conclusion(s): Participants believed that PCPs in Canada needed to be well-versed on how to diagnose and manage PCOS to prevent delays in diagnosis and provide easier access to care. Further, greater awareness and de-stigmatization in the general community are needed so women can identify symptoms early and have access to support from those around them. Overall, PCOS may be an overlooked and under-prioritized condition, both in the Canadian healthcare system and general community.Copyright Â© 2022, The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose To investigate the difference in character strengths (CSs) between patients with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the association between biological (i.e., testosterone levels) and psychological factors (i.e., character strengths). Patients and methods A total of 99 women divided into PCOS (49) and non-PCOS (50) groups who presented to the gynecological clinics at the women's center in the American University of Beirut Medical Center in 2017 were included. Women were assessed for testosterone bioavailable levels and completed a questionnaire that included Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Values in Action Survey-72. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to examine the association of CSs between the two groups and its predictors. Results The scores of hope, judgement, perspective, and transcendence of the PCOS group were significantly higher in comparison with healthy participants. An increase in free androgen index was negatively correlated to the score of judgement only. Conclusion Women with PCOS have their own profile of character strengths and virtues that constitute judgement, hope, perspective, and transcendence. This in turn can be utilized to reinforce those personality strengths and thus decrease the psychological distress and mood disorders accompanied with this disease.Copyright: Â© 2022 Ghazeeri et al.

N2  - Background: Sexuality as a fundamental component of women's health, can be affected by infertility. The current study aimed at comparing the prevalence of sexual dysfunction among women with the most common causes of infertility. Method(s): The current cross-sectional study was conducted on 240 infertile females with infertility due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS, n = 80), endometriosis (n = 80) and male factor (n = 80) at Royan Institute for Reproductive Biomedicine (Tehran, Iran) and 160 fertile women at health care centers, between May 2016 and June 2017. Sexual function was assessed by Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 25.00) and differences were regarded statistically significant at p < 0. 05. Result(s): The prevalence of female sexual dysfunction was 98.8% in women with PCOS, 100.0% in those with endometriosis, and 80.0% in those with male factor infertility. Overall, 36.2% of the enrolled fertile women were suffering from sexual dysfunction. Conclusion(s): There was an association between the prevalence of female sexual dysfunction or individual domain scores of the FSFI, and infertility etiologies. Therefore, infertility care providers are required to take this into consideration and develop preventive strategies in this regard. Plain summary: Infertility as a major health care problem affects an estimated 8-12% of couples of reproductive age globally and sexuality as an important part of women's health, can be affected by infertility. In this study, the prevalence of sexual dysfunction among women with the most common causes of infertility has been evaluated. The present study was conducted on 240 infertile females with infertility due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS, n = 80), endometriosis (n = 80) and male factor (n = 80) at Royan Institute (Tehran, Iran) and 160 fertile women at health care centers, between May 2016 and June 2017. Sexual function was assessed by Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI); a brief self-report measure of sexual functioning. Results highlight that the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women with endometriosis and PCOS was higher than in other groups. As, the prevalence of female sexual dysfunction was 98.8% in women with PCOS, 100.0% in those with endometriosis, and 80.0% in those with male factor infertility. In total, 36.2% of the enrolled fertile women were suffering from sexual dysfunction. The results point to an association between the prevalence of female sexual dysfunction and causes of infertility. Therefore, infertility care providers are required to take this into consideration and develop preventive strategies in this regard.Copyright Â© 2022, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: More remains to be known about polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) among overweight/obese adolescents across different ethnicities especially in regards to mental illness as an associated comorbidity. Objective(s): To determine the prevalence of PCOS among overweight and obese adolescents and to evaluate known risk factors for PCOS in a diverse population. Method(s): Charts of patients at an Adolescent Clinic between April 1, 2016 and July 30, 2018 were filtered using: obese, overweight and body mass index (BMI) >85%. Charts were reviewed to identify the presence of PCOS using National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, race/ethnicity and known risk factors for PCOS [lipid, BMI, glycated hemoglobin (HA1c), blood pressure (BP)] and mental health conditions associated with PCOS (anxiety/depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation). Result(s): Patients with PCOS were more likely to have elevated lipids (19.6% vs. 9.9%, p = 0.05), be obese (67.4% vs. 50.9%, p = 0.03), and have acanthosis nigricans (68.9% vs. 28.2%, p =< 0.001). PCOS was more common among non-Hispanic patients (77.9%) vs. Hispanic patients (57.8%). There was no difference in the prevalence of depression/anxiety (37% vs. 33%, respectively, p = 0.590) or self - harm/suicidal ideation (17% vs. 17%, p = 0.96) in patients with and without PCOS. In a logistic regression model, after adjusting for all demographics and clinical features, ethnicity, acanthosis nigricans and BMI were significant risk factors for PCOS. Conclusion(s): Patients with PCOS are more likely to be obese, hyperlipidemic, have acanthosis nigricans and be of non-Hispanic ethnicity. However, there was no difference in the prevalence of depression/anxiety and self-harm/suicidal ideation among adolescents with or without PCOS.Copyright Â© 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

N2  - Objective: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) report delayed diagnosis of the condition and receiving inadequate information at diagnosis. No studies have investigated the diagnosis experiences of adolescents with PCOS. Our objective was to investigate the adolescents' experiences of PCOS diagnosis and their concerns about the condition. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Patient(s): Eighty-six adolescents (aged 13-19 years) were diagnosed with PCOS by a medical practitioner. Adolescents were recruited consecutively from paediatric and women's outpatient hospital clinics in South Australia and online PCOS support organisations in Australia and the United Kingdom (May 2017-June 2019). Measurements: PCOS diagnosis experience and information received at the time of diagnosis were evaluated using a validated questionnaire. Result(s): The majority of the adolescents (n = 67, 78%) were diagnosed with PCOS in less than 1 year from their first doctor's visit but 11 (13%) were diagnosed more than 2 years from that visit. Fifty-three adolescents (66%) saw 1-2 health professionals before the diagnosis was made. Forty-nine adolescents (57%) were satisfied with the overall diagnosis experience but adolescents were either dissatisfied or reported that the information was not mentioned after diagnosis in relation to lifestyle management (n = 47, 55%), long-term complications (n = 53, 62%) and emotional support and counselling (n = 65, 76%). Conclusion(s): The majority of adolescent girls with PCOS are receiving a timely diagnosis, but delayed diagnosis still occurs in a minority of adolescents. Current information provided at diagnosis is not meeting the needs of adolescents and is a lost opportunity for preventive healthcare at a critical transition to adult care period.Copyright Â© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To explore clinicians' and women's views and experiences with managing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): Semi-structured interviews with 36 clinicians and 26 women with PCOS. Clinicians were recruited through advertising via relevant professional organisations, snowballing and contacting clinics across Australia. Women with PCOS were recruited through social media advertising. Transcribed audio-recordings were analysed thematically using Framework analysis. Result(s): Findings across women with PCOS and clinician interviews were organised into three themes. Both women and clinicians experienced 1) challenges with managing PCOS, often stemming from the disparate and wide spectrum of presentations, issues with current treatment options (including limited evidence) and the long-term nature of management. Both spoke about 2) online information about PCOS and alternative treatments, including lack of relevant information and widespread misinformation. 3) Follow-up and continuity of care, where we found notable differences between women's and clinicians' expectations. Conclusion(s): This is the first study to explore both clinicians' and women's experiences with managing PCOS, illustrating several challenges in managing this heterogeneous condition. Practice implications: Clarifying and addressing patient expectations, providing personalised counselling and information according to PCOS phenotype and a multidisciplinary approach may reduce uncertainty and improve patient-centred care.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among women. Given the prevalence of this disease in adolescent girls as well as its serious physical, psychological, and social consequences, the present study aimed to explore the health system-related needs for healthy nutritional behaviors in adolescent girls with PCOS. METHOD(S): This qualitative content analysis was conducted in Shiraz, Iran between November 2016 and October 2017. Eighteen Adolescent girls with PCOS and 15 healthcare providers (midwives, gynecologists, nutritionists, and endocrinologists) were selected through purposeful sampling with maximum variation strategy. Data were collected through individual in-depth and semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and field note, and simultaneously analyzed using the conventional qualitative content analysis method. RESULT(S): Three main categories that appeared included: 1) education and counseling on healthy nutrition and support for adolescent girls with PCOS with sub-categories of "empowering adolescent girls with PCOS to adopt healthy nutritional behaviors", "providing services and education about healthy nutritional behaviors as a team", and "the health team attention to the concerns of adolescent girls with PCOS and closely following the disease status, 2) solving communication problems with sub-categories of "proper interactions and building trust between health team members and adolescent girls" and "proper interactions between members of the health team", and 3) developing the optimal structure for providing health services with sub-categories of "solving problems related to human resources, "promoting the position of health issues related to adolescent girls in the health system", and "promoting policy-making in the field of nutritional health of adolescent girls". CONCLUSION(S): Based on the results of the present study, necessary measures should be taken to educate and advise on healthy nutrition, and to support adolescent girls with PCOS. The desired structure should also be developed to provide health services to these girls. By solving communication problems and building trust between the members of the health team and these girls, one can guide them to adopt healthy nutritional behaviors.Copyright Â© 2022.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition affecting up to 13% of reproductive-aged women. Weight and lifestyle management are key initial treatment strategies for individuals with PCOS, as recommended in international evidence-based guidelines. Allied health professionals, including dietitians, exercise physiologists, and psychologists, are crucial in delivering support for lifestyle and weight management. OBJECTIVE(S): Our aim was to explore the barriers and enablers to lifestyle and weight management for individuals with PCOS from the perspectives of allied health professionals. DESIGN: This was a qualitative study using a phenomenology approach to understand the allied health professionals lived experiences managing the lifestyles of individuals with PCOS. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with allied health professionals (ie, dietitians, exercise physiologists, and psychologist). Interviews were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed. Transcripts were coded inductively and analyzed thematically. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants were 15 allied health professionals (ie, 9 dietitians, 5 exercise physiologists, and 1 psychologist) involved in the management of PCOS in Australia (n = 10 in Victoria, n = 5 in other states) and interviewed between June and September 2019. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Barriers and enablers of allied health professionals relating to the provision of lifestyle and weight management in individuals with PCOS were analyzed. RESULT(S): Barriers relating to individuals with PCOS included insufficient knowledge on lifestyle management; lack of time; socioeconomic disadvantage preventing access to lifestyle support; and psychological issues, such as eating disorders or depression. Barriers relating to health professionals included insufficient knowledge about PCOS and insufficient time during consultation. Barriers relating to the health system included lifestyle recommendations in the PCOS guidelines that are too general and weight-focused, funding system that does not facilitate long-term care, and low integration of care among health professionals. CONCLUSION(S): Barriers for the individual, health professional, and health system all need to be addressed to improve the implementation of lifestyle management in PCOS care to optimize consistency with the PCOS international evidence-based guidelines.Copyright Â© 2022 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

N2  - There is a paucity of data regarding the safety and efficacy of antidepressant therapy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and depression. The effect of antidepressant medications on circulating prolactin levels is of concern in this patient population. We aimed to evaluate the effect of sertraline on depression severity and serum prolactin levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and mild-to-moderate depression. In a parallel-design, two-center, randomized controlled trial, we stratified participants according to their baseline prolactin level into normal (<25 ng/mL) and high (>=25 ng/mL) prolactin groups. Each group was randomized to receive 50 mg daily sertraline (up-titrated after 25 mg daily for 1 week) or placebo. The enrolling physicians, outcome assessors, and study subjects were all blind to the treatment. Depression severity was assessed by the Hamilton depression rating scale at baseline, the third, and the sixth weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was a change in depression severity. Prolactin levels were checked at baseline and after 6 weeks, and the safety outcome was the alteration in prolactin levels. Overall, 513 women were screened for eligibility in two outpatient clinics. Ultimately, 74 (38 normal prolactin and 36 high prolactin level) individuals were randomized. After 6 weeks of follow-up, depression severity was significantly reduced among patients who received sertraline regardless of the baseline prolactin levels (all between subjects P < 0.001). Furthermore, there was no difference in prolactin levels between the sertraline and placebo arms in normal (P = 0.80) or high prolactin (P = 0.21) groups. Sertraline is a well-tolerated and effective choice for treating depression in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Future studies with longer follow-up periods are required to draw more robust conclusions.Copyright Â© 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinological disorder affecting women of reproductive age, affecting 8-13% in this group. Women with PCOS are more likely to have excess BMI, which in turn exacerbates the symptoms of PCOS in these women. The latest evidence-based guideline recommends lifestyle management as the first-line treatment for PCOS. However, the implementation of this recommendation through health services faces a significant challenge. As part of the mapping of the implementation plan for lifestyle management in PCOS, citizen panels and semi-structured interviews were conducted to capture the voices of consumers. Women with PCOS expressed the need for multidisciplinary, integrated care as a recurrent theme. Other important considerations included health professionals who listen and are open to learning about PCOS, the empowerment of women to self-manage PCOS and the provision of peer support. Women with PCOS also expressed the key recommendation of focusing on practical skills when providing lifestyle advice. Within that, both individual and group lifestyle sessions were valued for privacy and peer support respectively and delivery by a dietitian is preferred. These recommendations by women with PCOS should be considered when developing the implementation plan for the PCOS lifestyle guideline.Copyright Â© 2021. Thieme. All rights reserved.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disorder and many women are dissatisfied with their healthcare under the current fragmented health services. Here, we review existing literature on PCOS healthcare services and qualitatively evaluate an integrated PCOS service based on experiences of women with PCOS. Limited prior PCOS-dedicated services have been studied and their quantitative and efficacy-focused evaluations are summarized. Here, we also provide a broader PCOS service evaluation via semistructured interviews and surveys, with thematic analysis based on a predetermined evaluation framework. Fifteen women completed interviews and surveys. Overall the integrated, evidence-based PCOS service was well-received and women were generally satisfied with appropriateness, effectiveness, and reported positive health impact resulting from the service. Integrated care, tailored treatments, education, lifestyle support, and laser therapy were highly valued. Patients reported improvements on symptoms, understanding and confidence in managing PCOS, and emotional well-being. Elements of efficiency in the initial stages, awareness and communication, and the need for service expansion and tensions between evidence-based treatments and patient preferences were also captured to guide improvement. Further research into models of care is recommended to meet the needs of women with PCOS.Copyright Â© 2021. Thieme. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Even though polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive disorder affecting young women, its impact on their sexual health is not well known. Aim(s): To examine the different aspects of female sexuality in young women with PCOS and attempt to associate hormonal changes and ovulatory status with their sexual function. Method(s): Anthropometric characteristics, hormonal levels and sexual function based on the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire were assessed in 76 young women with PCOS and 133 matched controls. Outcome(s): Sexual function is significantly impaired in young women with PCOS. Result(s): Women with PCOS demonstrated lower scores than controls in arousal (5.04 +/- 1.19 vs 4.48 +/- 1.44, P <.001), lubrication (5.29 +/- 1.17 vs 4.69 +/- 1.54, P <.001), orgasm (4.78 +/- 1.40 vs 4.11 +/- 1.61, P =.001), satisfaction (5.22 +/- 1.10 vs 4.78 +/- 1.31, P =.016), and total score of the FSFI (29.51 +/- 5.83 vs 26.76 +/- 6.81, P <.001), even after correction for BMI. When corrected for total testosterone, the domains of lubrication, satisfaction, and total score of FSFI remained significantly impaired in women with PCOS (P values.037,.024, &.044 respectively). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for the effect of BMI and hormone levels, dysfunction in orgasm, satisfaction and the total FSFI score were still 3-4 times more common in PCOS (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 3.54, P =.020; 2.96, P =.050; 3.87, P =.027). Even though no statistically significant differences were observed between women with ovulatory PCOS and controls, we detected statistically significant differences in all domains of sexual function apart from pain between controls and PCOS women with anovulation (desire P value.04, arousal P value <.001, lubrication P value <.001, orgasm P value.001, satisfaction P value.001 and FSFI total score P value <.001). Clinical Implications: Women with PCOS have compromised sexual function, which is independent of their BMI and highly dependent on their ovulatory status. Strengths and Limitations: This is the first study in women with PCOS that implicates anovulation as a risk factor for sexual impairment in PCOS. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms implicated and to examine the effect of PCOS therapy on the patients' sexual function. Conclusion(s): The adverse effect of PCOS status on the female sexual function is independent of BMI and only partially dependent on hormonal changes characterizing the syndrome. Anovulation appears to be the major determinant of sexual impairment among women with PCOS. Mantzou D, Stamou MI, Armeni AK, et al.

N2  - Background This study was undertaken to explore the treatment-seeking pathways traversed by women with PCOS and elicit their behavior, experiences and perspectives regarding it. Methods This concurrent mixed-method study was conducted on 18-40 years old women diagnosed with PCOS at the Gynecology outpatient department, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India. Of the 275 women, who were administered a questionnaire to elicit their treatment-seeking behavior, 62 willing participants were subjected to in-depth interviews. Quantitative responses were descriptively analyzed and presented as count, proportion, mean or median. Framework analysis was performed for the qualitative data. The findings of both types of data were triangulated to construct the pathways to treatment traversed by PCOS patients. Findings Many (~45%) respondents had no information regarding PCOS. Only 9.1% received some information from their doctors. Though the internet was the primary source of information for 37.5% of respondents, they expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of information. Multiple health care agencies were consulted by most (85.8%) of the respondents. Allopathy was the preferred choice of treatment. The average delay in initiating the treatment was 3 months. The major reasons for this were ignorance, the concept of 'normality' and 'endurance'. Deviations from the normal self (like irregular-menstruation, obesity, hirsutism, infertility) were the concern that led them to consult a doctor. They were also dissatisfied with the treatment due to a late diagnosis, lack of relief, taboo, side-effects, expenses involved and the need for repeated laboratory tests. Participants' course of treatment was influenced by the interplay of individual, distress, health-system, and social-economic factors. Conclusions Women with PCOS were dissatisfied with the quality of the information and treatment received. There were treatment delays. The patients consulted multiple health agencies, including indigenous therapies, in the hope of relief. The findings provide an empirical basis on points to focus on for building better coping strategies for managing the condition.Copyright Â© 2021 Kaur et al.

N2  - The objectives of this study are to assess the prevalence of psychological complaints and changes in sexual function in infertile PCOS women compared with patients with other infertility causes (tubal and male infertility factors) and to identify the predisposing factors. An observational study with three cohorts of infertile women was designed including 37 PCOS patients, 36 women with tubal factor, and 31 women with male factor. Clinical history and physical examination were carried out in all patients. All subjects completed the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaires. Women with infertility due to PCOS showed a significantly higher prevalence of depressive (48.6 vs 19.4 and 12.9%, p < 0.01) and anxiety symptoms (21.6 vs 5.6 and 3.2%, p = 0.041) than respondents of reference groups. Sexual function in PCOS subjects was impaired in the areas orgasm and satisfaction (p < 0.01 for both) compared to patients of reference groups. Clinical, biochemical hyperandrogenism, and overweight were associated with a higher incidence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the infertile PCOS group (p < 0.01 for all). Besides, the severity of anxiety symptoms was associated with the number of medically assisted reproduction attempts (p = 0.014). Weight gain and age (p = 0.04 and p = 0.047) were associated with impaired sexual functioning. The relation between reduced sexuality and depressive/anxiety symptoms was found (p = 0.038 and p = 0.012, respectively). Infertile PCOS patients showed the highest prevalence of psychological complaints and some impairment in their sexual functioning. Mental health and sexual functioning need to be part of the routine clinical screening of every PCOS patient. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT03306459) https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03306459?cond=PCOS&cntry=ES&city=Barcelona&draw=2&rank=3Copyright Â© 2021, Society for Reproductive Investigation.

N2  - AIM: The 2018 evidence-based polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) guidelines recommend lifestyle management as first-line treatment. This study aims to understand the preferred intervention characteristics of a PCOS lifestyle program from the perspectives of women with PCOS to inform the translation of the guidelines into practice. METHOD(S): Women with self-reported PCOS residing in Australia took part in semi-structured interviews (n = 20) and an online survey (n = 286). The survey and interview schedule were developed using the template for intervention description and replication checklist. RESULT(S): Women want to take part in a lifestyle program (94.6%) and use government-subsidised sessions to attend (83%). Sessions of 45 to 60minutes (75%) costing less than AUD$50 are preferred (60%). Topics of most interest related to sustainable daily physical activity (58%), overcoming non-hungry eating (54%), PCOS-specific diets (51%) and how to overcome barriers to behaviour change (45%). A delivery mode that combines online and in-person support is preferred (53%). Women are in need of long-term professional lifestyle support (6-12months) that provides evidence-based, PCOS-specific, personalised prescription. Multidisciplinary support from a range of PCOS-trained professions is also preferred to address women's physical, psychological and emotional needs. CONCLUSION(S): Women with PCOS are willing to take part in lifestyle programs that are low cost, long term, evidence based, PCOS-specific and provide practical strategies for nutrition and physical activity changes. Future online and in-person PCOS programs are strongly recommended to incorporate these findings to improve program engagement and patient satisfaction.Copyright Â© 2021 Dietitians Australia.

N2  - To personalize lifestyle advice for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and obesity, detailed information regarding dietary intake, eating behavior, physical activity levels, and quality of life (QoL) may be useful. We aimed to investigate in a post-hoc cross-sectional analysis within a large multicenter randomized controlled trial in women with infertility whether there are significant differences in dietary intake (vegetables, fruits, sugary drinks, alcoholic beverages, savory snacks, and sweet snacks); eating behavior (emotional eating, external eating, and restricted eating); physical activity; and QoL between women with PCOS and obesity and non-PCOS obese controls. Participants were asked to complete the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), the Short QUestionnaire to ASsess Health-enhancing physical activity (SQUASH), and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) at study entry (PCOS: n = 170; non-PCOS: n = 321, mean BMI: 36). Linear and binary (multinomial) logistic regressions were used, and the analyses were adjusted for age, waist-hip circumference ratio, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). No statistically significant differences in dietary intake or physical activity were observed between the two groups. The overall score of emotional eating was 34.6 +/- 11.2 in the PCOS group and 34.1 +/- 11.3 in the non-PCOS group (p = 0.11). QoL scores (physical and mental) did not differ between PCOS and non-PCOS women. These findings suggest that infertile women with PCOS and obesity and infertile non-PCOS obese controls do not have different dietary habits and have similar mental and physical QoL.Copyright Â© 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Obesity is associated with the development of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and contributes substantially to metabolic abnormalities in women with PCOS. The study aimed to describe and compare the practices of physicians in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of obesity in patients with PCOS. Method(s): Reproductive endocrinologists (Repro-Endo) and obstetrician-gynecologists (non-reproductive medicine specialty, OB-Gyn) in China participated in a survey, and their responses were analyzed using chi2 tests, Fisher exact tests, and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Result(s): The study analyzed 1318 survey responses (85.8% OB-Gyn; 97.3% women). Body mass index was the most common diagnostic criterion for obesity; only 1.3% of participants measured waist circumference to identify abdominal obesity. More Repro-Endo participants (25% of all participants) enquired about the psychological problems of patients with obesity than OB-Gyn participants, and 42.5% of participants reported ordering both a lipid profile and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for patients with obesity and PCOS. Multivariable analysis, that included physician's specialty, age, hospital grade, and number of patients with PCOS seen annually, revealed that OB-Gyn participants were less likely to order OGTT (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.2-0.4) and lipid profile (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.3) than Repro-Endo participants. The most common treatments for patients with PCOS were lifestyle modification (> 95%) and metformin (> 80%). More Repro-Endo participants prescribed metformin at a dose of 1.5 g/day compared with OB-Gyn (47.6% vs. 26.3%), and more OB-Gyn participants reported being unclear about the appropriate dosage of metformin for patients with obesity and PCOS (8.9% vs. 1.6%). Conclusion(s): Our survey identified knowledge gaps in metabolic screening for patients with obesity and PCOS and a disparity in the evaluation and treatment of obesity in PCOS among different specialties. Similarly, it highlights the need to improve obesity management education for physicians caring for women with PCOS.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: To describe the diagnostic criteria used and their application accuracy in the practice of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) caring among obstetricians and gynaecologists across China. Method(s): This was an Online cross-sectional survey of Obstetricians and gynecologists involved in PCOS caring conducted via the largest continuing education platform of obstetrics and gynecology across China from September 2019 to November 2019. Result(s): A total of 2,328 respondents were eligible for the final analysis. Of these, 94.5 % were general obstetricians and gynaecologists (Ge-ObGyn), and 5.5 % were reproductive endocrinologists (Re-ObGyn). Overall, the most frequently used criteria were the Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Society (AE-PCOS) criteria (48.2 %), followed by the Rotterdam criteria (35.7 %) and NIH criteria (12.1 %). Of the respondents, 31.3 % used their diagnostic criteria in their clinical practice. More respondents who chose the Rotterdam criteria could accurately apply the diagnostic criteria than those who chose the AE-PCOS criteria (41.2 % vs. 32.1 %, P < 0.001). Compared with Ge-ObGyn, Re-ObGyn were less likely to use the AE-PCOS criteria (adjusted odds ratio, 0.513; 95 % CI, 0.328-0.802; P < 0.05) and 1.492 times more likely to accurately use their criteria (95 % CI, 1.014-2.196; P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Less than one-third of obstetricians and gynaecologists across China could accurately use the diagnostic criteria they choose to diagnose PCOS. There is an urgent need to train obstetricians and gynaecologists on PCOS diagnosis in an effort to improve the medical care quality of patients with PCOS.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and the related lockdown measures presented a significant risk to physical and mental wellbeing in affected populations. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are predisposed to several cardio-metabolic risk factors which increase the susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and also exhibit increased likelihood of impaired mental health wellbeing. Therefore, these women who usually receive care from multiple primary and specialist healthcare services may be disproportionately impacted by this pandemic and the related restrictions. This study aimed to explore the lived experience of the first UK national lockdown as a woman with PCOS. Method(s): As part of a larger cross-sectional study, 12 women with PCOS living in the UK during the first national COVID-19 lockdown were recruited to a qualitative study. Telephone interviews were conducted in June/July of 2020, and data collected were subjected to thematic analysis. Result(s): Five themes were identified. "My PCOS Journey" describes participants' experiences of diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management of their PCOS. "Living Through Lockdown" describes the overall experience and impact of the lockdown on all aspects of participants' lives. "Self-care and Managing Symptoms" describe multiple challenges to living well with PCOS during the lockdown, including lack of access to supplies and services, and disruption to weight management. "Healthcare on Hold" describes the uncertainty and anxiety associated with delays in accessing specialised healthcare for a range of PCOS aspects, including fertility treatment. "Exacerbating Existing Issues" captures the worsening of pre-existing mental health issues, and an increase in health anxiety and feelings of isolation. Conclusion(s): For the women with PCOS in this study, the COVID-19 pandemic and the first national lockdown was mostly experienced as adding to the pre-existing challenges of living with their condition. The mental health impact experienced by the study participants was increased due to lack of access to their normal support strategies, limitations on healthcare services and uncertainty about their risk of COVID-19.Copyright Â© 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Objective: The objective of the study is to investigate sleep disorders in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and determine the relationship of sleep disorders with the metabolic and psychogenic aspects of PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): This case-control study was conducted between October 1, 2019, and March 1, 2020, at the gynaecology and neurology outpatient clinics of a tertiary hospital. The study included 73 patients diagnosed with PCOS and 63 healthy women volunteers. Testosterone, fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels of all the participants were measured. All study participants completed Beck's depression inventory (BDI), Beck's anxiety inventory (BAI), Epworth Sleepiness scale (ESS), Berlin questionnaire (BQ), insomnia severity index (ISI), and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). The presence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) was assessed according to the international RLS study group criteria. Result(s): According to PSQI scores, 61.6% of patients with PCOS and 34.9% of healthy controls had a poor sleep quality (p=0.003). The PCOS group had significantly higher PSQI, ESS, ISI, BAI, BDI, and BQ scores than the control group (p=0.002, p=0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). Although 23.3% of patients with PCOS met the RLS criteria, this rate was only 6.3% in the control group (p=0.013). There was a positive correlation between insulin resistance and PSQI (r=0.320, p=0.006). Conclusion(s): This study's results indicate that PCOS may be a risk factor for several sleep disorders. In addition, the cumulative impact of both the organic and psychogenic changes caused by PCOS may lead to sleep disorders.Â©Copyright 2021 by Turkish Sleep Medicine Society.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multi-symptom disorder linked with a range of metabolic and hormonal disturbances. Psychological and sexual aspects of PCOS also need to be considered. Objective of the study: This study aimed to assess sexual satisfaction (SS) in PCOS patients and eumenorrheic controls (CON). The relationships between SS, depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and hormonal and metabolic profiles were evaluated. Method(s): In this study, 190 patients with PCOS (mean age 26.34 +/- 5.47 years) and 197 age-matched CON (mean age 27.12 +/- 4.97 years) were enrolled. All subjects completed Polish version of the Sexual Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ), WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CESD-R) questionnaire. Fasting blood samples were collected to assess hormonal, lipid, and glucose profiles. Anthropometric measures were collected. Metabolic syndrome (MS) was evaluated according to the IDF-AHA/NHLBI criteria. Result(s): Patients with PCOS and MS had lower SS vs non-MS-PCOS. There were no significant differences in the level of SS, presence of depressive symptoms, or HRQoL between PCOS and CON (P > 0.05). Negative correlations were found between the SS level and BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio in PCOS women. However, overweight or obese PCOS women did not differ in SS levels vs normal-weight PCOS patients. The social dimension of WHOQOL-BREF was the only significant predictor of SS in PCOS patients. Conclusion(s): SS in PCOS women appears to be undisturbed. However, MS in PCOS patients could negatively influence SS. The level of SS should be assessed in PCOS women, especially if MS is present.Copyright Â© 2021 The authors.

N2  - Study Objective: Based on updated guidelines and expressed patient needs, we created a multidisciplinary clinic including endocrinology, gynecology/adolescent medicine, dermatology, psychology, and nutrition to provide comprehensive care to adolescent girls with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We describe the patient population presenting to this clinic, and prescribing patterns when a multidisciplinary approach is used. Design(s): Retrospective chart review. Setting(s): Tertiary care hospital. Participant(s): Female patients, aged 11-24 years, presenting for initial assessment in a multidisciplinary PCOS clinic. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Medical history, physical examination findings, laboratory measurements and prescribed therapies. Result(s): A total of 92 patients seen from 2014 to 2018 are described (age 15.9 years, range 11-24 years, body mass index 35.6 kg/m2, range 19.9-53.5). Metabolic syndrome features were common: 26% had a prediabetes hemoglobin A1c (>5.6%), 83% had a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) <50 mg/dL, 40% had a systolic blood pressure >120 mm Hg, and 43% had an alanine aminotransferase level of >30 U/L. Dermatologic findings included acne 93%, hirsutism 38%, acanthosis nigricans 85%, hidradenitis suppurativa 16%, and androgenic alopecia 2%. Of the patients, 33% had a diagnosis of depression or anxiety, 16% of patients had a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, and an additional 59% had symptoms warranting a sleep study The most commonly prescribed medications were topical acne preparations (62%), followed by estrogen-containing hormonal therapy (56%) and metformin (40%). Conclusion(s): In adolescents with PCOS and obesity, metabolic, dermatologic, and psychologic co-morbidities are common. The use of a multidisciplinary clinic model including dermatology in addition to endocrinology, gynecology, psychology, and lifestyle experts provides care for most aspects of PCOS.Copyright Â© 2021 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology

N2  - Background: The 2018 Evidence-Based Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Clinical Guidelines recommend lifestyle management as first-line treatment for PCOS, yet implementation of PCOS lifestyle programs into practice is not well understood. Objective(s): To complete systematic intervention mapping by identifying the facilitators and barriers to lifestyle management in women with PCOS using the theoretical domains framework (TDF) and the Capacity, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour model (COM-B). Patient involvement: Women (N = 20) in Australian with PCOS were interviewed. Method(s): Telephone semi-structured interviews. Result(s): Nine themes mapped onto seven TDF domains and the COM-B. Capability: psychological co-morbidities, knowledge and awareness of lifestyle change and ability to identify and resolve barriers. Opportunity: presence of other medical conditions, access to practical resources and availability of social support. Motivation: outcomes expectancies of lifestyle behaviour, personal values, enjoyment and readiness to change and the impact of stress on lifestyle choices. Discussion(s): This is the first study to explore barriers and facilitators to lifestyle change from the perspectives of women with PCOS using the TDF and COM-B. Addressing these themes will facilitate patient-centred care and long-term behaviour change. Practical implications: May increase the efficacy and effectiveness of PCOS lifestyle programs and reduce the risk of PCOS-associated disease in this population.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Participant(s): The study population comprised 153 patients with PCOS and 161 healthy adolescents. Interventions and Main Outcome Measure(s): The Personal Information Form, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, Children's Depression Inventory, and Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale were administered to all of the participants who took part in the study. Result(s): The Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale scores were lower in the PCOS group than in the control group (P < .001). In addition, the scores for the Children's Depression Inventory were also significantly higher in the PCOS group (P < .001). The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children scores showed statistically significant higher levels of state anxiety and trait anxiety in the PCOS group (P < .001). Conclusion(s): Adolescents with PCOS had lower self-concept scores, greater anxiety levels, and increased depressive symptoms than the healthy controls. Future studies are needed to examine the psychiatric problems in adolescents with PCOS.Copyright Â© 2020 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Aim: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinological disorder in reproductive age and criterion have recently been revised for adolescent age group. Research regarding effects of PCOS on psychological well-being is limited; and majority of the studies are conducted in adult patients. We aimed to examine psychological effects of PCOS in adolescents who are diagnosed using latest criterion. Method(s): Cases were divided into PCOS and control groups according to their clinical, ultrasonographical and biochemical features. Beck depression inventory (BDI), State & Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-I/II), Self-Confidence Scale (SCS), Multidimensional Peer-Victimization Scale (MPVS) and Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A) were used in psychiatric evaluation. Result(s): There were no statistically significant differences between groups regarding psychiatric scale scores. However, several biochemical parameters (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, 17-hydroxyprogesterone) and clinical (Ferriman-Gallwey score [FGS]) of hyperandrogenism affected certain indicators of psychological well-being such as social anxiety, low self-esteem and peer victimization. In some psychiatric scales, biochemical indicators were found correlated while clinical indicators were not. Conclusion(s): Similar psychiatric scale scores between groups may indicate preliminary stages for adolescent PCOS in which endocrinological, physical and social factors have not yet reached their full potential for their effect on emergence of psychological problems; thus making this age group critical for interventions of prevention measures. In addition, while examining the effects of PCOS on psychological well-being, biochemical parameters of hyperandrogenism might be as effective as physical manifestations (FGS); and high levels of biochemical parameters of hyperandrogenism might also affect psychological state.Copyright Â© 2020 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology

N2  - Background: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate sexual and marital satisfaction in couples with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A case-control study was conducted on 90 couples with PCOS and 90 healthy couples as a control group. Three measures were used to evaluate sexual function and marital satisfaction: the female sexual function index (FSFI), the Larson sexual satisfaction, and the ENRICH marital satisfaction measures. Result(s): The results of this study show that the mean scores of sexual function, sexual satisfaction, and marital satisfaction were significantly lower in PCOS couples compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Infertility was reported as the strongest predictive factor for sexual function and marital satisfaction in couples with PCOS (P < 0.05). Compared to the control group, sexual and marital satisfaction was lower in patients with PCOS and their partners. Conclusion(s): Since infertility is the strongest predictive factor for the sexual health of couples with PCOS and sexual health is important in family health and marital life, sexual counseling may prove beneficial for these patients.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to examine sexual function and its correlates among infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in comparison with their non-PCOS counterparts. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case-control study, 209 infertile women (116 PCOS and 93 non-PCOS) from Tehran, Iran, were evaluated in February and March 2018. Female sexual function index (FSFI), hormonal status, and documented reports of hyperandrogenic manifestations of the patients were investigated. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 32.00 +/- 5.00 years old. Eighty-four (40.2%) patients including 42.2% of the PCOS patients and 37.6% of the non-PCOS cases (P>0.05), were suspected of female sexual dysfunction (FSD). The most impaired functions in both groups were desire and arousal. Sexual function was not significantly different between the groups. However, PCOS women had more orgasm problems and acne worsened their sexual function. Total FSFI was positively associated with prolactin level but negatively associated with central obesity in the non-PCOS group; it was negatively correlated with marital duration in the PCOS group. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and pain, prolactin level and lubrication, and central obesity and arousal were correlated in the non-PCOS women. Prolactin level and orgasm, marital duration and arousal, and marital duration and the total FSFI were correlated in the PCOS women. Conclusion(s): Sexual function was similarly low in infertile PCOS and non-PCOS women. However, orgasm problems and the negative effect of acne varied between the two groups. Further investigations may target how hormonal profile may affect sexual function. Practitioners should scrutinize the specific impaired sexual domains and their correlated conditions in PCOS women, notably orgasm, acne, and prolactin level. Interventions should be well tailored based on particular needs of infertile PCOS women.Copyright Â© 2021, Royan Institute (ACECR). All rights reserved.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been proposed to be associated with several mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, diminished sexual satisfaction, and lowered health-related quality of life, etc. A systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature was conducted comparing the mental health of women with and without PCOS. Ten English and Chinese databases were searched up to 12/31/2018. Random-effects models were introduced, and subgroup analysis, sensitivity test, and meta-regression were carried out to determine the source for heterogeneity among studies. Forty-six studies, including 30,989 participants (9265 women with PCOS and 25,638 controls), were qualified for review according to the inclusion criteria. Twenty-eight studies reported depression symptoms, 22 studies were on anxiety, 16 studies showed quality of life (QoL) status, 12 studies were about sexual dysfunction, five on emotional distress, four on binge eating, and four on somatization. Women with PCOS reported significantly higher depression (SMD = 0.64; 95% CI 0.50-0.78), anxiety (SMD = 0.63; 95% CI 0.50-0.77), lower QoL (SMD = - 0.55; 95% CI -0.69 to -0.40), and not significant sexual dysfunction (SMD = - 0.24; 95% CI - 0.49 to 0.01). Studies from different countries, adopting various diagnosis criteria, using diverse instruments, as well as in different years, have reported heterogenetic results. Women with PCOS in China reported a larger effect size of depression and anxiety than patients from other countries. The results of this study have indicated that women with PCOS suffer from depression, anxiety, and experience a lower quality of life, whereas their sexual function is not distinct from that of healthy women. Psychological health care interventions for women with PCOS were addressed.Copyright Â© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: Lifestyle modification plays a key role in weight management and chronic disease prevention in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS experience challenges in adopting and maintaining healthy lifestyle behaviours, which may be related to health literacy. The aims of this study were to explore the health literacy needs of women with PCOS in lifestyle and weight management to inform research and practice. METHOD(S): Ten women with PCOS participated in focus groups and semi-structured telephone interviews on lifestyle and weight management in PCOS. RESULT(S): For functional health literacy, women with PCOS are highly motivated for lifestyle and weight management due to the long-term consequences of PCOS. For interactive health literacy, barriers included delayed diagnosis and poor communication. Women with PCOS were resourceful in accessing a wide range of weight management services but some experience barriers such as costs or the feelings of embarrassment associated with accessing relevant services. For critical health literacy, no facilitators and barriers could be identified for the domain of participation in making decisions for health. CONCLUSION(S): Women with PCOS experience facilitators and barriers in functional and interactive health literacy in lifestyle and weight management. SO WHAT?: Future interventions should seek to further understand and address these gaps in health literacy by increasing weight management skills through behaviour change techniques, improving health professional-patient communication through tools such as question prompt lists, enhancing peer support by increasing distributed health literacy in PCOS support groups and by providing opportunities for co-design of interventions.Copyright Â© 2021 Australian Health Promotion Association.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine syndrome that disproportionally affects women of childbearing age (~8% to 13% of women worldwide). If unmanaged, it can lead to chronic, lifelong complications. Over the past decade, improvements in diagnostic guidelines have not produced an expected reduction in the diagnostic timeframe. We examined the potential reasons underlying this diagnosis delay. Participants first constructed a diagnostic timeline and then charted and reflected on their diagnosis journeys. Through a reflexive thematic analysis, five themes represented the most common diagnostic trajectory: (a) dismissal of adolescents' early symptoms, (b) negative diagnostic encounters, (c) wariness of treatment options, (d) uncertainty for the future, and (e) self-education and advocacy. Our findings lead us to argue for education of physicians and allied professionals to strengthen patient-centered care delivery to women with a focus on building in training supports that include critically informed, social justice foundations.

N2  - Introduction: Knowledge is needed about the cultural experiences, patterns, and practices of American Indian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), so nurses can provide culturally congruent care. Method(s): A qualitative, ethnonursing study based on Leininger's theory of culture care diversity and universality. Data were collected from 13 key informants living on a reservation in the Western United States. Data were analyzed with Leininger's four phases of qualitative analysis. Result(s): Three universal themes were identified: (1) control of PCOS symptoms is important for the cultural well-being of tribal women, (2) culturally congruent PCOS education and health care are important with variations in approaches to treatment, and (3) tribal culture is important with variations in use of tribal practices. Discussion(s): Tribal culture affects the health care beliefs and practices of American Indian women with PCOS. The findings can be used to improve culturally congruent care for women with this chronic condition.

N2  - Objectives: This study aimed to compare endocrinologists' versus gynaecologists' approaches in using the Rotterdam criteria to diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted at Physiology Department, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between December 2017 and April 2018. A validated self-administered questionnaire in English was used to obtain information from endocrinologists and gynaecologists regarding their approaches to diagnosing PCOS. Each group's diagnostic use of the Rotterdam criteria, association between years of experience and clinical decision-making, clinical features leading to diagnosis and considerations in the diagnosis of biochemical parameters that define hyperandrogenism were evaluated. Result(s): A total of 132 physicians were included in this study (response rate: 27%); 77 (58.3%) were endocrinologists and 55 (41.7%) were gynaecologists. Most of the respondents (79.5%) had <=20 years of experience. A statistically significant difference was detected between the endocrinologists and gynaecologists (98.7% versus 81.8%; P = 0.001) in their consideration of hyperandrogenism in the diagnosis. The gynaecologists relied more on ovarian morphology than the endocrinologists did (76.4% versus 45.5%, P <0.0001). Physicians with more experience used ovarian ultrasonography more compared to those with less experience (P = 0.006). Conclusion(s): There was disparity in the diagnostic approaches of endocrinologists, who rely more on androgen levels for diagnosis of PCOS versus gynaecologists, who more frequently use an ovarian morphology assessment. Increased years of experience increased the rate of ultrasonography use for PCOS diagnosis in both groups.Â© Copyright 2020, Sultan Qaboos University Medical Journal, All Rights Reserved.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with decreased health-related qualityof life (HRQoL), but longitudinal data beyond the reproductive years are lacking, and theimpact of isolated PCOS symptoms is unclear. Objective(s): To study generic HRQoL using the 15D questionnaire, life satisfaction, and selfreported health status in women with PCOS symptoms at ages 31 and 46 years. Design(s): A longitudinal assessment using the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. Setting(s): General community. Participant(s): The 15D data were available for women reporting isolated oligo-amenorrhea (OA;at age 31 years, 214; and 46 years, 211), isolated hirsutism (H; 31 years, 211; and 46 years, 216),OA + H (PCOS; 31 years, 74; and 46 years, 75), or no PCOS symptoms (controls; 31 years, 1382;and 46 years, 1412). Data for life satisfaction and current health status were available for OA(31 years, 329; and 46 years, 247), H (31 years, 323; and 46 years, 238), PCOS (31 years, 125; and46 years, 86), control (31 years, 2182; and 46 years, 1613) groups.Intervention(s): None.Main Outcome Measure(s): 15D HRQoL, questionnaires on life satisfaction, and self-reportedhealth status. Result(s): HRQoL was lower at ages 31 and 46 in women with PCOS or H than in the controls.PCOS was an independent risk factor for low HRQoL, and the decrease in HRQoL in PCOS wassimilar to that of women with other chronic conditions, such as asthma, migraine, rheumatoidarthritis, and depression. The risk for low HRQoL in PCOS remained significant after adjustingfor body mass index, hyperandrogenism, and socioeconomic status. Mental distress was the strongest contributing factor to HRQoL. PCOS was also associated with a risk for low lifesatisfaction and a 4-fold risk for reporting a poor health status.Conclusions. Women with PCOS present with low HRQoL, decreased life satisfaction, anda poorer self-reported health status up to their late reproductive years. Assessments andinterventions aiming to improve HRQoL in PCOS should be targeted beyond the fertile age.Copyright Â© 2020 Endocrine Society. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common causes of infertility in women. Objective(s): The current study investigated mental and personality disorders in infertile women with and without PCOS. Method(s): This case-control study evaluated 400 infertile women who referred to the Infertility Center in Babol city (North of Iran). Participants were categorized into the case group (201 PCOS) and the control group (199 without PCOS). All of the participants completed the Millon Clinical Multi-axial Inventory-III (MCMI-III). Result(s): The mean scores for clinical personality patterns were significantly higher for six personality disorders (schiz-oid, avoidant, antisocial, depressive, sadistic, and negativistic) and for three classes of severe personality disorder patterns (schizotypal, borderline, and paranoid) in infertile women with PCOS than in women without PCOS. The mean scores for eight clinical disorders (somatoform, manic disorder, dysthymia, alcohol-dependence, drug-dependence, post-trauma stress disorder, major depression, and delusion disorder) were also higher in infertile women with PCOS than in women without PCOS. Conclusion(s): The scores of many mental and personality disorders are higher in infertile women with PCOS than in women without PCOS. Thus, clinicians should prioritize recognizing and treating psychological problems of infertile women with PCOS.Copyright Â© 2020 Ahmadi M et al. Licensee African Health Sciences.

N2  - Study Objective: To investigate adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in terms of body perception, self-esteem, and comorbid psychiatric diseases by comparing them with their healthy peers. Design(s): Cross-sectional design. Setting(s): The Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the Department of Pediatric Endocrinology outpatient clinic of Cumhuriyet University in Sivas, Turkey. Participant(s): Fifty female adolescents aged 12-18 years who were diagnosed as having PCOS and 37 healthy adolescents aged 12-18 years. Interventions and Main Outcome Measure(s): All adolescents were evaluated by a child and adolescent psychiatrist using a semistructured interview (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children) and asked to complete the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Children's Depression Inventory, and Body Image Scale. Result(s): The rate of psychiatric disorders in the PCOS group was significantly higher than in the control participants (16/50 (32%) vs 5/37 (13.5%), respectively; P =.046). The most common disorder was major depressive disorder. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and Body Image Scale scores of the PCOS group were lower (P =.03; P <.001, respectively), and Children's Depression Inventory scores were higher (P =.03) than in the control group. There was no significant relationship between obesity, hirsutism, and insulin resistance with any psychiatric disorders in the PCOS group. Conclusion(s): Adolescents with PCOS had more psychopathology than their peers. Moreover, their self-esteem was lower and their body perceptions were more dissatisfied compared with their peers.Copyright Â© 2020 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common ovary disorder characterize by complex of health problems that affects women of reproductive age due to hormonal imbalance and metabolic problems, so nurses have an important role in providing counseling and health education for women in reproductive age. Objective(s): To assess nurses knowledge about Polycystic ovary syndrome. Methodology: A descriptive study was conducted on probability sample (systematic random) of (100) nurses and midwife who work in obstetric and gynecological departments from three hospitals at Baghdad City: AL-Karkh maternity Hospital, Al-Elwia Maternity Teaching Hospital and Baghdad Teaching Hospital. Study implemented for the period of February 24th 2015 to April 25th 2015. A questionnaire was used as a tool of data collection to fulfill with objective of the study and consisted of three parts, including demographic characteristics, personal experience with polycystic ovary syndrome, sources of knowledge regarding polycystic ovary syndrome and knowledge regarding polycystic ovary syndrome. A pilot study was carried out to test the reliability of the questionnaire and content validity was carried out through the 17 experts. Descriptive statistical analyses were used to analyze the data. Result(s): In general the results of the study revealed that half of nurses were at age group (30-39) years, (35%) of study sample was Institute of medical technology/nursing, half of study sample work at obstetric and gynecological ward, (55%) of study sample were married and the highest percentage (93%) their sources of knowledge about Polycystic ovary syndrome from syllabus. Most of the study sample had high assessment level of knowledge about polycystic ovary syndrome. Conclusion(s): Nurses had high level of knowledge regarding the polycystic ovary syndrome, the reason for this is due to nursing curriculum was effective in giving scientific knowledge about it.Copyright Â© 2020, Institute of Medico-Legal Publications.

N2  - Aims: The knowledge, awareness, and practice with regards to the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) among doctors from India is not currently known. This study aimed to determine current clinical practice with regards to managing PCOS. Method(s): Local doctors from New Delhi attending an international-led endocrinology conference in New Delhi (the Society for the Promotion of Education in Endocrinology and Diabetes [SPEED] Annual Conference, February 2019) were evaluated regarding their PCOS treatment preferences using a standardized questionnaire, consisting of 30 multiple-choice questions.The questionnaire evaluated doctors' knowledge of clinical symptomatology; biochemical, hormonal, and radiologic evaluation; and pharmacotherapy practices for PCOS. Result(s): A total of 695 questionnaires were distributed and 538 were collected back, 417 of which had >80% of the questions answered and were analyzed (63.31% of participants were general physicians, 10.31% were gynecologists, 10.55% were pediatricians, 6.95% were endocrinologists, and 8.87% had other specialties). The mean age of the doctors was 43.07 +/- 13.28 years. The use of screening for non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia by measuring serum 17-OH-progestrone in people living with PCOS is rare in India. Endocrinologists and gynecologists are more likely to use hormone pills to manage PCOS. Both oral contraceptive pills and progestogen-only pills are commonly used in PCOS. Spironolactone is the most commonly used anti-androgen; use of other anti-androgens is low. Metabolic complications of PCOS (dysglycemia and dyslipidemia) are more likely to be screened by endocrinologists and general physicians. Depression in PCOS was more likely to be detected by pediatricians. Conclusion(s): There is heterogeneity in PCOS treatment practices among doctors of different specialties, warranting better coordination among gynecologists, endocrinologists, pediatricians, and general physicians to homogenize and standardize treatment practices.Copyright Â© Touch Medical Media 2020

N2  - Background: Patients with hirsutism have an increased number of psychological diseases including depression, anxiety, and social isolation with decreased quality of life. Aim(s): We aimed to investigate changes in the quality of life of patients with hirsutism among Turkish women. Method(s): A total of 57 patients diagnosed with hirsutism were included in this study. The patients were investigated in terms of Dermatological Life Quality Index (DLQI) score, concomitant clinical findings, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) was used for the diagnosis of hirsutism. Result(s): The mean DLQI score of the patients was 9.80 +/- 6.50, while the median value of the mFG score was 25 (minimum 8, maximum 34). The mean DLQI score of patients who had an mFG score of four only in one region of the face was statistically higher than women with an mFG score less than four (P =.033). No statistically significant correlation was found between DLQI and mFG scores (P =.254). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of DLQI between women with acne, seborrhea, androgenetic alopecia, menstrual irregularity, or acanthosis nigricans versus those without them (P >.05). The mean DLQI score was statistically significantly higher for patients with PCOS than for those without PCOS (P =.004). Conclusion(s): As shown by mFG score, quality of life is affected in certain areas for women with hirsutism. The mFG score is not correlated with the quality of life score. Certain areas of excessive hair that lead to stigma may be more important in quality of life for these women. The quality of life seems to be significantly more affected in hirsutism patients with PCOS than those without PCOS. Finally, clinical symptoms and signs appear to have no important role in the quality of life of patients with hirsutism.Copyright Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, LLC

N2  - AIM: To explore the perceived biopsychosocial and medical experiences of women with polycystic ovary syndrome, as presented in stories written by women on a social support website. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive using low inference content analysis, guided by the social construction of illness theoretical framework. METHOD(S): In July 2018, 95 of 379 website stories were randomly selected. The stories were analysed, ending in September 2018. RESULT(S): Three major themes aligning with framework constructs were identified: Biopsychosocial struggles and management: "I can't even look in the mirror without wanting to cry," Sociocultural navigation: "I feel all alone and no one understands me." and Healthcare encounters: "I don't feel like I'm getting the help I need". These themes revealed that Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has biological and experiential components, which exist independently of each other and hold social and cultural meanings. CONCLUSION(S): Care for women with PCOS should be multidisciplinary, multidimensional, and multi-level to ameliorate biopsychosocial issues. Provider (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) education about PCOS is necessary to enhance timely diagnosis and implement individualized treatment strategies. Non-advanced practice nurses are in a unique position to have an impact on patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes by providing and reinforcing patient education, coordinating management processes, counselling via telephone or in-person appointments and facilitating referrals to ancillary providers. Evidence-based and accessible psychosocial supports and interventions will lead to improved self-esteem and effective coping skills, and reduced stigma-related stress. Lastly, policy changes are warranted to address access to care, health insurance inequities and inadequate funding for PCOS-related research. IMPACT: Increased awareness of PCOS and its biopsychosocial aspects will aid providers with timely diagnosis and meaningful treatment plans. Women with PCOS will gain acknowledgment, acceptance, and insight towards health care and self-management.Copyright Â© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive and metabolic disorder in women; however, many clinicians may not be well versed in scientific advances that aid understanding of the associated reproductive, metabolic, and psychological abnormalities. Women with PCOS are dissatisfied with health care providers, the diagnostic process, and the initial treatment of PCOS and seek information through alternative sources. This has affected the patient-physician relationship by allowing medical information acquired through the internet, whether correct or not, to become accessible to patients and reshape their health care perspective. Patient dissatisfaction with health care providers regarding PCOS raises questions about the responsibilities of academic institutions to adequately train and maintain the competence of clinicians and government agencies to sufficiently support scientific investigation in this field. OBJECTIVE(S): The primary aim was to examine internet searching behaviors of the public regarding PCOS vs another highly prevalent gynecologic disorder. The secondary aim was to explore satisfaction with health care among patients with PCOS and their internet use. The tertiary aim was to examine medical education in reproductive endocrinology and infertility (REI) during obstetrics and gynecology (Ob/Gyn) residency as a proxy for physician knowledge in this field. METHOD(S): Google search trends and StoryBase quantified monthly Google absolute search volumes for search terms related to PCOS and fibroids (January 2004 to December 2017; United States). The reproductive disorder, fibroids, was selected as a comparison group because of its high prevalence among women. Between female groups, monthly absolute search volumes and their trends were compared. A Web-based questionnaire (June 2015 to March 2018) explored health care experiences and the internet use of women with PCOS. REI rotation information during Ob/Gyn residency in the United States was obtained from the Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics website. RESULT(S): For PCOS (R=0.89; P<.01), but not fibroids (R=0.09; P=.25), monthly absolute search volumes increased significantly. PCOS-related monthly absolute search volumes (mean 384,423 searches, SD 88,756) were significantly greater than fibroid-related monthly absolute search volumes (mean 348,502 searches, SD 37,317; P<.05). PCOS was diagnosed by an Ob/Gyn in 60.9% (462/759) of patients, and 57.3% (435/759) of patients were dissatisfied with overall care. Among patients with PCOS, 98.2% (716/729) searched for PCOS on the Web but only 18.8% (143/729) of patients joined an online PCOS support group or forum. On average, Ob/Gyn residencies dedicated only 4% (2/43) of total block time to REI, whereas 5.5% (11/200) of such residencies did not offer any REI rotations. CONCLUSION(S): Over time, PCOS has been increasingly searched on the Web compared with another highly prevalent gynecologic disorder. Patients with PCOS are dissatisfied with their health care providers, who would benefit from an improved understanding of PCOS during Ob/Gyn residency training.Copyright Â©Luis R Hoyos, Manesha Putra, Abigail A Armstrong, Connie Y Cheng, Carrie K Riestenberg, Tery A Schooler, Daniel A Dumesic.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been associated with developing mental disorders in Western populations, but this association is poorly studied in Asians. Hence, using insurance claims data, this study evaluated the anxiety risk in women with PCOS. Method(s): Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 7026 women aged 15-49 years with newly diagnosed PCOS without anxiety in 1998-2013 as the PCOS cohort. We also randomly selected 28,104 women without PCOS and anxiety as the comparison cohort, which was frequency-matched to cases by age and index year. Determined by incidence and Cox method, the hazard ratio (HR) of anxiety and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association with PCOS were estimated after a 16-year follow-up. Result(s): The incidence of anxiety was 19.5% higher in the PCOS cohort than in the comparison cohort (15.3 vs. 12.8 per 1000 person-years), with an adjusted HR of 1.18 (95% CI=1.07-1.30). For women with both PCOS and comorbid depression, it was 32.1 per 1000 person-years, with an adjusted HR of 2.24 (95% CI=1.24-4.06), compared with those without PCOS or depression. Moreover, it was 48.0 per 1000 person-years for women with depression alone (adjusted HR=3.46; 95% CI=2.58-4.64). Limitation(s): We used a diagnostic code to identify PCOS cases without reference to pathology records. Miscoding might have occurred in the database. Conclusion(s): PCOS is associated with an increased risk of developing anxiety independently. Comorbid depression could increase the risk further. Our findings provide vital information for Asian women to cope with anxiety.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common female reproductive disorder with multiple manifestations. There are relatively few qualitative studies exploring the nature of living with PCOS despite its high prevalence. Qualitative research can enhance clinical practice via the provision of patient insights into the experience of living with their condition. Method(s): We conducted two focus groups and three semi-structured interviews of Australian overweight/obese women with PCOS aged 18-46 years between March and April 2017 who were recruited through social media advertising. Interviews and focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was applied to the data, using the method of constant comparison. Result(s): Ten women contributed data from two focus groups and two semi-structured interviews. Five themes emerged from the data: complexity of the condition with its multiple manifestations, difficulties with delayed diagnosis and lack of information provided after diagnosis, negative experiences on social media and online forums and the need for support, frustration over lack of a "cure"; and the impact of symptoms and concern about long-term sequelae. Conclusion(s): Living with PCOS appears to generate a significant degree of anxiety about the future, dissatisfaction with current treatment models, and loss of feminine identity. Gaps in timely diagnosis, information and support provision need to be addressed. This includes supporting weight management as a fundamental concern for women with PCOS.Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL), but longitudinal data beyond the reproductive years are lacking, and the impact of isolated PCOS symptoms is unclear. Objective(s): To study generic HRQoL using the 15D questionnaire, life satisfaction, and self-reported health status in women with PCOS symptoms at ages 31 and 46 years. Design(s): A longitudinal assessment using the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. Setting(s): General community. Participant(s): The 15D data were available for women reporting isolated oligo-amenorrhea (OA; at age 31 years, 214; and 46 years, 211), isolated hirsutism (H; 31 years, 211; and 46 years, 216), OA + H (PCOS; 31 years, 74; and 46 years, 75), or no PCOS symptoms (controls; 31 years, 1382; and 46 years, 1412). Data for life satisfaction and current health status were available for OA (31 years, 329; and 46 years, 247), H (31 years, 323; and 46 years, 238), PCOS (31 years, 125; and 46 years, 86), control (31 years, 2182; and 46 years, 1613) groups. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): 15D HRQoL, questionnaires on life satisfaction, and self-reported health status. Result(s): HRQoL was lower at ages 31 and 46 in women with PCOS or H than in the controls. PCOS was an independent risk factor for low HRQoL, and the decrease in HRQoL in PCOS was similar to that of women with other chronic conditions, such as asthma, migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, and depression. The risk for low HRQoL in PCOS remained significant after adjusting for body mass index, hyperandrogenism, and socioeconomic status. Mental distress was the strongest contributing factor to HRQoL. PCOS was also associated with a risk for low life satisfaction and a 4-fold risk for reporting a poor health status. Conclusions. Women with PCOS present with low HRQoL, decreased life satisfaction, and a poorer self-reported health status up to their late reproductive years. Assessments and interventions aiming to improve HRQoL in PCOS should be targeted beyond the fertile age.Copyright Â© 2020 Endocrine Society. All rights reserved.

N2  - Numerous studies have been carried out on depression and sexual dysfunction concomitant with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Increasing evidence has revealed the importance of inflammation in the etiology of PCOS. In addition, it has been known that some neuromodulators affect depression and sexual function. However, their effects on PCOS are not known. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of depression and sexual function with cytokines and neuromodulators in PCOS patients. The present study included 20 fertile and 30 infertile patients diagnosed with PCOS and 30 healthy volunteers. Metabolic and endocrine parameters, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, TNFalpha, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), Glutamate, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serum levels, Beck Depression Index (BDI) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) scores of the patients were compared between the groups. TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, glutamate, GABA, and BDI scores were found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the PCOS group (p < 0.05). Glutamate, TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 values were higher whereas GABA and BDNF values were lower in pateints with moderate and severe depression (p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant relationships between these parameters and the FSFI scores (p > 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted with potential factors that may affect sexual dysfunction. The results indicated that high waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (> 0.80) with an odds ratio of 1.81 in PCOS patients, and body mass index (BMI) with an odds ratio of 2.3 and high WHR (> 0.80) with an odds ratio of 1.97 in all patients were found to be independent risk factors affecting sexual dysfunction. The results of the present study suggested that chronic low-dose inflammation seen in PCOS may interact with some neuromodulators, leading to the development of depression. However, no relationship was found between these parameters and sexual function.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Objectives: To highlight the self-reported experiences and disease perceptions of infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): A qualitative study using an inductive method was conducted on infertile women with PCOS who shared their self-reported experiences on French-speaking on-line forums. Result(s): 785 comments by 211 women on 7 forums were analyzed. Women complained of late diagnosis and lack of information regarding PCOS. PCOS and infertility showed negative psychological impact on daily life. This impact appeared to be alleviated by the sharing of knowledge and experience enabled by these forums. Conclusion(s): The self-reported experience of infertile women with PCOS is interesting for health practitioners. The psychological impact of PCOS and perceptions of illness appear to be improved by sharing experiences between women with PCOS, suggesting a beneficial support role of online discussion forums.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS

N2  - Quality of life (QoL) is an important aspect of health and well-being. QoL is reduced in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but there is limited data in adolescents. This review aimed to assess studies regarding the QoL of adolescent girls with PCOS. Five databases were searched for relevant studies. Studies were included if they were conducted in adolescent girls with PCOS, aged 12-22 years old, and used a questionnaire to measure QoL. The search identified a total of 254 studies, and after exclusions, 11 relevant studies were included in the review. Most studies had a relatively small sample size, but overall included a total of 512 adolescents with PCOS. In most cases, adolescent girls with PCOS have reduced QoL when compared to healthy girls, and PCOS symptoms/excess weight impact on their QoL. Further research is required due to limited data on QoL in adolescents with PCOS of normal weight.Copyright Â© 2020 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a chronic condition with symptoms affecting many women at reproductive age and evaluating their health-related quality of Life (HRQoL) is an important issue. Moreover, differences in the HRQoL between women with different PCOS phenotypes have never been analyzed. Therefore, the aim of our study was to compare the HRQoL between women with PCOS -and its phenotypes- and controls attending to a tertiary hospital. Method(s): A group of 117 women with PCOS and 153 controls were studied between 2014 and 2016. Controls were women without PCOS attending the gynecological outpatient clinic for routine examinations. Cases were women attending the same setting and diagnosed with PCOS. PCOS diagnose was performed following the Rotterdam Criteria and women were further classified by anovulatory or ovulatory phenotypic subtype. Women underwent physical and gynecological exams and completed health questionnaires including the Short Form-12v2. Eight scales and two component summary scores [Physical (PCS) and Mental (MCS), respectively] were calculated. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess differences in HRQoL between women with PCOS and controls. Result(s): All women with PCOS and anovulatory PCOS presented lower score in PCS compared to controls [mean (95%CI): 53.7 (52.5-54.9) and 52.9 (51.5-54.4) vs. 55.8 (54.8-56.8); p-values< 0.01], as well as lower scores for five out of the eight scales (p-values < 0.05) after adjusting by age, body mass index, infertility, educational level and current occupation. No significant differences were observed for the MCS between women with or without PCOS or its phenotypic subtypes. Conclusion(s): HRQoL was significantly decreased in adult women with PCOS and its anovulatory phenotype compared to controls attending the outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital. These results may have implications for the clinical practice and suggest the need for specific interventions in women with PCOS.Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: The objectives of this study were to compare the prevalence and quality of life (QOL) of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared with healthy women. Method(s): This was a case-control study of 201 women recruited at an infertility clinic in Iran. The control group were healthy women (n = 100) and the comparison group, women with PCOS (n = 101). Data were collected by clinical Rome III criteria to determine the IBS, Bristol scale for stool consistency and IBS QOL. Result(s): The reporting of IBS symptoms were higher in PCOS (20.7%) than control group (11%) (P = 0.05). The IBS QOL score in the IBS + PCOS group was lower than other groups (IBS+ non PCOS, non IBS + PCOS, non IBS+ non PCOS; scores in food avoidance and worries about health domains were significant (P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): We conclude that having PCOS and an increased level of LH/FSH tends to cause IBS symptoms. IBS + PCOS women experience significant impaired quality of life scores particularly in relation to worries about health and food avoidance. These results offer further insights into IBS in PCOS women and their functional status and wellbeing.Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Objectives: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive/metabolic condition associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and depression in adult women. Depression in adults is related to PCOS dermatologic manifestations. Adolescents with obesity with or without T2D have elevated depression symptoms, but data from youth with PCOS and obesity with/without T2D are limited. Method(s): Our study included girls, aged 11 to 17 years, with obesity and PCOS, PCOS+T2D or T2D, who were newly seen in an obesity complications clinic after March 2016. All participants had Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D, 20 items) scores obtained within 6 months of PCOS or T2D diagnosis. Data on history of psychiatric diagnosis and treatment, metabolic syndrome and severity of acne and hirsutism were collected through chart review. Result(s): One hundred five girls (47 with PCOS, 14 with PCOS+T2D, 44 with T2D) had similar age (15+/-1.8 years) and body mass index z scores (2.2+/-0.4). CES-D scores >=16, indicating elevated depression symptoms, and CES-D scores >=24, indicating severe depression symptoms, were observed in 60% and 30% of girls with PCOS, 78% and 71% of those with PCOS+T2D and 39% and 21% of those with T2D, respectively (p<0.0001 for both cutpoints). A higher CES-D score was not associated with severity of hirsutism or acne (p>0.05 for both). Conclusion(s): Adolescents with PCOS and obesity have higher rates of elevated depression symptoms compared with girls with T2D, which is not related to worse dermatologic symptoms. Because depression may impact both PCOS and T2D management and adherence to therapy, greater efforts should be made to screen for and address mental health in adolescents with PCOS and obesity, especially if T2D is present.Copyright Â© 2020 Canadian Diabetes Association

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive-aged women. A recent study found that many obstetrics and gynecology (ObGyn) practicing physicians are unaware of the Rotterdam criteria recommended for diagnosis. Our objective was to identify gaps in trainee knowledge of PCOS diagnostic criteria and management. An online survey was sent out to US ObGyn physicians-in-training in 2018. The primary outcomes were identification of at least one component of each Rotterdam criteria (Rot-3): (1) oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, (2) clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and (3) ovarian volume or antral follicle count, and identification of all five components (Rot-5). Secondary outcomes were identification of comorbidities and management of PCOS. Multivariable logistic regression was used controlling for gender, seniority (PGY) status, program type, completion of an REI rotation, and number of PCOS patients seen. 85.4% of 347 trainees completing the survey reported using Rotterdam criteria to diagnose PCOS. However, only 55% identified Rot-3 and less than 10% identified Rot-5. Seniority (PGY4 OR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.2-4.1; p =.01) and completion of REI rotation (OR 1.8 95% CI: 1.2, 1.8; p =.006) were associated with identifying Rot-3. Similar findings were noted with identifying Rot-5. Our study identified significant gaps in knowledge regarding PCOS, suggesting an urgent need for improving strategies for trainee education to increase patient satisfaction and provide comprehensive care.Copyright Â© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Background: To date, some factors associated with quality of sleep in patients with PCOS have been identified. Previous studies have mainly focused on limited psychological variables related to sleep disorder without evaluating them in a comprehensive framework. Objective(s): The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of predictive factors on the sleep quality of PCOS patients using structural equation modeling (SEM). Material(s) and Method(s): The present study is a case control that is done in an infertility clinic in Hormozgan, Iran. The case group (n = 201) consisted of women with PCOS and the control group (n = 199) was healthy women whose partners had male infertility. All the women recruited to the study completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Body Image Concern Investigation, the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index on attendance at the Hormozgan Infertility Clinic. Direct and indirect relationship between clinical signs, psychological situation, self-esteem, and body image was studied as independent predictors of sleep quality using structural equation modeling. Result(s): Compared with the control group, there was a lower sleep quality in women with PCOS in all fields, especially subjective sleep quality (P < 0.05), daytime function (P = 0.001), and use of sleep medication (P = 0.003). The strongest effect from a psychological variable on sleep quality was body image which had negative impact on sleep quality of patients with PCOS. Conclusion(s): Our study showed that body image plays an important role in the sleep quality of women with PCOS.Copyright Â© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - Background: The universally adopted 2018 PCOS medical diagnostic and treatment guidelines for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) cites the need for a brief screening measure that can be easily administered in the clinical care setting. We evaluate a 12-item questionnaire emphasizing the medical symptoms of PCOS with a group of women with PCOS as well as comparison samples of college women not diagnosed with PCOS. Method(s): Of 120 undergraduate psychology women 18 to 41 years of age, 86 screened negative on a 12-item PCOS symptoms inventory. They were compared to a group of PCOS patients diagnosed medically in a manner consistent with the Teede et al. (2018) evidence-based diagnostic guidelines. The screen-positive, screen-negative, and PCOS-confirmed groups were compared on the PCOS Quality-of-Life (QoL) questionnaire, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZDS), Spielberg State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), Spiritual well-being and Spiritual Beliefs Inventories, the computerized Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric (ANAM) battery, and an experimental tachistoscopic Bilateral Perceptual Asymmetries Letter and Dots Matching Bilateral Field Advantage (BFA) test (to evaluate the effects of early brain androgenization possible from PCOS). For each questionnaire and neuropsychological performance principal outcome, the Linear Mixed Effects (LME) model was employed to evaluate the predictive significance of demographic characteristics and group membership (confirmed cases, screen negative and screen positive cases) for these outcomes. Result(s): The PCOS-confirmed women scored more poorly than the screen-negative (reference) and screen-positive groups on all the measures of physical, emotional, social, and spiritual well-being measures. On the ANAM neuropsychological battery, PCOS-confirmed women did more poorly on Sternberg Memory and Stimulus Response throughput measures. They also had slower correct response speed for both the unilateral and bilateral dot- and letter-matching tachistoscopic stimulus presentations. However, the bilateral field advantage throughput performance ratio did not differ among groups, which is a global measure of bilateral versus unilateral brain/behavior asymmetries. Conclusion(s): PCOS screening can be a feasible and important part of women's healthcare. PCOS-confirmed women should receive not only the medical standard of care from the 2018 guidelines, but also comprehensive psychosocial and neurocognitive support to enhance their quality of life.Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: What are clinicians' views about the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and how do they handle any complexities and uncertainties in practice? SUMMARY ANSWER: Clinicians have to navigate many areas of complexity and uncertainty regarding the diagnosis of PCOS, related to the diagnostic criteria, limitations in current evidence and misconceptions surrounding diagnosis, and expressed concern about the risk and consequences of both under-and overdiagnosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: PCOS is a complex, heterogeneous condition with many areas of uncertainty, raising concerns about both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis. Quantitative studies with clinicians have found considerable variation in diagnostic criteria used and care provided, as well as a lack of awareness around the breadth of PCOS features and poor uptake of recommended screening for metabolic complications. Clinicians' views about the uncertainties and complexities of diagnosing PCOS have not been explored. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with clinicians from September 2017 to July 2018 to explore their perceptions about the diagnosis of PCOS, including how they handle any complexities and uncertainties in practice. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A group of 36 clinicians (15 general practitioners, 10 gynaecologists and 11 endocrinologists) currently practicing in Australia, were recruited through advertising via professional organisations, contacting a random sample of endocrine and gynaecology teams across Australia and snowballing. Transcribed audio-recordings were analysed thematically using Framework analysis. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Clinicians expressed a range of uncertainties and complexities regarding the diagnosis of PCOS, which were organised into three areas: (i) establishing diagnosis (e.g. lack of standardisation regarding diagnostic cut-offs, risk of misdiagnosis), (ii) factors influencing the diagnostic process (e.g. awareness of limitations in evidence and consideration of the benefits and harms) and (iii) strategies for handling challenges and uncertainties (e.g. using caution and communication of uncertainties). Clinicians also varied in their concerns regarding under-and overdiagnosis. Overall, most felt the diagnosis was beneficial for women provided that it was the correct diagnosis and time was taken to assess patient expectations and dispel misconceptions, particularly concerning fertility. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: There is possible selection bias, as clinicians who are more knowledgeable about PCOS may have been more likely to participate. Clinicians' views may also differ in other countries. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings underscore the vital need to first consider PCOS a diagnosis of exclusion and use caution before giving a diagnosis in order to reduce misdiagnosis, as suggested by clinicians in our study. Until there is greater standardisation of diagnostic criteria, more transparent conversations with women may help them understand the uncertainties surrounding the criteria and limitations in the evidence. Additionally, clinicians emphasised the importance of education and reassurance to minimise the potential harmful impact of the diagnosis and improve patient-centred outcomes. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was funded by the University of Sydney Lifespan Research Network and an NHMRC Program Grant (APP1113532). T.C. is supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship and a Sydney Medical School Foundation Scholarship, from the The University of Sydney, Australia.

T1  - Risk of psychological burden in polycystic ovary syndrome: A case control study in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
A1  - Asdaq S.M.B.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Background: While increased risk of psychiatric burden in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is reported in the literature, there is dearth of reports from Saudi Arabia on occurrence of psychological burden in women with PCOS. This study aimed to compare the sociodemographic and clinical features of PCOS cases with non-PCOS control and explore the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress in PCOS and non-PCOS women. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a case-control study carried out in PSMMC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from March 2019 to June 2019. Samples were recruited by convenience sampling and simple random method in PCOS cases (82) and control group (85), respectively. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to measure the presence of psychological burden. Result(s): High percentage of participants were in an age group of 26-35 years (51%) and university educated (64%). Significantly (P = 0.001) high proportion of PCOS cases found with irregular menses, hirsutism, infertility and presence of acne (P = 0.001) when compared to control group. The odds of developing depression (P = 0.006), anxiety (P = 0.028) and stress (P = 0.000) was significantly higher in PCOS cases compared to control participants. Further, among the three parameters, the occurrence of stress (odds ratio, OR=10.45) in women with PCOS was more common than depression (OR=2.675) and anxiety (OR=2.056). Limitation(s): Recall bias and inclusion of only one hospital. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, most of the PCOS cases had stress, depression and anxiety compared to control group. Meeting the psychological need of the PCOS women will help in improving their quality of life.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common lifelong metabolic condition with serious associated comorbidities. Evidence points to a delay in diagnosis and inconsistency in the information provided to women with PCOS. Aim(s): To capture women's experiences of how PCOS is diagnosed and managed in UK general practice. Design and setting: This was a mixed-methods study with an online questionnaire survey and semi-structured telephone interviews with a subset of responders. Method(s): An online survey to elicit women's experiences of general practice PCOS care was promoted by charities and BBC Radio Leicester. The survey was accessible online between January 2018 and November 2018. A subset of responders undertook a semi-structured telephone interview to provide more in-depth data. Result(s): A total of 323 women completed the survey (average age 35.4 years) and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 women. There were five key themes identified through the survey responses. Participants described a variable lag time from presentation to PCOS diagnosis, with a median of 6-12 months. Many had experienced mental health problems associated with their PCOS symptoms, but had not discussed these with the GP. Many were unable to recall any discussion about associated comorbidities with the GP. Some differences were identified between the experiences of women from white British backgrounds and those from other ethnic backgrounds. Conclusion(s): From the experiences of the women in this study, it appears that PCOS in general practice is not viewed as a long-term condition with an increased risk of comorbidities including mental health problems. Further research should explore GPs' awareness of comorbidities and the differences in PCOS care experienced by women from different ethnic backgrounds.Copyright Â© 2020 British Journal of General Practice.

N2  - Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are at increased risk of psychological distress including anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, less is known about sexual satisfaction and self-esteem as well as the relationship of these aspects of psychological function with clinical and hormonal profiles associated with PCOS. This cross-sectional study compared women with PCOS (N = 96) and healthy controls (N = 47). This study assessed sexual function (primary outcome), self-esteem, anxiety, and depression as well as evaluation of clinical, endocrine, and metabolic parameters. Overall, sexual satisfaction scores were comparable among women with and without PCOS. However, psychosexual function of women with PCOS exhibited distinguishing characteristics. The unconscious aspect of sexuality: frequency of erotic dreams, significantly correlated with free testosterone (rho = 0.24, P = 0.03) and DHEAS (rho = 0.31, P = 0.004) only in the PCOS group. In contrast, in women with PCOS, the frequency of masturbation did not correlate with endocrine profiles, but correlated with trait anxiety (rho = 0.21, P = 0.049) and depression (rho = 0.21, P = 0.05). Only one aspect of self-esteem (body appearance) was reduced in the PCOS group (P = 0.02) and was related to BMI and androgen. Women with PCOS had greater state anxiety (P = 0.02) and depression (P < 0.001); these scores correlated with BMI. However, anxiety and depression correlated with testosterone only in women without PCOS. The above findings indicate that PCOS is associated with a broad range of alterations of psychological function including psychosexual aspects; these alterations are in complex relationship with BMI and androgen levels.Copyright Â© 2019, Society for Reproductive Investigation.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of the study was to identify differences in the level of anxiety, stress coping ways, personality traits, and social adjustments in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared to those without PCOS. Method(s): In a case-control study, 257 infertile of women were recruited at Fatemeh Azahra Infertility and Reproductive Health Research Center (Babol, Iran) from May 2016 to December 2017. A total of 135 women with PCOS and 122 women without PCOS completed the following questionnaires; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WCQ), NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), and Bell's Adjustment Inventory. Result(s): Infertile women with PCOS had a higher mean score of trait anxiety than those without PCOS (46.19 +/- 5.29 vs 44.49 +/- 5.13, P = 0.004), but no difference was observed for state anxiety. The two groups did not have any significant differences in the mean scores of social adjustment and ways of coping, except for social support and problem-focused coping which were higher in the PCOS group. The PCOS personality traits of PCOS infertile women were not different regarding neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness. The only exception was that infertile PCOS women had a significantly higher mean score of openness to experience than those without PCOS (P = 0.049). Conclusion(s): Clinicians could take advantage of the psychological differences of infertile women with PCOS and without PCOS for better management of PCOS in infertility settings; despite higher levels of anxiety they are more likely to cope with stress and are welcome to new experiences.Copyright Â© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy among women of reproductive age. PCOS is a polysimptomatic disease, the leading manifestations of which are hyperandrogenic dermopathy, menstrual dysfunction, infertility and obesity. Dissatisfaction with one's own appearance, low self-esteem, a feeling of sexual unattractiveness cause chronic psychological discomfort, mood disturbances and problems in the relationship with a partner. The article presents an overview of scientific sources on the effect of polycystic ovary syndrome on the quality of life and the sexual function of women. Data recorded confirm the hypothesis that PCOS is not only an endocrine disorder, but a heterogeneous condition with reproductive, metabolic, and mental manifestations. The association of PCOS manifestations with a decrease in the quality of life and disorders in the sexual sphere of women was well assessed. Data presented in the review ensure the absolute medical and social importance of the study of PCOS.Copyright Â© 2019, Â© 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Psychological co-morbidities common in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may contribute to disordered eating and subsequent weight gain. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence of disordered eating and a range of eating disorders and demographic risk factors associated with these behaviours within an Australian group of women with and without PCOS. Data from 899 women with (n = 501) and without (n = 398) PCOS were analysed as possibly indicative of disordered eating or eating disorders using the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria. Disordered eating (p = 0.012) but not eating disorders (p = 0.076) were more prevalent in women with PCOS compared to controls. Increased body mass index (BMI) [Odds Ratio (OR): 1.03; 95%; Confidence Interval (CI): 1.01, 1.05, p = 0.012] and older age [OR: 1.05; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.08, p = 0.002] but not PCOS diagnosis [OR: 1.43; 95%CI: 0.96, 2.13 p = 0.078] increased the odds of disordered eating. Increased BMI [OR: 1.04; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.06, p < 0.001] and younger age [OR:-0.95; 95%CI: 0.93-0.95, p < 0.001] but not PCOS diagnosis [OR: 1.38; 95%CI: 0.97, 1.95, p = 0.076] increased the odds of an eating disorder. Clinicians are recommended to screen all women with PCOS for possible disordered eating behaviours, with particular attention to women with elevated BMI.Copyright Â© 2019 by the authors.

N2  - Objective To date, little is known about differences in the knowledge, diagnosis making and treatment strategies of health care providers regarding polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) across different disciplines in countries with similar health care systems. To inform guideline translation, we aimed to study physician reported awareness, diagnosis and management of PCOS and to explore differences between medical disciplines in the Nordic countries and Estonia. Methods This cross-sectional survey was conducted among 382 endocrinologists and obstetrician-gynaecologists in the Nordic countries and Estonia in 2015-2016. Of the participating physicians, 43% resided in Finland, 18% in Denmark, 16% in Norway, 13% in Estonia, and 10% in Sweden or Iceland, and 75% were obstetrician-gynaecologists. Multivariable logistic regression models were run to identify health care provider characteristics for awareness, diagnosis and treatment of PCOS. Results Clinical features, lifestyle management and comorbidity were commonly recognized in women with PCOS, while impairment in psychosocial wellbeing was not well acknowledged. Over two-thirds of the physicians used the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for PCOS. Medical endocrinologists more often recommended lifestyle management (OR = 3.6, CI 1.6-8.1) or metformin (OR = 5.0, CI 2.5-10.2), but less frequently OCP (OR = 0.5, CI 0.2-0.9) for nonfertility concerns than general obstetrician-gynaecologists. The physicians aged <35 years were 2.2 times (95% CI 1.1-4.3) more likely than older physicians to recommend lifestyle management for patients with PCOS for fertility concerns. Physicians aged 46-55 years were less likely to recommend oral contraceptive pills (OCP) for patients with PCOS than physicians aged >56 (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8). Conclusion Despite well-organized healthcare, awareness, diagnosis and management of PCOS is suboptimal, especially in relation to psychosocial comorbidities, among physicians in the Nordic countries and Estonia. Physicians need more education on PCOS and evidence-based information on Rotterdam diagnostic criteria, psychosocial features and treatment of PCOS, with the recently published international PCOS guideline well needed and welcomed.Copyright: Â© 2019 Piltonen et al.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we aimed to compare temperament and character traits between patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and age-body mass index-matched healthy controls (HC). We hypothesized that patient with PCOS would differ in terms of temperament and character traits compared with HCs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients who were diagnosed with PCOS and 42 age-body mass index-matched healthy controls (HC) were included in the study. The groups were compared in terms of temperament and character traits and anxiety status with the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-1 and STAI-2). FINDINGS: There was a statistically significant difference between patient and the control group in terms of cooperativeness dimension (t = -2.81; p = 0.006). It was a lower mean in the PCOS group (20.98 +/- 2.992). In addition, scores of STAI-1 and STAI-2 were significantly higher in the PCOS group compared with the HC group (respectively; t = 5.70; p < 0.001; t = 2.12; p = 0.037). The score of cooperativeness and multivariate analysis of variance was found to be significantly lower in the PCOS group. CONCLUSION(S): Patients with PCOS had significant a different character trait such as lower cooperativeness compared with HC. Additionally, we found that this different character dimension would be a trait in PCOS after covariant analysis. We suggest that our result supported the psychiatric background of PCOS.Copyright Â© 2019, Â© 2019 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - This study aimed to analyze the measurement properties of the Health-related quality of life questionnaire for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOSQ-50) in a sample of Serbian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Seventy-six women with PCOS from an endocrinology clinic and 28 healthy women participated between October 2016 and March 2017. The measure was rigorously translated and culturally adapted into Serbian. Psychometric evaluation included descriptive analysis, internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient), test-retest reliability (intraclass-correlation coefficient - ICC) and construct validity testing. Cronbach's alpha coefficient ranged from 0.67 to 0.96 for domain scales of PCOSQ-50 scores, while the ICCs for test-retest reliability for these domains ranged from 0.66 to 0.89. Women with PCOS had significantly lower scores than healthy women for hirsutism, obesity and menstrual disorders and the total PCOSQ-50 scale score (p <= 0.03), but not for the psychosocial and emotional, fertility, sexual function, and coping scales. These results show that the Serbian PCOSQ-50 measure is acceptable and could produce reliable and valid assessments of PCOS-related quality of life for at least four out of seven domains. Considering that validity testing is an iterative process, additional work is needed before the whole measure is used in routine clinical practice.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of eating disorders in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared with women without PCOS and examine the relationship between PCOS, body mass index, self-esteem, and psychological distress scores. Design(s): Cross-sectional, community-based study. Setting(s): Not applicable. Patient(s): A total of 8,467 participants born between 1989 and 1995 in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health with self-reported PCOS status (PCOS n = 875 vs. non-PCOS n = 7,592). Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measures(s): Self-reported eating disorders, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Kessler psychological distress scale. Result(s): Compared with women not reporting PCOS, women reporting PCOS had higher prevalence of eating disorders (11.0% vs. 7.6%), low self-esteem (31.7% vs. 24.2%), and psychological distress (severe psychological distress: 21.0% vs. 13.5%). After adjusting for confounders, women reporting PCOS were more likely to report eating disorders (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.0). Low self-esteem and psychological distress were highly correlated and further increased the odds of eating disorders in women reporting PCOS. Polycystic ovary syndrome was significantly associated with low self-esteem and psychological distress but not after adjusting for confounders. Obesity was associated with low self-esteem (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8) and psychological distress (adjusted OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4) but not eating disorders. Underweight women had increased odds for eating disorders (adjusted OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.8-3.4). Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS are more likely to report low self-esteem, psychological distress, and eating disorders. Low self-esteem and psychological distress are highly correlated and further increased the risk for eating disorders.Copyright Â© 2019

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with reduced quality of life (QoL), though the role of associated obesity is unclear. In this study we examined the effects of six months treatment with liraglutide, 1.8 mg od, on obesity, depression and QoL in young women with PCOS and obesity compared to age- and weight-matched controls. In a cross-sectional study, 36 women were recruited (19 PCOS, 17 controls), age 33.9 +/- 6.7 vs. 33.5 +/- 7.1 yr, and weight 102.1 +/- 17.1 vs. 100.4 +/- 15.1 kg, respectively. PCOS was diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria. Depression was measured using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). QoL was measured using the World Health Organization QoL questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF). At baseline there was no difference in QoL or CES-D scores between the two groups. At six months, weight was reduced by 3.0 +/- 4.2 kg, p =.01, in the PCOS group and 3.8 +/- 3.4 kg, p =.001, in controls. Psychological health improved in the PCOS group (percentage change 11.3%, p <.02). Combining the two groups revealed significant improvement (p <.05) in physical (82.6 +/- 11.2 vs. 78.9 +/- 13.6), psychological (62.4 +/- 16.5 vs. 57.5 +/- 16.4) and social health (76.6 +/- 15.3 vs. 71 +/- 16.8) components of the WHOQOL-BREF at six months. Weight loss is associated with an improvement in QoL; and when matched for age and obesity, PCOS was not independently associated with reduced QoL or depression.Copyright Â© 2019, Â© 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Aim: There is an unclear relationship between Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and psychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression. We aimed to evaluate temperamental and personal characteristics of patients with PCOS. Method(s): Fifty patients with PCOS and 41 healthy controls were included in the study. Hormonal and demographic characteristics were recorded after gynecologic and psychiatric evaluation. Socio-demographical Data Form, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory were performed for all participants. Result(s): Patients with Policystic Ovary Syndrome had significantly higher depression and anxiety scores when compared to the controls (p < 0.05). There were no significant difference in any of the subdimensions neither for temperament nor for character between patient and control groups (p > 0.05). Testosteron levels and the degree of hirsutism, LH/FSH ratio and body mass index of the patients did not have significant correlations with depression or anxiety scores or any of the Cloninger subdimentions (p > 0.05). However, there was a negative correlation between age and novelty seeking and age and reward dependence (r:-0.33, p:0.018; r:-0.295, p:0.037, respectively). Conclusion(s): This preliminary study showed no significant difference between patients and healthy controls regarding temperament and character. Patients had higher anxiety and depression scores. Further research is needed to enlighten this subject.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS

N2  - Aim: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine-metabolic disorder. It affects women's physical well-being and leads to great psychological distress. Indeed, women with PCOS show a compromised quality of life as well as impaired emotional well-being. The aim of this study is to assess personality characteristics, body image and alexithymia in women with PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 59 women with PCOS and 38 healthy controls were administered the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS), the Body Uneasiness Test (BUT) and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2). Result(s): The PCOS group showed higher values of alexithymia and a higher body uneasiness. They also showed higher values on many clinical, content and supplementary scales of the MMPI-2. Discussion(s): It seems that physical appearance and bodily function have a central place in the minds of women with PCOS, as well as in their relationships. However, it is a body they find it hard to feel and with which they mostly feel uncomfortable. Their approach to the outside world seems to be characterized by a certain degree of immaturity, anger, hostility and distrust. Low self-esteem also seems to be connected to a certain tendency toward introversion and withdrawal. This leads to problems in social, professional and intimate relationships.Copyright Â© 2018, Â© 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a lifestyle disorder known to cause profound distress in the physical and emotional well-being of the patient that implicates the need for treatment and lifestyle management. Unawareness and ignorance among patients may be a predominant cause of compromised quality of life (QOL) that necessitates education from health-care professionals. The existing study was designed to assess the impact of counseling on QOL in the above patients. Method(s): This hospital-based interventional study was carried out for 6 months. A total of 173 subjects were recruited for the study. The World Health Organization BREF, a validated, reliable tool to assess QOL was administered in two phases of the study, pre-interventional, and post-interventional phase. Awareness regarding disease and lifestyle modification were detailed by a clinical pharmacist to the patients, and its impact was assessed using suitable statistical techniques. Result(s): The average age of study participants was 23.9+/-4.5 years. Decreased QOL was observed in the women affected with PCOS when compared to healthy controls, wherein the psychological domain was the most affected. Post-intervention, a positive impact was reflected as higher scores in all the 4 QOL domains. Conclusion(s): Women suffering from PCOS exhibit varied symptoms which affect both physical and psychological health. The key factor in management is to create awareness on the complications of the disease and the lifestyle modification to minimize severity and progression. The study findings reveal that women with PCOS showed an improved QOL post participation in awareness programs imparted by the clinical pharmacists.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors.

N2  - Study Objective: To assess psychiatric disorders in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and evaluate health-related quality of life and self-esteem in this group. Design(s): Cross-sectional design. The survey was composed of validated measures and a semistructured interview. Setting(s): University School of Medicine, Turkey. Participant(s): Female adolescents aged 13-18 years. Interventions and Main Outcome Measure(s): Assessment of psychiatric disorders through a semistructured interview (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children) conducted by a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Health-related quality of life was measured using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and self-esteem was measured using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). Result(s): A total of 28 adolescent with PCOS and 31 age- and sex-matched healthy peers were recruited. The psychiatric diagnosis rate was higher in the PCOS group than in the control group (P < .5). In the patient group, 6 of 28 patients (21%) were diagnosed with depressive disorder and the most common single diagnosis was major depressive disorder. There were no significant differences in the PCOS and control groups in terms of RSES and PedsQL scores. There was no significant relationship between RSES scores and body image related to hirsutism, acne, and body mass index. Also, there was no significant relationship between PedsQL scores and hirsutism, acne, and body mass index. Conclusion(s): Adolescents with PCOS frequently experience psychiatric disorders. Physicians should be aware that adolescents with PCOS are at a high risk for major depression and anxiety disorders.Copyright Â© 2019 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology

N2  - Objective: To evaluate differences in body-image distress (BID) scores between women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and controls and whether BID mediates anxiety and depression. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Setting(s): Academic institution. Patient(s): Reproductive-aged women with PCOS (n = 189) and controls (n = 225). Intervention(s): Administering the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations-Appearance Subscale (MBSRQ-AS), Stunkard Figure Rating Scale (FRS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and PCOS quality of life survey (MPCOS-Q). Main Outcome Measure(s): BID, depression, and anxiety scores and mediation of depression and anxiety scores by BID. Result(s): Women with PCOS had worse BID scores on all five MBSRQ-AS subscales adjusted for age, body mass index, race, pregnancy history, income, and employment, and larger differences on the FRS compared with the control women. In multivariable regression models, the prevalence of depressive (28% vs. 19.2%) and anxiety (76.5% vs. 56.5%) symptoms were also statistically significantly higher in women with PCOS compared with the controls. Most MBSRQ-AS subscale scores statistically significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and quality of life scores. The association between PCOS/control status and higher anxiety and depression scores was completely mediated by the appearance evaluation and body areas satisfaction subscales and partially mediated by overweight preoccupation, appearance orientation, and self-classified weight. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS have increased BID and depressive and anxiety symptoms. In our study different aspects of BID either fully or partially mediated the association between PCOS/control status and depression and anxiety scores, suggesting that therapeutic interventions targeted at improving body image may decrease depressive and anxiety symptoms.Copyright Â© 2019 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - To (i) determine whether women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) from a population-based cohort experience elevated depression symptoms and (ii) characterize the trajectory of symptoms over the lifespan. Design(s): The association between PCOS and longitudinal depression scores was investigated among 1127 black and white women participating in Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. PCOS was ascertained at baseline (ages 20 to 32) by U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, incorporating androgens and symptoms of oligomenorrhea and hirsutism. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale was repeated prospectively in 5-year intervals over 25 years. Mixed-effects models evaluated the association between depression scores and PCOS after adjustment for confounders and characterized the trajectory of scores. The impact of race was explored.Copyright Â© 2019 Endocrine Society.

N2  - Background: Infertile females experience some types of distress such as social stress, depression, and sexual dysfunction that may be exacerbated by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The current study aimed at comparing psychological profile of infertile females with PCOS with that of women without PCOS with respect to four domains: infertility stress, depression, sexual dysfunction, and alexithymia. Material(s) and Method(s): The current case-control study was conducted on 240 infertile females (120 with PCOS and 120 without PCOS) in Fatemeh Azahra Infertility and Reproductive Health Research Center (Babol, Iran) from 2016 to 2017. The following questionnaires were used to collect data: the fertility problem inventory (FPI), the female sexual function index (FSFI), the Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-20). Result(s): Females with PCOS had higher FPI total scores than the ones without PCOS (120.68 +/- 29.42 vs. 112.83 +/- 30.94). Of the subscales of infertility stress, the mean scores of social stress and rejection of a future life without a child were higher in females with PCOS than the ones without PCOS (P<0.05). Also, the mean total scores of alexithy-mia symptoms (TAS-20) in females with PCOS were significantly higher than those of the ones without PCOS (59.83 +/- 11.36 vs. 55.69 +/- 11.52). There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the mean scores of depression symptoms and sexual function. Conclusion(s): Infertile females with PCOS experienced higher levels of infertility stress and inability to distinguish and describe their feelings compared with the ones without PCOS. It is suggested that infertility care providers should provide more psychosocial support for infertile females with PCOS.Copyright Â© 2019, Royan Institute (ACECR). All rights reserved.

T1  - Risk of developing depression and its impact on quality of life in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome - A South Indian scenario
A1  - Mukundan A.
A1  - Jayakumari S. 
Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive endocrine disorders, affecting the patient's psychological functioning and satisfaction with life. Settings and Design: Tertiary care hospital based case-control study was conducted. Material(s) and Method(s): the study was effectuated in 372 patients in total, including an equal number of cases and controls.PHQ-9 was used to determine the depression based DSM-IV directly diagnostic criteria for depression and PCOSQS was used to assess the quality of life. Statistical analysis used: Data was examined using descriptive statistics, spearman co-relation, Chi-square test, and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Result(s): The study shows an increased risk of depression in PCOS (76.96% of cases compared to 20.03% of controls), Odd's ratio 5.95 (95% confidence interval [3.818 to 9.351]) and the depression was found to be having an impact on patient's quality of life. Conclusion(s): The care of individuals with PCOS should include the screening and possible treatment for depression in order to achieve and sustain treatment goals considering the fact that Identifying depression early will further improve the quality of life of PCOS patients and also reduce the overall treatment cost, which are generally unaffordable by most individuals with this disease in India.Copyright Â© 2019 Society of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research.

N2  - The purpose of the study was to assess the quality of life (QoL) and satisfaction with life (SwL) of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in comparison with those of healthy controls, and to identify and analyze factors determining QoL and SwL in women with PCOS. The cross-sectional study was performed between January and November 2016 in 504 women using health care services in Poland. The study group comprised women with PCOS, the control group women without PCOS. The study used a diagnostic survey with questionnaires. Research instruments included the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire, the satisfaction with life scale (SWLS), and a standardized interview questionnaire comprising questions on the participants' characteristics. Women with PCOS have lower QoL and SwL than healthy controls (p < 0.05). Factors affecting QoL in PCOS patients included socio-economic standing, time from PCOS diagnosis, BMI, age, and professional activity (p < 0.05). Factors affecting SwL in PCOS patients included socio-economic standing, having children, BMI, and time from PCOS diagnosis (p < 0.05). The higher the PCOS patients' QoL, the higher their SwL (p < 0.05). Further studies are required, focusing both on PCOS and its etiology, and on its impact on the women diagnosed with the disease.Copyright Â© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Context: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) report dissatisfaction with their early medical care. Little is understood about factors that can encourage stronger patient-provider relationships and promote treatment adherence. Objective(s): To compare trust in physicians and beliefs about social support from health care providers between women with and without PCOS. Design(s): Cross-sectional study with online questionnaire. Setting(s): Medical clinic referral or broader community recruitment via advertising and websites. Participant(s): Three hundred thirty-two US-based women with PCOS or with regular menses (n = 134 and n = 198, respectively). Main Outcome Measure(s): Trust and social support toward health care providers [primary care physicians (PCPs), specialists, and/or nurse practitioners and physician assistants]. Result(s): PCOS was associated with greater distrust in the PCP's opinion (P < 0.01) and greater confidence about the PCP's prioritization of general health concerns (P = 0.04) than the comparison group. Patients with PCOS felt that the PCP spent less effort and were less qualified to treat PCOS health concerns than general health concerns (both P < 0.001). No significant associations were observed between PCOS diagnosis and trust in specialists. When examining social support, women with PCOS felt they had more arguments with their health care providers than the comparison group (P = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS reported greater overall distrust in the PCP's opinions and more arguments with their health care providers than women without PCOS. These findings support a need to identify additional areas of improvement in the patient-provider relationship to ensure continuity of care for patients with PCOS who require life-long surveillance.Copyright Â© 2018 Endocrine Society.

N2  - Background/aim: Various studies have shown that adult patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have higher levels of anxiety and depression compared to their normal counterparts. However, it is still unclear whether these mood disorders already exist in adolescents affected by PCOS. The aim of the present study is to assess differences in anxiety and depression levels between adolescents with PCOS and age-and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls and to determine the possible factor(s) impacting these psychological parameters in adolescents with PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): The study included 80 adolescents with PCOS and 50 age-and BMI-matched controls. All participants completed standardized questionnaires assessing anxiety and depression. A multiple linear regression model was used to analyze the impact of potential variables on anxiety and depression scores of the adolescents with PCOS. Result(s): Significantly higher levels of anxiety, specifically generalized and social anxieties, as well as depression were found in adolescents with PCOS compared to controls. Higher BMI was found to be associated with higher levels of depression and generalized anxiety, and higher modified Ferriman-Gallwey score with higher level of panic disorder in adolescents affected by PCOS. Conclusion(s): Adolescents with PCOS experience significantly more emotional distress compared to adolescents without PCOS. This emotional distress may be related, at least in part, to certain clinical features of PCOS including obesity and hirsutism. PCOS in adolescents should be assessed not only for the gynecological and metabolic aspects but also for the emotional aspects of the disease.Copyright Â© TUBITAK.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and psychological disturbances, including anger. To analyze whether the biochemical/phenotypical features of PCOS play a role in the type and severity of psychological disorders. Material(s) and Method(s): This case-control study included 30 PCOS patients meeting NIH criteria and 30 non-PCOS women referring to Reproductive Medicine Unit for infertility. Complete clinical and biochemical screening and the self-reported psychological data [Symptom Check List 90-R (SCL-90-R); Short-Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36); and State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2)] were collected. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS-21. Result(s): Compared with control women, women with PCOS reported significantly higher scores on SCL-90-R scales of somatization, anxiety, hostility, psychoticism, overall psychological distress and a number of symptoms. At STAXI-2, patients with PCOS scored higher in trait-anger and in the outward expression of anger, while lower in outward anger-control; PCOS patients had significantly lower scores on SF-36 scales of physical functioning and bodily pain. Hirsutism was directly associated with anxiety. Regarding the associations between phenotypical/biochemical features and psychological distress in PCOS patients, results showed that waist-to-hip ratio is inversely related to anxiety, psychoticism, hostility and to the indexes of psychological distress; such inverse relationship was also seen between plasmatic levels of testosterone and trait-anger, and between total cholesterol and hostility. Conclusion(s): Results were consistent with the previous literature on the well-being of PCOS women (in particular for anxiety and quality of life [QoL]) but failed to find evidence for depression. The relationship between psychological distress and the features of the syndrome highlighted the role of hirsutism. With respect to hyperandrogenemia, our data rejected its involvement in the elevated negative mood states and affects. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach in the PCOS patients' care, anger showed to be common and deserves major consideration.Copyright Â© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Introduction: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome are susceptible to depression and anxiety and so may also be at risk for postnatal depression. This study investigates whether women with polycystic ovary syndrome have an elevated risk of postnatal depression. Material(s) and Method(s): Cross-sectional data for parous women (n = 566) were available from a birth cohort. Polycystic ovary syndrome was diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria. Details of reproductive history, pregnancy, birth, and postnatal depression were obtained through structured interview. Comparisons were made between women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome using logistic regression analysis, including the investigation of interactions. Result(s): A positive but statistically non-significant association was found between polycystic ovary syndrome and postnatal depression (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 0.9-2.9). Compared with their counterparts, women with polycystic ovary syndrome were substantially more likely: to have difficulty conceiving (odds ratio 5.2, 95% confidence interval 2.9-9.4), to have conceived with medical assistance (odds ratio 11.6, 95% confidence interval 5.5-24.4), and to have pregnancy complications (gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, or preeclampsia; odds ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.1-3.5). Where women with polycystic ovary syndrome had a history of miscarriage or conceived with medical assistance, the combination interacted (p = 0.06 and p < 0.05, respectively), with over half of such women having postnatal depression. Conclusion(s): Although women with polycystic ovary syndrome may not have an excess risk of postnatal depression overall, those who had suffered a miscarriage or required medical assistance to conceive were at substantially elevated risk. Findings point to vulnerability inherent in polycystic ovary syndrome being amplified, either by stressful experiences on the pathway to pregnancy/childbirth or by specific fertility treatment regimens.Copyright Â© 2018 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common condition among reproductive-aged women. However, its exact prevalence is unknown. Aim(s): To determine the prevalence of PCOS in Australian women aged 16-29 years using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria compared to self-reported PCOS, to compare co-morbidities between the groups and to determine the most distressing aspect of a diagnosis of PCOS for these young women. Material(s) and Method(s): Participants were recruited from the Young Female Health Initiative (YFHI) and Safe-D studies. Participants completed questionnaires, physical examinations and blood tests from 2012 to 2016. In March 2016, two supplementary questionnaires were distributed: the first, comprising questions on reproductive health and impact of diagnosis, was sent to participants who self-reported having PCOS in the original studies. The second, comprising general reproductive health questions, was sent to the remainder. Result(s): The prevalence of PCOS, according to the NIH criteria, was 12% (31/254), while the prevalence of self-reported PCOS was 8% (23/300). Only 35% (8/23) of those with self-reported PCOS actually fulfilled the NIH criteria for PCOS. Comorbidities were relatively similar among groups. Finally, approximately 65% (15/23) were unhappy or worried about their initial PCOS diagnosis, with 72% (13/18) stating fertility concerns were the most distressing aspect of their diagnosis. Conclusion(s): The lack of consistent and accurate diagnosis of PCOS in young women potentially leads to over-diagnosis. This creates unnecessary fears of health complications, particularly infertility. Therefore, we recommend the development of standardised criteria with set parameters that allow for better diagnosis of PCOS.Copyright Â© 2017 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists

N2  - Objective: To develop a question prompt list (QPL) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and explore its acceptability and feasibility. Design(s): Nationwide online survey, interviews, and clinical pilot test. Setting(s): Australia. Patient(s): Two-hundred and forty-nine women online, 18 women in interviews, and 20 women in clinics. Intervention(s): A QPL for PCOS. Main Outcome Measure(s): From survey, women's likeliness to use a QPL and priority topics; from interview, QPL user-friendliness and associated feelings; from pilot, women's QPL use, perceived helpfulness, and intended future use. Result(s): Evidence-based guidelines and multidisciplinary experts informed the QPL development. Of 249 survey respondents, 66.7% to 68.7% reported difficulty communicating with health care providers about mood, weight management, and how PCOS affects daily life, and 85.8% indicated they were very likely to use a PCOS QPL. Women were interviewed to explore acceptability; the semistructured interviews (n = 18) revealed that the devised QPL was easy to understand, user-friendly, and encouraged information seeking and targeted question asking. The refined QPL was pilot-tested in a clinic setting to explore feasibility between 2016 and 2017: 60.0% of women asked 1 to 2 questions from the QPL, 20.0% asked several questions, and 10.0% reported the QPL helped them generate their own questions. Women agreed the QPL was helpful (95.0%) and that they would use the QPL again (90.0%). Conclusion(s): The PCOS QPL is acceptable and feasible, and may assist women in information seeking and targeted question asking.Copyright Â© 2018 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - This article aims to identify and summarize the information, resource, and education needs of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and their healthcare providers. A systematic search of peer-reviewed, primary research literature was conducted. A total of 4,230 articles were identified, duplicates were removed, as well as the title and abstract of 2,819 studies and the full texts of 123 studies were screened against predetermined inclusion criteria. Findings from 35 included studies are described narratively. Main outcome measures include women's perceived needs for, and experiences of, PCOS care and information; healthcare providers' delivery of PCOS care and information; and healthcare providers' perceived needs for PCOS information, education programs, or professional development. There is a wealth of literature informing how PCOS information, education, and resources can better meet the needs of women, and about the role women expect healthcare providers to play in providing information within optimal PCOS care. However, few studies evaluate how well existing resources meet women's diverse needs. There is growing indirect evidence about the information and education needed by healthcare providers to provide best-practice PCOS care. However, little research has directly investigated healthcare providers' information needs or efficacy of PCOS-specific educational programs for healthcare providers. PCOS resources for women should be comprehensive, evidence-based, include the bio-psychosocial dimensions of the condition, and available through a variety of modes. The range of healthcare providers that women may seek care from need resources to support consistent use of the recommended diagnostic criteria, effective recommendation of lifestyle management, and early detection and treatment of symptoms and complications.Copyright Â© 2018 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

N2  - Background To inform knowledge translation by identifying evidence-practice gaps in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) care and variations between disciplines and across world regions via an online, anonymous, devised questionnaire distributed via professional societies and completed by 1,495 physicians (2015-2016). Methods Multivariable logistic regression analyses generated adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between outcome measures and world region, specialty, annual patients with PCOS, age, and sex. Results Features corresponding to Rotterdam diagnostic criteria were well recognized (e.g., irregular menstrual cycles by 99% of physicians), but psychological implications were recognized only by 29 to 64%. Reproductive endocrinologists were more likely to use Rotterdam diagnostic criteria (OR: 3.1; 95% CI: 2.3-4.3; p < 0.007) than obstetrician-gynecologists. Reproductive (OR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.5-2.8; p < 0.007) and medical endocrinologists (OR: 3.1; 95% CI: 1.7-5.7; p < 0.007) were more likely to recommend lifestyle management than obstetrician-gynecologists. Physicians in Europe (OR: 4.7; 95% CI: 3.5-6.1; p < 0.007) and other regions (OR: 4.0; 95% CI: 2.8-5.9; p < 0.007) were more likely to use Rotterdam diagnostic criteria than physicians in North America. Conclusion Knowledge gaps in PCOS care to be addressed internationally include physician awareness of the breadth of PCOS features, application of diagnostic criteria, and recommending lifestyle management effectively.Copyright Â© 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag.

N2  - Objective: To formulate clinical consensus recommendations for screening depression, anxiety, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and disordered eating symptoms in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and review prevalence based on phenotypes and ethnicity, changes over time, etiology, and impact of treatment. Design(s): Systematic reviews and preparation of position statement. Setting(s): Not applicable. Patient(s): Women with PCOS and controls screened using validated tools. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, disordered eating, and HRQoL scores. Result(s): Several studies demonstrate that women with PCOS have an increased prevalence of higher depression and anxiety scores and higher odds of moderate and severe depressive and anxiety symptoms compared with controls. Obesity, hyperandrogenism, and fertility have a weak association with these symptoms. HRQoL scores are consistently reduced in PCOS, with infertility and weight concerns having the most significant impact. Some studies suggest an increased prevalence of disordered eating in women with PCOS compared with controls. The few studies that have evaluated the impact of PCOS-related treatments (lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy) show no detrimental effect or some improvement in depressive and anxiety symptoms and HRQoL scores. Conclusion(s): In women with PCOS, screening for depressive and anxiety symptoms should be offered at the time of diagnosis and screening for disordered eating should be considered. Further research is required across PCOS phenotypes, in longitudinal cohorts and on impact of therapy on depressive and anxiety syptoms, HRQOL, and disordered eating.Copyright Â© 2018 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with biochemical and hormonal disturbance and adverse cosmetic, reproductive, metabolic, and psychological consequences, resulting in reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Various generic and specific questionnaires have been used for assessing different dimensions of HRQoL in PCOS women. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify those general and specific instruments and to determine the factors that affect HRQoL in PCOS women. Material(s) and Method(s): The research strategy involved general and specific terms in relation to PCOS women and their QoL. A review was performed on studies that were published between 1945 to 2017 and that were indexed in MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus. A narrative synthesis of the data was provided. Result(s): In total, 52 studies (9 qualitative and 43 quantitative) were included in the review. The analysis indicated that 3 specific and 5 general instruments were used to measure the QoL in PCOS women. Of these, the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (PCOSQ) were used most frequently. All studies assessed different aspects of QoL in PCOS women and found that PCOS had negative effects on QoL in this population. Conclusion(s): The PCOSQ and the SF-36 were used most frequently for the assessment of QoL in PCOS women. Perhaps using either a specific questionnaire solely or a specific questionnaire in conjunction with a generic measure would be more appropriate when measuring QoL in PCOS women. However, both questionnaires showed that they are able to capture different aspects of QoL in PCOS women and to identify areas that can help to improve QoL in these women.Copyright Â© 2018 Behboodi Moghadam et al.

N2  - Objectives: To study socio-cultural impact of PCOS on Indian Women especially those belonging to Economically Weaker Section (EWS). Methodology: It is a field work based study in which females suffering from PCOS were interviewed in the Outpatient Department (OPD) of a Government Hospital in Jammu. Majority of the respondents belonged to EWS and did not know anything about PCOS. Semi-structured interview schedule was used to interview patients who visited OPD for the treatment. Entire data were collected from 15th November 2016 to 31st December 2016. Information provided by respondents is used as narratives in the present study. Theories of stigma and social construction of illness have been used to analyse respondents' approach towards the disease and the way they perceive the onset of PCOS. Results and discussions: Entire discussion part has been sub-divided into: PCOS as a tabooed disease; infertility: a major consequence of PCOS; Lack of awareness about the disease; and social construction of PCOS. Respondents are found to have a grave concern about the disease due to their inability to adhere to the socially constructed role of a woman. Since, menstruation is still a tabooed topic of discussion in many parts of Indian society, hence they abstain from discussing about irregularity of periods till situation goes out of hand. Married women are marred by the stigma of infertility and unmarried ones fear future infertility. Conclusion(s): Lack of awareness and compulsion to fulfil socially expected role of a woman, women suffering from PCOS, in this part of India, aim only at becoming pregnant (in case of married women) and normalising their monthly periods (in case of unmarried females). However, there is need to spread awareness about PCOS and encouraging women to adopt knowledge, attitude and practice approach to manage this disease.Copyright Â© 2017

N2  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common androgen-excess disorder in reproductive-aged women, is often a missed diagnosis. Rural nurse practitioners (NPs) need to be able to diagnose and provide basic management for PCOS. This study's objective was to determine whether a continuing education program about PCOS would improve NPs' knowledge about PCOS. METHOD(S): A pretest-posttest design was used. Forty-eight participants attending a regional NP conference completed a pretest before a continuing education presentation about PCOS. Afterward, 43 participants completed an identical posttest. A two-step multivariate analysis of variance compared the results. RESULT(S): Pretest results indicated NPs had low levels of knowledge for assessing, diagnosing, and managing PCOS. The posttest results demonstrated significant (p = .000) improvements in these areas. CONCLUSION(S): Continuing education presentations have the potential to increase rural NPs' knowledge about PCOS so they can provide evidence-based care to rural women with PCOS.

N2  - Background: Adherence issues in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients have not been examined thoroughly. Patients report prolonged periods of treatment and side effects of the drug as the most common reason for withdrawal from treatment. To improve the effective management of PCOS patients, it is fundamental to understand facilitating and inhibiting factors to treatment adherence. Objective(s): To explore facilitating/inhibiting factors related to treatment adherence among PCOS patients. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a qualitative study with a purposive sample of women with confirmed diagnosis of PCOS. The data were collected via 20 in-depth semi-structured interviews with women aged between 21-34 yr. A qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the data. Result(s): Five themes were identified which described different types of facilitating/ inhibiting factors to treatment adherence. Inhibiting factors included financial issues, patient-related, disease-related, and health care provider-related factors; while social factors were found to be both facilitating and inhibiting. Conclusion(s): The findings suggest that successful adherence to PCOS treatment is highly dependent on patients recognizing and adapting to financial, social, and health care related inhibiting factors. It is also crucial for clinicians and policy makers to recognize these key inhibiting factors in order to improve treatment outcomes.Copyright Â© 2017, Research and Clinical Center for Infertitlity.

N2  - Background While female sexual dysfunction is a frequent occurrence, characteristics in infertile women are not well delineated. Furthermore, the impact of infertility etiology on the characteristics in women with differing androgen levels observed in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and unexplained infertility has not been assessed. Objective The objective of the study was to determine the characteristics of sexual dysfunction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and unexplained infertility. Study Design A secondary data analysis was performed on 2 of Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Cooperative Reproductive Medicine Networks clinical trials: Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Study II and Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations From Ovarian Stimulation. Both protocols assessed female sexual function using the Female Sexual Function Inventory and the Female Sexual Distress Scale. Results Women with polycystic ovary syndrome had higher weight and body mass index than women with unexplained infertility (each P < .001), greater phenotypic (Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism score, sebum score, and acne score; each P < .001), and hormonal (testosterone, free testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone; each P < .001) evidence of androgen excess. Sexual function scores, as assessed by the Female Sexual Function Inventory, were nearly identical. The Female Sexual Distress Scale total score was higher in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. The mean Female Sexual Function Inventory total score increased slightly as the free androgen index increased, mainly as a result of the desire subscore. This association was more pronounced in the women with unexplained infertility. Conclusion Reproductive-age women with infertility associated with polycystic ovary syndrome and unexplained infertility, despite phenotypic and biochemical differences in androgenic manifestations, do not manifest clinically significant differences in sexual function.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine condition in women, is often anecdotally associated with binge eating behaviours and food cravings; however there is a paucity of research. This study aimed to report the prevalence of binge eating and food cravings and their relation to obesity risk in women with PCOS. Participants completed an online survey including the Bulimia Investigatory Test, Edinburgh, Food Cravings-Trait Questionnaire and the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire revised-18. The study included obese (n = 340), overweight (n = 70) and lean (n = 45) women with PCOS and lean healthy women (n = 40). Sixty percent of obese women with PCOS were categorised with binge-eating behaviour, with 39% presenting with clinically significant behaviour. Obese women with PCOS presented with high mean food cravings-trait scores (131.6 +/- 28.9) that were significantly greater compared with lean (114.0 +/- 34.9) and overweight women with PCOS (120.1 +/- 29.5; p < 0.001). Multiple regression exploring relations between eating styles and adiposity explained 57% of the variance in binge eating symptom scores in women with PCOS (F = 130.4; p < 0.001, n = 463): significant predictors were food cravings total score (beta = 0.53; p < 0.001), emotional eating score (beta = 0.18; p < 0.001), body mass index (beta = 0.11; p < 0.001) and uncontrolled eating score (beta = 0.009; p = 0.02). Compared with lean healthy women, lean women with PCOS exhibited significantly higher binge eating symptom scores (10.9 +/- 7.8 versus 7.4 +/- 6.0; p < 0.05), though similar total food craving scores (114.0 +/- 34.9 versus 105.6 +/- 26.6: NS). This study is the largest, to date, to robustly report that a high proportion of women with PCOS exhibit binge eating behaviours. We recommend screening women with PCOS for binge eating behaviours to help inform the choice of weight management approach for this clinical population.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Objective To determine the prevalence of eating disorders (EDs) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the effects of EDs on health-related quality of life. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting University practice. Patient(s) Women with PCOS (Rotterdam criteria; n = 148) and controls seen for routine gynecologic care (n = 106) from 2015 to 2016. Intervention(s) Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (PCOSQ). Main Outcome Measure(s) EDE-Q and NEQ scores, prevalence of bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), and night eating syndrome (NES). Result(s) Women with PCOS were at an increased risk for overall abnormal EDE-Q scores compared with controls (12.16% vs. 2.83%; odds ratio [OR], 4.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36, 16.58). Clinically significant elevated scores were noted for shape and weight concern. In unadjusted analysis, body mass index (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01, 1.11), elevated depression score (OR, 5.43; 95% CI, 1.85, 15.88), and elevated anxiety score (OR, 6.60; 95% CI, 2.45, 17.76) were associated with an abnormal EDE-Q global score. In the multivariable model, PCOS was associated with abnormal EDE-Q global score (adjusted OR, 4.67; 95% CI, 1.16, 18.80). Elevated EDE-Q scores inversely correlated with PCOSQ scores (r = -0.57). The prevalence of BN was 6.1%, of BED was 17.6%, and of NES was 12.9% in women with PCOS, with no differences compared with controls. Conclusion(s) Women with PCOS, especially those with concurrent anxiety symptoms but independent of obesity, have a significantly increased risk of abnormal EDE-Q scores. Our findings suggest the need for routine screening for ED in this population.Copyright Â© 2016 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - In this study, we aimed to examine the relationship between atypical depression and insulin resistance (IR) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and major depression. A total of 176 subjects (69 patients with PCOS, 58 patients with depression, and 49 healthy controls) were included in the study. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and the Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) were administered. Data concerning their height, weight, fasting a.m. serum levels of insulin, glucose level, and total testosterone level were collected from all participants. The body mass index (BMI) and the Homeostasis Model Assessment Insulin Resistance index (HOMA-IR) were both calculated. 34 (49.3%) of the PCOS patients met the criteria for depression. 26 (76.5%) of them had atypical depression, 8 (23.5%) had non-atypical depression. 27 (46.6%) of the 58 depressed patients had atypical depression. Insulin resistance was higher in the PCOS patients than in the control subjects and the depression patients. There was no association between atypical depression and IR in patients with PCOS and depression. We concluded that there is no relationship between IR and atypical depression.Copyright Â© 2017

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased psychological distress, obesity and hyperandrogenism being suggested as key promoters. Objective(s): To investigate the prevalence of anxiety/depression and their coexistence in women with PCOS/PCOS-related symptoms at ages 31 and 46. The roles of obesity, hyperandrogenism, and awareness of PCOS on psychological distress were also assessed. Design(s): Population-based follow-up. Setting(s): Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 with 15-year follow-up. Participant(s): At age 31, a questionnaire-based screening for oligoamenorrhea (OA) and hirsutism (H): 2188 asymptomatic (controls), 331 OA, 323 H, and 125 OA plus H (PCOS). Follow-up at age 46: 1576 controls, 239 OA, 231 H, and 85 PCOS. Intervention(s): Questionnaire-based screening for anxiety and depression symptoms (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25) and previously diagnosed/treated depression at ages 31 and 46. Body mass index (BMI), serum testosterone/free androgen index, and awareness of polycystic ovaries/ PCOS on psychological distress were also assessed. Main Outcomes: Population-based prevalence of anxiety and/or depression in women with PCOS/ PCOS-related symptoms at ages 31 and 46. Result(s): Anxiety and/or depression symptoms, their coexistence, and rate of depression were increased at ages 31 and 46 in women with PCOS or isolated H compared with controls. High BMI or hyperandrogenism did not associate with increased anxiety or depression symptoms. The awareness of PCOS was associated with increased anxiety. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS or isolated H present more often with anxiety and/or depression symptoms and their coexistence compared with controls. High BMI or hyperandrogenism did not provoke psychological distress in PCOS. The awareness of PCOS increased anxiety but did not associate with severe anxiety or depression.Copyright Â© 2017 Endocrine Society.

N2  - Aims: To evaluate the temperament and quality of life (QoL) of patients with PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-three adult patients with PCOS and 38 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Demographic characteristics including age, education and body mass index (BMI) were recorded. Affective temperaments were assessed by the temperament evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-autoquestionnaire version (TEMPS-A) scale. The general health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instrument used in this study was short Form 36. Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) were also performed. Result(s): The patients with PCOS had significantly higher rates of depressive, anxious and hyperthymic scores compared to controls. The PCOS patients had significantly lower mean SF-36 health summary scores. Conclusion(s): TEMPS-A seems to be an easy and reliable test to evaluate temperament in PCOS patients.Copyright Â© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Objective To identify gaps in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) knowledge and practice patterns among physicians in North America in response to significant dissatisfaction identified among women with PCOS regarding their diagnosis and treatment experience. Design Online survey conducted via American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology of gynecologists (ObGyn) and American Society of Reproductive Medicine of reproductive endocrinologists (REI-ObGyn) in 2015-16. Setting Not applicable. Patient(s) None. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Diagnostic criteria used, key features of PCOS, management practices. Result(s) Of the 630 surveys completed, 70.2% were ObGyn and 64.4% were females. Overall 27.7% respondents did not know which PCOS diagnostic criteria they used. In a multivariable analysis including physician type, age, gender, and number of patients with PCOS seen annually, REI-ObGyn were less likely compared with ObGyn to report not knowing which criteria they used (adjusted odds ratio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.04, 0.16). REI-ObGyn were more likely to use the Rotterdam criteria (odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.33, 3.82). The majority of respondents recognized the clinical features associated with PCOS; however, over one-third associated "cysts on ovaries" with PCOS. The majority of responders (>85%) were aware of cardiometabolic comorbidities; however, fewer ObGyn were aware of associated depression, anxiety disorders, and reduced quality of life. More REI-ObGyn recommended lifestyle changes compared with ObGyn (56.4% vs. 41.6%). Conclusion(s) Our large-scale PCOS survey, conducted in response to patient concerns regarding diagnosis and treatment, highlights opportunities for physician education. Focus areas include targeting knowledge of internationally accepted Rotterdam criteria and ensuring consistent care informed by evidence-based guidelines across the reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features of PCOS.Copyright Â© 2017 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex, chronic, and under-recognized disorder. Diagnosis experience may have lasting effects on well-being and self-management. Objective(s): To investigate PCOS diagnosis experiences, information provided, and concerns about PCOS. Design(s): Cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire. Setting(s): Recruitment via support group web sites in 2015 to 2016. Participant(s): There were 1385 women with a reported diagnosis of PCOS who were living in North America (53.0%), Europe (42.2%), or other world regions (4.9%); of these, 64.8% were 18 to 35 years of age. Main Outcome Measure(s): Satisfaction with PCOS diagnosis experience, satisfaction with PCOS information received at the time of diagnosis, and current concerns about PCOS. Result(s): One-third or more of women reported >2 years (33.6%) and >=3 health professionals (47.1%) before a diagnosis was established. Few were satisfied with their diagnosis experience (35.2%) or with the information they received (15.6%). Satisfaction with information received was positively associated with diagnosis satisfaction [odds ratio (OR), 7.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.9 to 9.9]; seeing >=5 health professionals (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.8) and longer time to diagnosis (.>2 years; OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.6) were negatively associated with diagnosis satisfaction (independent of time since diagnosis, age, and world region). Women's most common concerns were difficulty losing weight (53.6%), irregular menstrual cycles (50.8%), and infertility (44.5%). Conclusion(s): In the largest study of PCOS diagnosis experiences, many women reported delayed diagnosis and inadequate information. These gaps in early diagnosis, education, and support are clear opportunities for improving patient experience.Copyright Â© 2017 by the Endocrine Society.

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a lifelong condition. Its symptoms have been linked with psychological consequences, but less attention has been given to the daily implications of living with PCOS. We aimed to explore women's experiences living with PCOS, and the potential acceptability of group education sessions for this target group. Method(s): Women with PCOS were recruited from an ethnically diverse UK community. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted. Analysis was underpinned by the constant comparative approach and involved the identification and exploration of key themes. Result(s): Participants reported a range of symptoms linked with PCOS, including problems relating to menstruation and weight difficulties. Hirsutism was reported as the most distressing symptom. Emergent themes included perceptions about symptoms and delays in receiving a diagnosis; psychological distress; practical implications of living with the condition; coping with PCOS and perceived support needs. Some findings were specific to cultural backgrounds. Participants were supportive of the idea of group education for women with PCOS and suggested a need to provide education within the community and health care providers. Discussion(s): Women with PCOS experience high psychological distress and difficulties with coping with their condition. Suggested strategies to reduce the negative psychological impact include education at various levels.Copyright Â© 2017 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.

N2  - There is no consensus regarding the impact of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and its hormonal profile on sexual function of affected women; majority of data documented are not population based and there is a lack of studies investigating the association between hormonal profiles with sexual function in women with PCOS. We aimed to compare the sexual function of PCOS women with controls in a population-based study based on their hormonal profiles. In this cross-sectional study, sexual function (using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire) and hormonal profiles were determined in 63 PCOS subjects and 216 healthy women (controls); aged 18-45 years. A comparison of PCOS women and controls showed no statistically significant difference in total FSFI and each of its specific domain scores. There were significant positive correlations between dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and total FSFI, orgasm and satisfaction domains in controls (r=0.156, r=0.206, r=0.275, respectively). No significant correlations between hormonal profiles and FSFI scores were found in the PCOS group, except for prolactin and orgasm (r=-0.250). In conclusion, sexual function did not differ between PCOS women and controls. High levels of androgens in women with PCOS were not associated with an improvement in sexual function.

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by phenotypic heterogeneity and has a wide variety of consequences. Approximately half of women with PCOS are over-weight or obese, and their obesity may be a contributing factor to PCOS pathogenesis through different mechanisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate if PCOS alone affects the patients' quality of life and to what extent obesity contributes to worsen this disease. Design(s): To evaluate the impact of PCOS on health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), 100 Mediterranean women with PCOS (group A), 50 with a body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2 (group A1) and 50 with BMI < 25 kg/m2 (group A2), were recruited. They were evaluated with a specific combination of standardized psychometric questionnaires: the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised, the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Questionnaire. The patients were compared with a normal-weight healthy control group of 40 subjects (group B). Another control group of 40 obese healthy women (group C) was used to make a comparison with PCOS obese patients (A1). Result(s): Our results showed a considerable worsening of HRQoL in PCOS patients (A) com-pared with controls (B). In addition, patients with PCOS and BMI > 25 (A1) showed a significant and more marked reduction in scores, suggesting a lower quality of life, compared with controls (B) and with normal-weight PCOS patients (A2). Conclusion(s): PCOS is a complex disease that alone determines a deterioration of HRQoL. The inno-vative use of these psychometric questionnaires in this study, in particular the PCOS questionnaire, has highlighted that obesity has a negative effect on HRQoL. It follows that a weight decrease is associated to phenotypic spectrum improvement and relative decrement in psychological distress.Copyright Â© 2017 Panico et al.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and its characteristic symptoms have been associated with physical and psychological issues in women of reproductive age. The current study was conducted in response to the dearth of systematic research related to psychological functioning and quality of life in patients with PCOS in Southwest China, and to determine whether patients with PCOS exhibit poorer mental health (MH) compared to healthy women of the same age and living in the same region, without a PCOS diagnosis. Method(s): We enrolled 120 outpatients with PCOS and 100 healthy controls in this study. Standardized questionnaires were administered to assess general MH conditions (General Health Questionnaire-12-item version), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), as well as health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measured using the 36-item short-form health survey. The independent samples t-test was conducted for continuous study variables. For categorical variables, the Pearson Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression were performed. Result(s): The prevalence of anxiety (13.3% vs. 2.0%) and depression (27.5% vs. 3.0%) was higher in patients with PCOS compared to the controls (both P < 0.05). Patients with PCOS had decreased HRQoL. Patients with PCOS who had fertility requirements were more likely to be anxious and depressed than those without fertility requirements (anxiety: 22.6% [12/53] vs. 5.9% [4/67], chi2 = 7.117, P = 0.008; depression: 37.7% (20/53) vs.19.4% (13/67), chi2 = 4.988, P = 0.026). Conclusion(s): PCOS and related symptoms may be risk factors for depression and anxiety. Professionals should be concerned with the MH of women with PCOS, and psychological therapy should be considered.Copyright Â© 2017 Chinese Medical Journal.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a major endocrine disorder afflicting women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS are more likely to suffer from mental health disturbances than healthy women. The "infertility" suffered by PCOS patients would also lead to mental health disturbances. Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) and questionnaire which includes patients' socio-economic and demographic data were used to assess the mental health status of PCOS (n=103) and non-PCOS (n=110) infertile patients. Logistic regression analysis and t-tests were used for comparative analysis. The data demonstrated that scores of depression, interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive-compulsive, and hostility symptoms in PCOS infertile patients were significantly higher than those in the non-PCOS infertile patients (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that acne had negative effect on mental health status (P<0.05). Secondary infertile PCOS patients were more easily to suffer from somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, hostility and paranoid ideation symptoms than the primary infertile PCOS patients (P<0.05). The results suggested that the PCOS patients especially the secondary infertile PCOS patients had obvious mental health disturbances. The acne might play an importance role in the occurrence of mental health disturbances in PCOS patients. PCOS related symptoms may be risk factors of mental health status in PCOS patients with infertility. More attention should be paid to the PCOS infertile patients, and mental health therapy should be considered if necessary.

N2  - AIMS: To explore the impact of the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome on health/ill health identity, how women experience this diagnosis and their health beliefs., BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common and heterogeneous condition, giving rise to a wide range of different health concerns. Previous research on polycystic ovary syndrome has been dominated by the medical perspective and less is known about the experiences and needs of women., DESIGN: A qualitative study of 32 premenopausal adult women with polycystic ovary syndrome (diagnosis confirmed by Rotterdam criteria), aged between 18 and 45 years, recruited from a primary and secondary care setting., METHODS: Thematic analysis of transcripts from 11 focus groups conducted between 2013-2015., RESULTS/FINDINGS: Women identified a range of concerns affecting personal and reproductive identity, health knowledge and beliefs: (1) delays and barriers to diagnosis; (2) general lack of empathy by the medical profession; (3) difficulty in accessing specialist referral; (4) lack of information from professionals; (5) inconsistent and sometimes unsatisfactory experiences with medications; (6) insufficient help and advice regarding in/fertility; (7) relative lack of awareness or concern about longer term risks such as diabetes; and (8) significant discrepancies between the beliefs of women with polycystic ovary syndrome and how they experienced the attitudes of healthcare professionals., CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be a divergence between women's experience and attitudes of healthcare professionals. The diagnosis, support and lived experience of women with polycystic ovary syndrome could be enhanced by better professional recognition of these concerns, improved knowledge and communication about polycystic ovary syndrome and better access to support and specialist advice.Copyright Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The objective of this study was to conduct a process evaluation of a pilot clinic on Thursday Island which aimed to provide a comprehensive evidence-based service for women with PCOS throughout the Torres Strait., DESIGN: Mixed-method evaluation at 12 months comprising a medical record audit, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions., SETTING: Primary care., PARTICIPANTS: Audit of n = 11 clinics (n = 36 women), qualitative semi-structured interviews with n = 8 clinicians and focus group discussions with n = 8 women., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (i) Fidelity to evidence-based guidelines, (ii) barriers and enablers to women using the service, (iii) the ability to meet the needs of women and the community., RESULTS: The clinic was largely successful in providing evidence-based care with up to 78% of women receiving recommended cardiometabolic screening, 100% emotional screening and 89% lifestyle management despite the remoteness of the clinic and limited financial and human resources. Health care providers report sustainability of the clinic will be dependent on factors including staffing, administrative support and inclusion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers., CONCLUSION: While the clinic has been largely successful there are areas identified for potential improvement and to facilitate sustainability which should be considered before up-scaling this model to a national level. These include systems, administrative and staffing support, engaging with other community services to facilitate lifestyle changes and ongoing engagement and upskilling of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health care providers.Copyright Â© 2016 National Rural Health Alliance Inc.

N2  - Background: Data on dietary intake, meal patterns, and eating attitudes from women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is limited despite the fact that PCOS is associated with obesity. We aimed to test the hypothesis that women with PCOS display altered dietary intakes and eating behaviors compared to controls. Method(s): Women with PCOS (n = 72) as defined according to the modified Rotterdam criteria were compared with healthy controls (n = 30). Anthropometry included measurement of waist circumference and determination of the resting metabolic rate via indirect calorimetry. All women completed questionnaires regarding eating behavior; Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R21) and eating attitudes; Eating Attitudes Test (EAT). Group comparisons were done by Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression analysis was used for adjustments of age and BMI in a non-parametric way. Result(s): BMI was higher in women with PCOS compared to controls. Resting metabolic rate did not differ between women with women with and without PCOS after adjustment for age and BMI [1411 +/- 229 kcal/day versus 1325 +/- 193 kcal per day (P = 0.07)], whereas the respiratory exchange ratio was higher in women with PCOS than in controls [0.83 +/- 0.07 versus 0.78 +/- 0.08 (P = 0.02 after adjustments for age and BMI)]. Energy percent (E%) carbohydrates was higher in women with PCOS compared to controls (P = 0.017), but E% alcohol was lower (P = 0.036) after adjustment for age and BMI. The average total EAT scores and EAT dieting subscale scores were higher in women with PCOS compared with controls (P = 0.001 and P = 0.024, respectively) after adjustment for age and BMI. No difference was found for previous or current symptoms of bulimia nervosa. Conclusion(s): Independent of BMI and age, the resting metabolic rate did not differ between women with and without PCOS indicating that women with PCOS should have equal abilities in terms of energy metabolism to lose weight as women without PCOS. Women with PCOS showed greater concerns about their weight and dieting, and this indicates that anxiety about weight is one of the psychological symptoms of PCOS.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

N2  - Background/aim: To evaluate psychological parameters and health quality profiles in women with reproductive polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes and age matched controls. Material(s) and Method(s): The study groups included 101 women with PCOS (54 with the National Institutes of Health [NIH] phenotype and 47 with the non-NIH phenotype) and 49 healthy female controls. The participants completed anxiety and depression scales and four quality of life domains. Result(s): We identified the women with PCOS as having a 3.39 times increased risk for depression (subscale >= 7) and a 3.64 times increased risk for anxiety (subscale >= 10) compared to the controls. Both NIH and non-NIH phenotypes showed similar rates of depression (46.3% vs. 46.8%, respectively; P = 0.57) and anxiety (31.5% vs. 36.2%, respectively; P = 0.47). Regarding the quality of life scale, the women with NIH PCOS had significantly lower mental health scores compared to those with non-NIH PCOS (P = 0.03). Furthermore, while mental health scores were similar in the women with PCOS and the controls, physical health scores were significantly lower in the women with PCOS (P = 0.007). Conclusion(s): Nearly half of the women with PCOS had higher depression scores and one third had higher anxiety scores. Thus, psychiatric evaluations appear necessary for PCOS patients in order to diagnose and treat clinical depression and anxiety.Copyright Â© TUBITAK.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder affecting 5-15% of reproductive-aged women and characterized by high levels of circulating androgens. Given that androgens have been implicated in the aetiology of several psychiatric disorders, it was hypothesized that women with PCOS have high risk for psychiatric comorbidity. We aimed to investigate this risk amongst women with PCOS, as well as in their siblings, to elucidate if familial factors underlie any potential associations. Using the Swedish national registers, we identified all women diagnosed with PCOS between 1990 and 2013 (n = 24,385), their full-siblings (n = 25,921), plus matched individuals (1:10/100) from the general population and their full-siblings. Psychiatric disorder diagnoses were identified including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depressive and anxiety disorders, eating disorders, personality and gender identity disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), tics, attempted and completed suicide. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using conditional logistic regression and adjusted ORs (AOR) were determined by adjustment for comorbid psychiatric disorders. Overall, women with PCOS had an increased odds of having at least one psychiatric disorder (OR = 1.56 [95CI%, 1.51-1.61]). Crude ORs showed associations with nearly all psychiatric disorders included in this study. Following adjustment for comorbid psychiatric disorders, women with PCOS were still at a significantly increased risk for bulimia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depressive and anxiety disorders, personality disorders, with the highest AORs for ASD (AOR = 1.55 [95%CI, 1.32-1.81]) and tics (AOR = 1.65 [95%CI, 1.10-2.47]). Significantly higher AORs were found for ASD in both brothers and sisters of women with PCOS, and for depressive, anxiety, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders in the sisters only. Notably, the crude ORs for attempted suicide were 40% higher in women with PCOS and 16% higher in their unaffected sisters. However, the AORs were greatly attenuated indicating that underlying psychiatric comorbidity is important for this association. Women with PCOS had higher risks for a range of psychiatric disorders not shown before. Elevated risk in their siblings suggests shared familial factors between PCOS and psychiatric disorders. This study is an important first step towards identifying the underlying mechanisms for risk of psychiatric disorders in women with PCOS. Health professionals treating women with PCOS should be aware that these patients - as well as their family members - are important targets for mental health care.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder which affects 6.6% of women of child-bearing age. Although olfactory dysfunction is frequent in the population and it negatively affects quality of life, neither physicians or patients consider this important. This case-control study included 30 patients diagnosed with PCOS, and 25 healthy age-matched controls. Sniffin' sticks tests (BurghartGmbH, Wedel, Germany) were used to analyze olfactory functions, and the Beck Depression Inventory was used to evaluate depressive symptoms. The total odor score was significantly lower in the PCOS group compared to the control group (p < 0.005). The Beck depression score was higher in the PCOS group (p < 0.005). There was a negative correlation between the total odor score and the Beck Depression Score. Patients with PCOS have impaired olfactory function. This might be related to depressive disorders that are also observed in those patients.Copyright Â© 2016

N2  - Background: It is assumed that obesity adversely affects the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), not only due to the excess weight, but also due to several other obesity induced metabolic and reproductive consequences. We aimed to compare the effects of excess body weight on the HRQOL between women with PCOS and controls. Method(s): This is a case control study of 142 women with PCOS and 140 age- and BMI- matched controls. The Iranian version of short form health survey 36 (SF 36) was used to assess HRQOL. Domains of SF 36 were compared in women with PCOS and controls using multivariate analysis of covariance. The Pearson correlation was used to assess the correlation between body mass index (BMI) and domain scores of SF 36, and the differences between two correlations in cases and controls, using Fisher's Z test. Result(s): Women with PCOS had significantly lower scores for both, the physical and the mental component summary scales, compared to controls. In the cases, a significant negative correlations were observed for BMI with physical function (r = - 0.301, P<0.001), bodily pain (r = - 0.23, P = 0.006), and physical summary score (r = -0.3, P = 0.007). In controls, significant correlation was seen for BMI with bodily pain (r = - 0.3, P<0.001) and physical summary score (r = - 0.27, P = 0.001). The differences between correlations of physical function with BMI in PCOS and controls were statistically significant (Z = -2.41, P = 0.008). Conclusion(s): Although the physical aspects of HRQOL are adversely affected by overweight in both PCOS and controls, these impaired effects are greater in women with PCOS.Copyright Â© 2016 Shishehgar et al.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome affects 6percent of women. Symptoms include hirsutism, acne, and infertility. This research explores the impact of polycystic ovary syndrome on women's lives using photovoice. Nine participants photographed objects related to their quality of life and made diary entries explaining each photograph. Three themes emerged from thematic analysis of the diaries: control (of symptoms and polycystic ovary syndrome controlling their lives), perception (of self, others, and their situation), and support (from relationships, health care systems, and education). These findings illuminate positive aspects of living with polycystic ovary syndrome and the role pets and social networking sites play in providing support for women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

N2  - Purpose Aerobic exercises may improve quality of life (QoL) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, there is no data on the effect of resistance exercise training (RET) programs on the QoL of women with PCOS. Thus, this study aimed to assess the effect of a 16-week RET program on QoL in PCOS women. Methods This 16-week case-control study enrolled 43 women with PCOS (PCOS group, PCOSG) and 51 healthy pre-menopausal controls aged 18 to 37 years (control group, CG). All women underwent a supervised RET program for 16 weeks, and were evaluated in two different occasions: week-0 (baseline), and week-16 (after RET). Quality of life was assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Results Testosterone reduced significantly in both groups after RET (p<0.01). The PCOSG had improvements in functional capacity at week-16 relative to week-0 (p=0.02). The CG had significant improvements in vitality, social aspects, and mental health at week-16 relative to week-0 (p<=0.01). There was a weak correlation between social aspects of the SF-36 domain and testosterone levels in PCOS women. Conclusion A 16-week RET program modestly improved QoL in women with PCOS.

N2  - Study question: Is there an excess of sleep disturbances inwomenwith polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS) in a community-based sample? Study answer: Sleep disturbances are almost twice as common in women with PCOS compared with women of similar age without PCOS, with the association slightly accounted for by body weight and, to a greater extent, by depressive symptoms. What is known already: There is an excess of sleep-disordered breathing in clinical samples of women with PCOS, after accounting for their profile of body weight. Poor sleep patterns increase insulin resistance and thus may exacerbate PCOS symptoms and longer-term risk of metabolic disease. Study design, size, duration: Across-sectional study of 724 women, comprising 74% of a cohort study established retrospectively when women were around age 30 years. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Comparisons were made between 87womenwithPCOS, diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria, and 637 women without this diagnosis in Adelaide, South Australia. Differences in sleep disturbances, assessed using a modified version of the Jenkins questionnaire, were investigated using ordered logistic regression. Main results and the role of chance: Sleep disturbances were twice as common in women with PCOS compared with those without. Specifically, PCOS was associated with increasing occurrence of difficulty falling asleep (odds ratio (OR) 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28-2.95); this association was attenuated but still statistically significant after accounting for BMI and depressive symptoms. Increasing occurrence of difficulty maintaining sleep (OR 1.92 95% CI 1.12-3.31) was mediated by obesity and depressive symptoms, together. Other factors did not change these findings. Limitations, reasons for caution: The cross-sectional nature of the study means that the direction of associations between PCOS and sleep disturbances is unclear, although bi-directionality for the mediators is likely based on data in the wider literature. Wider implications of the findings: Our results indicate that assessment and management of both sleep and mental health problems in women with PCOS should be undertaken. Longitudinal data would be valuable to see how poor sleep affects longer-term health profiles.Copyright Â© The Author 2014.

N2  - Introduction: There is a need for specific measures to address overall care in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Physical resistance training (PRT) has been shown to improve certain body parameters. However, the effect of PRT on the sexual function of PCOS women has not been evaluated. Aim(s): The study aimed to assess sexual function and emotional status of PCOS women after 16 weeks of PRT. Method(s): This case-control study involved 43 women with PCOS and 51 control ovulatory women, aged 18-37 years. All women were subjected to a supervised PRT protocol for 16 weeks and evaluated at the end of the program. Sexual function was assessed at baseline and after PRT protocol. Main Outcome Measure(s): The main outcome measure used was the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Result(s): Of the 43 women with PCOS, 30 (69.70%) had a basal total FSFI score<=26.55 and 24 of them (58.54%) had a score<=26.55 after PRT (P=0.08). Of the 51 control women, 32 (62.7%) and 27 (52.9%) had FSFI scores<26.55 at baseline and after PRT, respectively (P=0.06). Control women experienced a significant improvement in pain domain score after PRT (P<0.03). PCOS women experienced significant increases in total score and in the desire, excitement and lubrication domains after PRT (P<0.01 each). After PRT, there was a significant difference between the PCOS and control groups in the sexual desire domain (4.09+/-1.29 vs. 3.75+/-1.42, P=0.04). Significantly fewer women in the PCOS group were at risk of depression (P<0.01) and anxiety (P<0.02) after than before PRT, whereas the differences in the control group were not significant. Mean depression and anxiety scores were reduced significantly in both the PCOS (P<0.01 each) and control (P<0.01) groups. Conclusion(s): PRT significantly enhanced total score and the desire, excitement, and lubrication domains of the FSFI in PCOS women. PRT reduced pain, and total depression and anxiety scores in both groups. Lara LAS, Ramos FKP, Kogure GS, Silva Costa, Silva de Sa MF, Ferriani RA, and dos Reis, RM.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome is frequently related to obesity and hyperandrogenism that potentially may impair sexual function. This case-control study aimed to determine the effect of the polycystic ovary syndrome on the sexual functioning of obese women and to determine which body measures can predict sexual functioning among 87 sexually active women obese women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome, 18-40 years old, divided in two groups; obese women (n = 44) or obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (n = 43). The groups were compared using the Sexual Quotient-Female version and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scales, and by serum tests. No significant difference between groups was observed in weight, waist-hip ratio, body mass index, serum glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, total testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, total Sexual Quotient-Female version score, and the total score of <= 60 for subjects (risk for sexual dysfunction) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression. Significant difference was observed in age, parity, and Free Androgen Index. Each unit increase in waist-hip ratio conferred a greater chance of score of <= 60. A height of less than 161 cm and the presence of depression were found to be risk factors with a score of <= 60. Women with a score of <= 60 had significantly smaller hip measurements and waist-hip ratio. The presence of polycystic ovary syndrome was not a risk factor for decreased sexual functioning.

N2  - Background Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are reported to experience depressive episodes at a higher rate than healthy controls (HC). Affective temperament features are psychiatric markers that may help to predict and identify vulnerability to depression in women with PCOS. Our aim was to evaluate the affective temperaments of women with PCOS and to investigate the association with depression and anxiety levels and laboratory variables in comparison with HC. Methods The study included 71 women with PCOS and 50 HC. Hormonal evaluations were performed for women with PCOS. Physical examination, clinical history, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and TEMPS-A were performed for all subjects. Differences between groups were evaluated using Student's t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests. Correlations and logistic regression tests were performed. Results All temperament subtype scores, except hyperthymic, and HADS anxiety, depression, and total scores were significantly higher in patients with PCOS compared to HC. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between BMI and irritable temperament, and insulin and HADS depression scores in patients with PCOS. Additionally, hirsutism score and menstrual irregularity were correlated with HADS depression, anxiety and total scores in PCOS patients. In logistic regression analysis, depression was not affected by PCOS, hirsutism score or menstrual irregularity. However, HADS anxiety score was associated with hirsutism score. Conclusions Our study is the first to evaluate the affective temperament features of women with PCOS. Consequently, establishing affective temperament properties for women with PCOS may help clinicians predict those patients with PCOS who are at risk for depressive and anxiety disorders.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine practice patterns for insulin resistance (IR) evaluation and management in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) among physician members of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). STUDY DESIGN: Crosssectional survey using a web-based questionnaire. RESULT(S): A total of 205 members responded. Respondents were board-certified (94%), or board-eligible (6%), in obstetrics and gynecology. Sixty-four percent of the respondents use the Rotterdam 2003 Criteria for a diagnosis of PCOS. Two-thirds (68%) screen for IR in women with PCOS. Respondents who screen for IR were more likely to also screen for diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.48-7.21). The 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test with glucose and insulin concentrations was the most common IR screening test used (45%). Metformin therapy was used by 33% of respondents for "all women with PCOS who have IR." The majority (68%) responded that there is a need for a committee opinion from ASRM on IR testing in PCOS. CONCLUSION(S): Two-thirds of ASRM physician members surveyed screen women with PCOS for IR in spite of the lack of general consensus on the need for such screening from endocrine societies.Copyright Â© Journal of Reproductive Medicine, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: To assess sexual function (SF) and quality of life (QOL) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess 56 women with PCOS and 102 control women with regular menstrual cycles. To assess SF and QOL in Brazilian women with PCOS with Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the WHOQOL-bref questionnaires. Result(s): Women with PCOS had a worse evaluation to arousal, lubrication, satisfaction, pain and total FSFI, and there was no difference in sexual desire and orgasm. Besides, they had a worse evaluation concerning health status than controls. The body mass index was inversely correlated to the QOL, especially to the physical, psychological, environment aspects and self-assessment of QOL, but it did not show correlation to the SF. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS had a worse sexual function and self-assessment of health condition in comparison to controls. The body weight as isolated symptom was correlated to the worsening in quality of life, but not with the worsening of sexual function.Copyright Â© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare sexual function and sexual response, attitude toward sexuality and relationships with sexual partners in women diagnosed with PCOS and healthy controls., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 73 women (aged 23-42 years) diagnosed with PCOS using the Rotterdam criteria and 45 healthy controls. All participants completed a questionnaire assessing socioepidemiological parameters and sexual behavior. Validated instruments were used to assess hirsutism (Ferriman-Gallwey Scale), mental health status (General Health Questionnaire 12 [GHQ 12]), sexuality (Sexuality Scale [SS], Sexual Awareness Questionnaire [SAQ], Multidimensional Sexuality Questionnaire [MSQ], Multidimensional Sexual Self-Concept Questionnaire [MSSCQ]), and sexual function (Polish version of the Mell-Krat Scale [SFK/K Scale])., RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in the importance of sexual activity in both groups. Mean scores for the SFK/K Scale, SS, SAQ, MSQ, and MSSQ were similar among women with PCOS and controls, regardless of age. Similarly sexual needs and reactions were perceived in the same way by both groups. In contrast, women with PCOS rated themselves negatively as sexual partners more frequently than controls., CONCLUSIONS: Sexual function and sexual response, attitude toward sexuality as well as relationships with sexual partners were similar in PCOS subjects and healthy women. However, changes in physical appearance typically associated with PCOS result in deterioration of sexual function. Therefore, it is recommended that all PCOS patients should be referred to a sexual medicine specialist for consultation.

N2  - Background. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common and complex endocrine condition affecting women across the lifespan. Diagnosis experience may impact on physical and emotional well-being and engagement with evidence-based management and treatment. Objective. To explore the perceived experience of PCOS diagnosis, prior to development of an evidence-based guideline for PCOS assessment and management. Methods. Cross-sectional study, involving devised questionnaires completed by a national, community-based sample of 210 women with a previous medical diagnosis of PCOS, aged 18-45 years, in Australia. Main outcome measures included time to diagnosis, number of health professionals seen and information provision. Results. Mean age (+/- standard deviation) was 31 (+/-5.8) years and median body mass index (interquartile range) was 30 (12) kg/m2. For 24% of women, PCOS diagnosis took >2 years and 39% saw three or more health professionals before diagnosis was made. The majority (60%) reported they were not given or referred to information sources at time of diagnosis, 20% reported receiving information and 20% were given information but felt it was inadequate. Of those who reported provision of information at diagnosis, 62% felt dissatisfied with or indifferent to information provided about PCOS, 79% reported being provided with information about lifestyle management, 89% reported being provided with information about medical therapy, 83% about long-term complications and 95% about potential infertility. Conclusions. PCOS diagnosis experience can be lengthy, involve many health professionals and leave unmet information needs. The current findings inform the need for evidence-based PCOS resources for women and health professionals.

N2  - Introduction: In the current study we aimed to determine body image, self-esteem and depressive symptomatology in women with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and compare with healthy controls. Method(s): This study was conducted among the patients with untreated PCOS who admitted to the Outpatient Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Faculty of Medicine of Selcuk University. A total 83 consecutive women with PCOS met the criteria of present study were included in the study. Age matched healthy controls (n=64) were recruited from employees at Selcuk University Hospital. PCOS was defined according to Rotterdam criteria. After socio-demographic characteristics of the participants were recorded, Body Image Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and Beck Depression Inventory were completed by the participants. Result(s): Patients with PCOS and healthy controls did not differ in some sociodemographic variables, including age, education and economic status (p>0.05). Previous psychiatric history was more prevalent among the PCOS group (p<0. 05).Body mass index (BMI) was <=25 kg/m2 in both groups. BMI values in the PCOS group were significantly higher than in the controls (p<0.05). BDI scores were significantly higher in the PCOS group compared to that in the healthy controls (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between the PCOS group and healthy controls in BIS and RSES scores (p>0.05). Conclusion(s): The present study suggests that PCOS seems to be associated with depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, rising BMI values of these women may be an indicator for the onset of PCOS. However, these results should be confirmed by prospective studies. Â© Archives of Neuropsychiatry.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. The aims of this study were to provide an estimate of the prevalence of PCOS in clinical practice; compare the risk of established cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease, and other comorbid conditions in women with PCOS to that of age- and race-matched controls; and explore the total costs of care that can be attributed to PCOS. Method(s): Louisiana Medicaid claims data were used to identify women with PCOS or its defining features and a control group in a ratio of 1:3. The prevalence of PCOS, cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, dyslipidemia, dysmetabolic syndrome, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and obesity), key comorbidities (anxiety, bipolar disorders, depression, eating disorders, infertility, obstructive sleep apnea), and diagnosed cardiovascular disease were measured. Result(s): During 2010, the prevalence of PCOS was 0.88%. Women with PCOS were more likely to have a diagnosis of diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 4.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.63Y5.21), dyslipidemia (OR, 3.56; 95% CI, 3.04Y4.19), dysmetabolic syndrome (OR, 23.46; 95% CI, 13.64Y40.36), glucose intolerance (OR, 5.46; 95% CI, 3.10Y9.60), hypertension (OR, 2.76; 95% CI, 2.41Y3.18), obesity (OR, 5.79; 95% CI, 5.07Y6.62), infertility (OR, 23.42; 95% CI, 10.63Y51.61), obstructive sleep apnea (OR, 6.47; 95% CI, 3.62Y11.55), anxiety (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.53Y2.04), bipolar disorders (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.55Y2.44), and depression (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.94Y2.54) than did controls. Average total costs of care for the year was $5551 in the PCOS group and $3496 in the control group. After controlling for the effects of other variables, the average total cost of care for PCOS was $637 higher than that of the control group. Other variables that contributed significantly to the total costs of care included race, age, acute myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, peripheral artery disease, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Conclusion(s): Although the clinical burden of PCOS is high, it is diagnosed less frequently in clinical practice compared with systematic screening studies. This is concerning considering that PCOS is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and other comorbidities. Mean total costs of care for the PCOS group was higher than the mean total costs of care for the control group. Polycystic ovary syndrome is independently associated with an increase in mean total costs of care. Copyright Â© 2014 by The American Federation for Medical Research.

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hyperandrogenic endocrine disorder which is also associated with psychological and metabolic disturbances. The aim of the present study was to determine whether depression and anxiety were more common in women with PCOS and whether were associated with metabolic and hormonal status. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 50 women with PCOS and 50 age-matched controls were eligible for the study. All participants completed standardized questionnaires assessing depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory). Hirsutism scores, hormonal and metabolic profile were also evaluated. Result(s): Depression and anxiety scores were found higher in women with PCOS compared to controls. Both scores were significantly correlated with body mass index, insulin resistance and lipid parameters as well as hirsutism scores. Conclusion(s): Data of the present study suggested that depression and anxiety scores were higher in women with PCOS compared to controls. Both depression and anxiety in PCOS is associated with obesity, hirsutism and metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hyperandrogenemia. Clinicians treating women with PCOS should be aware that these women are a high risk group for common mood and anxiety disorders. Management should focus on support, education and strongly emphasizing healthy lifestyle changes.Copyright Â© 2014 by Turkiye Klinikleri.

N2  - Purpose: The main goal of the current study was to examine the associations between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and body dissatisfaction and eating attitudes in a sample of adolescent girls and young women. Body dissatisfaction is 1 of the strongest predictors of the development of negative outcomes such as low self-esteem, and eating disorders. In adolescent age group of patients, both hirsutism and increased body mass index, appearing with PCOS, may be the leading symptoms also resulting or contributing to body dissatisfaction and eating disorder. Material(s) and Method(s): The sample of 94 Turkish adolescent girls and young women [PCOS (n = 42) vs non-PCOS (n = 52)] completed measures of figure rating scale, the socio-cultural attitudes toward appearance questionnaire, body esteem scale, eating attitude test, and demographics. Results and Conclusion(s): The results revealed that body esteem was important for predicting eating attitudes in both groups and sociocultural internalization of thinness ideal and body dissatisfaction were also significant factors in PCOS group. However, scores for major study variables (BMI, sociocultural attitudes toward awareness and internalized appearance ideals, body esteem subscales, body dissatisfaction and eating attitudes) in the PCOS group were not significantly higher than those for girls without PCOS.

N2  - This study was designed to determine the prevalence of bipolar disorder in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCO). One hundred and ten women with definite diagnosis of PCO and one hundred and ten age-matched infertile women due to other reasons except for PCO were enrolled in this casecontrol study. Ten ml fasting venous blood sample obtained to measure fasting glucose, LH and FSH. Height, weight and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were also recorded by an expert technician. A psychiatrist examined all 220 cases in order to determine the prevalence of depression and bipolarity. Mean age of each group participants were not significantly different while FBS, LH and LH/FSH levels were significantly higher in PCO patients. Eighty eight case were depressed in PCO group while 96 were depressed in control group (P=0.03). Bipolar disorder were higher in PCO group in comparison with controls (8 vs. 0, P=0.004). Psychiatric disorders should be considered in PCO women. Â© 2014 Tehran University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.

N2  - Psychiatric symptoms in women with polycystic ovary syndrome Objective: Most of the articles in the literature state that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is mostly accompanied by psychiatric diseases, and especially, depression and anxiety disorder are seen more frequently in cases of PCOS. With the increase in the level of testosterone in PCOS, many symptoms, such as hirsutism, menstrual irregularity, acne formation, infertility, and obesity appear. These complaints mostly cause negative affect, and the risk for psychiatric symptoms increases. In this study, we compared the level of psychiatric symptoms in women diagnosed with PCOS and healthy women, and investigated its relationship with gender orientation. Method(s): The study included 42 PCOS patients from Meram Medical School, and a group of 42 healthy women, without menstrual irregularity, acne formation and hirsutism who volunteered to participate in the study. Both groups were similar according to sociodemographic features. Both groups were administered a ociodemographic form prepared by the researchers as well as the Short Symptom Inventory and Bem Sex Role Inventory. Result(s): Depression, anxiety disorder, somatization, increased susceptibility in interpersonal relations, obsessive compulsive disorder, phobic anxiety, paranoid thoughts were more frequent in the PCOS group. On the other hand, the level of hostility and psychotic symptoms were similar in both groups. Conclusion(s): Psychiatric symptoms were more frequent in the PCOS group, which is consistent with the literature. It is expected that the life quality of PCOS patients will change positively if they are investigated more carefully in the obstetrics and gynecology outpatient clinics and directed to psychiatry outpatient clinics.

N2  - Introduction: In women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), changes in body appearance may influence the feminine identity of the patients with possible consequent depression and sexual dysfunction. Aim(s): The study aims to examine the differences in mood, perceived body image, sexual behavior, and clitoral vascularization between lean PCOS patients and healthy eumenorrheic controls. Method(s): Thirty-three lean PCOS women (Group I) and 22 healthy nonhirsute volunteers (Group II) were submitted, on day 3-5 of the cycle, to ultrasonographic (US) and Doppler analyses, to clinical, hormonal, and biochemical evaluations, and to psychometric tests. Main Outcomes Measures: Main outcome measures are Ferriman-Gallwey score (FG), clitoral volume, clitoral artery Pulsatility Index, the two-factor Italian McCoy female questionnaire (MFSQ), the Stunkard Figure Rating Scale (FRS), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaire. Result(s): The FG score and the androgens resulted, as expected, more elevated in PCOS patients than in controls. However, the US assessment of the clitoral body volume and the resistances registered at the level of the dorsal clitoral artery did not show any difference between Group I and Group II patients. Moreover, the two-factor Italian MFSQ, the FRS, and the BDI were similar in both groups. Conclusion(s): It seems that in lean PCOS women, the moderate hirsutism and hyperandrogenism do not have any important influence on body image and self-esteem and, as a consequence, on sexual function.

N2  - Introduction. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) appears to be related to sexual dysfunction, especially if associated with obesity. However, it is not clear whether obesity per se is an independent factor for sexual dysfunction. We hypothesized that obese polycystic ovary syndrome (OPCOS) patients have poorer sexual function than controls and nonobese polycystic ovary syndrome (NOPCOS) women. Aim. To assess the sexual function of women (either obese or nonobese) with PCOS compared to women with regular cycles. Main Outcome Measures. The main outcome measures were the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Free Androgen Index (FAI) values. Methods. We used a cross-sectional study design to evaluate 83 women, including 19 nonobese women without PCOS, 24 nonobese women with PCOS, 16 obese women without PCOS, and 24 obese women with PCOS. The FSFI questionnaire was used to gather data from all women, and free testosterone levels were determined and employed to calculate FAI values. Results. Higher androgen concentrations were evident in the PCOS groups compared to controls (NOC [nonobese control] 2.3+/-0.7; OC [obese control] 2.1+/-0.5; NOPCOS 3.1+/-0.8; OPCOS 3.5+/-1.2; P<0.0001). This was also true for FAI, with the exception of obese controls and nonobese women with PCOS, in whom the levels were similar (NOC 4.9+/-1.6; OC 6.5+/-3.1; NOPCOS 7.5+/-3.9; OPCOS 12.8+/-5.2; P<0.05). Evaluation of the total FSFI scores revealed that obese women without PCOS had below-normal sexual function scores, whereas both obese and nonobese women with PCOS had borderline scores compared to controls, who had normal FSFI findings. No association was observed between body mass index, the presence of PCOS, testosterone level, and FSFI score. Conclusions. The obese women in our sample were at a higher risk for sexual dysfunction and lower FSFI scores, and women with PCOS had borderline FSFI values, regardless of their obesity status. Based on this result, larger studies using the methods described in this pilot study are warranted to elucidate if obesity can impair sexual function in PCOS women.

N2  - Introduction. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disease and many symptoms are seen with varying degrees. The aim of the present study was to determine which symptoms increased such problems as depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and social worry by classifying PCOS according to symptoms. Methods. The study was carried out with two groups. The first group consisted of 86 patients who were diagnosed with PCOS and the second group consisted of 47 healthy volunteers. Liebowitz' Social Anxiety Scale, Rosenberg' Self-Esteem Scale, Short-Form 36, Quality of Life Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory were administered to each volunteer. Results. Depression scores of infertile group were higher while anxiety scores of the obese group were bigger than other groups. It was the obesity group that received the smallest score in self-esteem and trust in people and the highest score in sensitiveness to criticism. The most affected group was oligomenorrhea-hirsutism group in terms of physical functioning, physical role function, pain, social functioning, emotional role function, and emotional well-being. Conclusion. We suggest that not only gynecologist but also a multidisciplinary team may examine these patients. Â© 2013 Gokhan Acmaz et al.

N2  - Study Objective: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a major endocrine disorder afflicting women of reproductive age group. Women with PCOS suffer from depressive and anxiety disorders and they are more likely to be depressed compared to healthy women. However, no studies have assayed the perception of the clinical manifestations of PCOS in the adolescent group. In this study, we aimed at analyzing the anxiety, cognitive, and depressive states of adolescent girls with PCOS. Design(s): A total of 37 adolescents presenting to a tertiary care center in Lebanon and aged 14-18 years participated in the current study. Socio-economic and demographic data were collected and self-reported questionnaires (FSIQ, SDQ, SCARED, and BDI) were presented to the study group and analyzed. Result(s): The FSIQ levels among adolescents with PCOS were significantly lower compared to healthy controls. Surprisingly, there were no differences between the adolescent girls with PCOS and the healthy age-matched girls in the anxiety and depressive states and in psychiatric symptoms. Conclusion(s): This is the first study to assay for cognitive, anxiety, and depressive states in adolescent girls. No major differences were found among both groups except in cognitive levels. However, long-term follow-up for proper management of psychiatric disorders is warranted. Moreover, the latency of androgens and its contribution to psychiatric illnesses in women with PCOS could be a major factor for development of psychiatric symptoms, rather than the hyperandrogenic levels per se.

N2  - In this controlled study, we aimed to evaluate the sexual dysfunction of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in comparison to healthy controls. We enrolled 64 sexually active women in our study. The PCOS group consisted of 32 women who met the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria, and the control group was composed of 32 age-matched, healthy females. In addition to the demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants, the hormonal and biochemical parameters were also studied. All patients were invited to fill out the female sexual function index (FSFI) and Beck's Depression Inventory questionnaires. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction in the PCOS group was similar to controls (25% vs 19%; P=0.54). No significant difference was found according to each domain score of FSFI. Significant negative correlations were found between the total FSFI scores of the PCOS group and the total (r=-0.278) and free testosterone (r=-0.493) levels. Although depressive scores of PCOS patients were higher, they did not show greater impaired sexual functions than age-matched controls according to their FSFI scores. Considering the multifactorial state of female sexual dysfunction, further studies are needed to clarify the impact of PCOS upon sexuality. Â© 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

N2  - This retrospective evaluation of a web-based survey posted from 1 to 30 September 2010 was to determine which diagnostic tools physicians are currently utilizing to diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Responses from 262 IVF centres in 68 countries are included in the study. Providers used various diagnostic criteria to diagnose PCOS, including the Rotterdam criteria (82%), National Institutes of Health criteria (8%), Androgen Excess Society 2006 criteria (3%) and other classification systems (7%). Many providers utilized diagnostic tools not necessarily included in traditional classification systems: 58% of respondents evaluated LH/FSH ratio in addition to androgen concentrations to define patients with PCOS; physicians also commonly obtain measurement of anti-Mullerian hormone (22%) and impaired glucose tolerance (74%) in diagnosing PCOS. Many respondents (64%) felt that polycystic-appearing ovaries on ultrasound with anovulation and a normal serum prolactin should be adequate criteria to diagnose PCOS. In conclusion, while the majority of centres (82%) uses the Rotterdam criteria to diagnose PCOS, other criteria and diagnostic tools are commonly used in evaluating patients with suspected PCOS. This study highlights the need for continual re-evaluation of PCOS diagnostic criteria with an ultimate goal of developing a consensus definition for the disorder in the future.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is a common, chronic condition which affects women living with the condition both physically and psychologically. Social support may be beneficial to sufferers in coping with chronic conditions and the Internet is becoming a common place for accessing social support and information. The aim of this study was to consider the experiences of women living with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome who access and participate in an online support group discussion forum dedicated to issues surrounding this condition. Method(s): Fifty participants responded to a series of open-ended questions via an online survey. Result(s): Thematic analysis revealed a number of empowering and disempowering experiences associated with online support group participation. The empowering processes reported by members of the group included: Connecting with others who understand; Access to information and advice; Interaction with healthcare professionals; Treatment-related decision making; Improved adjustment and management. In terms disempowering processes, only two were described by group participants: Reading about the negative experiences of others and Feeling like an outsider. Conclusion(s): For women living with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, participation within an online support group may help to empower them in a range of important ways however, there may be some disempowering consequences.

N2  - Objective: The objective was to determine the current prevalence of Axis I and Axis II psychiatric diagnoses in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): The study sample included 73 patients with PCOS and 73 control subjects. Psychiatric disorders were determined by structured clinical interviews. Result(s): The rate of any Axis I psychiatric disorder (28.8% vs. 15.1%), social phobia (13.7% vs. 2.7%), generalized anxiety disorder (11.0% vs. 1.4%), any Axis II psychiatric disorder (23.3% vs. 9.6%) and avoidant personality disorder (12.3% vs. 1.4%) was significantly more common in the patient group compared to the control group.Of women with PCOS, 21 (28.8%) had at least one Axis I and 17 (23.3%) had at least one Axis II diagnosis. The most common Axis I disorder was social phobia (13.7%) and the most common Axis II disorder was avoidant personality disorder (12.3%) in women with PCOS. Social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and avoidant personality disorder were significantly more common in the patient group compared to the control group. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that a considerable proportion of women with PCOS also present with anxiety and personality disorders. Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Binge eating disorder(BED) is a newly established DSM V diagnosis present in 3.5 % of women and up to 30% of patients pursuing treatment for weight loss. This has not previously been assessed in infertility or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. We hypothesize a higher prevalence of BED in obese PCOS patients given the association of obesity with PCOS. DESIGN: Questionnaire-based observational study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An IRB approved 8 question survey utilizing DSM diagnostic criteria for BED designed to identify characteristic patterns of eating was administered to 3 groups of patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF): obese PCOS (BMI >30 kg/m2; n=6), lean PCOS (BMI<25 kg/m2; n=5), and controls (oocyte donors or male factor infertility (n=10). PCOS was diagnosed by Rotterdam criteria and BED was diagnosed by DSM criteria. Survey results were analyzed using one way ANOVAwith Tukey post hoc analysis. Demographic data was reported as mean+/- standard deviation. Significance was defined as p <0.05. RESULT(S): The mean age of patients was 29.7 +/- 3.0. The average BMI was 28.0 +/- 7.5. Average gravidity was 1.0+/-1.0. None of the patients were diagnosed with BED. However, the obese PCOS group was significantly more likely to response yes to 2 of 8 questions which were associated with eating when not hungry (p<0.01), and self- degradating emotions after over eating (p<0.01), compared to both lean PCOS and controls. CONCLUSION(S): While none of the patients in our study were diagnosed with BED, the greater number of positive responses among obese PCOS patients illustrates how eating without hunger can lead to emotional issues and poor self image that continues the overeating cycle. Further studies in obese PCO vs obese cycling patients need to be undertaken.

N2  - Introduction. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinologic disorder. Little is known about the effects of PCOS on overall sexual functioning, phases of the sexual response cycle, and sexual satisfaction. Aim. To compare the differences in sexual function between women with PCOS and controls, and to assess the relationship of serum testosterone, body mass index (BMI), hirsutism, and acne with sexual function scores in women with PCOS. Methods. A cross-sectional analysis in which women who met the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development criteria for PCOS were compared with a group of healthy volunteers. Main Outcome Measures. Results from the validated Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ) were used to assess sexual function. In women with PCOS, serum testosterone levels, BMI, self-reported hirsutism, and acne were assessed as independent variables. Results. Ninety-two women with PCOS and 82 controls were studied. Based on total CSFQ scores, sexual dysfunction was present in 27.2% of cases vs. 24.4% of controls (not signifcant). Women with PCOS had a significantly lower orgasm/completion score compared with women in the control group (P<0.001). Women with PCOS whose testosterone levels were>1 standard deviation above the mean had significantly better sexual functioning vs. those within 1 SD (P=0.015) and those>1 SD below the mean (P=0.033). In women with PCOS, increasing BMI was associated with a significant reduction in the orgasm/completion subdomain, but no significant associations were found in regard to acne or hirsutism. Conclusions. Women with PCOS have similar sexual functioning scores compared with controls except in regard to orgasm/completion. The subpopulation of women with PCOS whose serum testosterone levels are in the normal reproductive range are at increased risk for sexual dysfunction.

N2  - Background The aim of this study was to assess the psychological features in women with different polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes [National Institute of Health (NIH) and non-NIH diagnostic criteria] and women without PCOS. Methods An observational, cross-sectional study compared overweight (BMI <25 kg/m2) premenopausal women with PCOS (n 29 NIH and n 25 non-NIH) and controls (n 27). Anxiety and depression were compared between women with NIH or non-NIH PCOS and women without PCOS. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) domains related to emotions, body hair, weight, infertility and menstrual problems were compared between women with NIH and non-NIH PCOS. Results Overall, women with PCOS had worse anxiety (P 0.007) and depression (P 0.048) compared with women without PCOS. Both women with NIH PCOS and non-NIH PCOS presented more often with moderate anxiety (P 0.005 and P 0.01, respectively) compared with women without PCOS. Women with NIH PCOS had worse HRQoL related to infertility (P 0.012), emotions (P 0.02) and weight (P 0.016). No significant differences were observed between the two PCOS phenotypes for HRQoL domains related to body hair or menstrual problems. Both NIH (beta 0.30, P 0.024) and non-NIH (beta 0.32, P 0.016) PCOS status predicted anxiety, whereas age (beta 0.35, P 0.008) and free androgen index (beta 0.31, P 0.027) predicted depression. Conclusions PCOS is associated with anxiety and depression. Non-NIH phenotypes present with similar psychological profiles to NIH PCOS, indicating increased psychological dysfunction in PCOS, even in milder reproductive phenotypes. However, women with NIH PCOS appear to have worse HRQoL in some areas than women with non-NIH PCOS. Psychological function and HRQoL should be considered in all women with PCOS. Â© The Author 2012.

N2  - Objective Polycystic ovarian syndrome is one of the most frequent endocrine dysfunctions in women in their fertile age. To date, a clear definition of the disease remains controversial among experts, partly because study results concerning diagnostics and therapy are incoherent. In this survey, we intend to give an insight into the diagnostics and treatment regimes of PCOS in Germany and subsequently compare these results to the current recommendations found in international literature. Design In 2005, 7,000 outpatient gynecologists received a questionnaire with questions on PCOS definition, diagnostics and treatment. Results The survey shows that it remains difficult for gynecologists to restrict themselves to the few definition criteria defined in the 2003 Rotterdam PCOS Consensus Workshop. Nevertheless, therapy and diagnosis of PCOS show a uniform treatment pattern. The current recommendations found in international literature have been widely implemented into clinical practice. Modern therapeutic approaches such as the use of metformin are increasingly acknowledged. Conclusion Further studies dealing with the diagnosis and therapy of PCOS will be necessary in order to establish guidelines, especially when looking at patients without a desire for reproduction.

N2  - Study Objective: To evaluate the impact of a multidisciplinary clinic on weight management among adolescents with PCOS. Design(s): 140 adolescent females were evaluated in a multidisciplinary PCOS clinic from March 2005 to December 2008. The team included a pediatric endocrinologist, health psychologist, dietitian, and pediatric gynecologist. 110 were diagnosed with PCOS based on the Rotterdam Criteria. Height, weight, BMI, number of subspecialists seen, use of metformin, and compliance with return visits were obtained from medical records. Setting(s): American Family Children's Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. Participant(s): 110 adolescent females with polycystic ovary syndrome. Intervention(s): Consultation with a dietitian and health psychologist. Main Outcome Measure(s): Change in weight. Result(s): The average age at first visit was 15.9 years. The average BMI was 34.7 kg/m2 (range 18.1-55.5). Seventy-six percent had an initial BMI above the 95th percentile. Interactions with providers at the initial visit included a pediatric endocrinologist (100%), health psychologist (60.9%), dietitian (75.5%) and gynecologist (70.9%). Seventy one percent returned for a follow-up visit, (average time of 4.5 months between visits) with 57% achieving weight loss (average 3.5 kg) and an additional 12.6% demonstrating no significant weight gain (< 1.5 kg). Thus, 69.6% demonstrated weight loss/stabilization. Conclusion(s): In this multidisciplinary clinic for adolescents with PCOS, nearly 70% of patients succeeded in short-term weight stabilization, with 57% demonstrating weight loss. Interactions with the health psychologist and dietitian appeared to play a key role in successful weight control, supporting the importance of psychology and nutrition expertise in the management of this disorder.

N2  - Objectives: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders affecting women of fertile age. The aim was to study whether PCOS has an effect on sexual functioning. Study design: Women meeting the Rotterdam criteria for PCOS (n = 49), and 49 age-matched controls identified from the population registry, were recruited. Sexual functioning was assessed by means of (i) an in-person, structured interview covering various aspects of sexuality, and (ii) the nine-item McCoy questionnaire of female sexual satisfaction. Participants also completed the Psychological General Well-Being Index. Result(s): Almost half the women with PCOS reported that the disorder had a great impact on their sex life. Despite having the same number of partners and about the same frequency of sexual intercourse, women with PCOS were generally less satisfied with their sex lives compared to the population-based controls. Within the group of women with PCOS, high body mass index had only a minor effect on sexual functioning, while the total serum level of testosterone correlated positively to sexual satisfaction. PCOS women scored numerically lower than controls on the McCoy total score, but this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS reported decreased satisfaction with their sex life. Sexual function should be taken into account in treatment trials of PCOS, which traditionally target only symptoms related to insulin resistance, overweight, and hirsutism.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with psychological and metabolic disturbances. The aim of this study was to determine whether depression, anxiety and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are more common in women with PCOS and associated with metabolic risk. Method(s): The study included 226 PCOS patients and 85 BMI-matched healthy control women. All participants completed standardized questionnaires assessing depression (Beck Depression Inventory), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and both depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and General Health Questionnaire). Patients also completed a PCOS HRQOL questionnaire. Hirsutism scores, serum androgens and lipids were obtained. All subjects underwent a standard oral glucose tolerance test. Result(s): 28.6 of PCOS women versus 4.7 of control women had clinical depression scores indicating an 8.1-fold increased risk of depression in PCOS (P < 0.001). Depression and anxiety scores were higher in PCOS women than controls (P < 0.01 for all subscales). Obese PCOS subjects had higher depression scores and rates than non-obese PCOS women (P < 0.05). Depression scores were significantly correlated with insulin resistance and lipid parameters and with the number of components comprising the metabolic syndrome. Menstrual and hirsutism problems were the most serious concerns followed by emotional problems on the HRQOL. Conclusion(s): Depression and anxiety are more common in patients with PCOS compared with healthy women. Depression in PCOS might be associated with obesity and metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Â© 2011 The Author.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The impact of metabolic and reproductive features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compromises psychological functioning. We investigated factors associated with negative psychological functioning to determine whether they were predictive of anxiety and depression in PCOS. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed by questionnaire in 177 women with PCOS (mean +/- SD age 32.8 +/- 7.8 years) and 109 healthy controls (mean age 41.9 +/- 15.4 years). Main outcome measures were anxiety and depression, measured using the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ), respectively. Results Women with PCOS, compared with control women, had a higher mean anxiety HADS score (9.5 +/- 3.9 versus 6.5 +/- 3.6; P < 0.001), a higher mean depression score (5.7 +/- 3.7 versus 3.3 +/- 3.1; P < 0.001) and more negative body image in 7 out of 10 subscales of the MBSRQ. Multivariate regression analysis in PCOS showed that anxiety was predicted by self-worth (P < 0.0001), health evaluation (P = 0.005), time taken to diagnose PCOS (P = 0.003) and age (P = 0.02), while in control women, anxiety was predicted by self-worth (P = 0.009), health evaluation (P = 0.001) and rural living (P = 0.03). Depression in PCOS was predicted by self-worth (P = 0.0004), quality of life (QOL) (P = 0.004), fitness orientation (P = 0.002), appearance evaluation (P = 0.001) and time to diagnosis (P = 0.03) and in women without PCOS, by self-worth (P < 0.0001), QOL (P < 0.0001), illness orientation (P = 0.001) and appearance orientation (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Women with PCOS have increased anxiety, depression and negative body image compared with women without PCOS. In women with or without PCOS, body image and self-worth are predictors of both anxiety and depression, while QOL also predicts only depression. Time taken to diagnose PCOS is associated with poor psychological functioning. Â© The Author 2011.

T1  - Managing polycystic ovary syndrome: what our patients are telling us
A1  - Crete J.
A1  - Adamshick P. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) experience symptoms such as irregular menses, hirsutism, and acne, and are at heightened risk for developing obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, infertility, and some cancers. Data also indicate an inverse correlation between PCOS and health-related quality-of-life indicators and self-image. Purpose(s): The purpose of this study was to describe the lived experience of women with PCOS in the management of their disorder and the meaning of that experience for them. Design(s): This qualitative study was conducted using a phenomenological approach based on the guidelines of Van Manen. Method(s): Individual, semistructured interviews were completed with 10 participants who were diagnosed with PCOS and managed by a health care practitioner(s) within the past 5 years. Data were analyzed using the process of hermeneutic phenomenological reflection. Finding(s): The four major themes that described women's lived experience of managing PCOS were frustration, confusion, searching, and gaining control. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS face many challenges in managing their disorder and desire to gain control, balance, and well-being through a comprehensive treatment plan. The findings have implications for health care providers in addressing quality of life issues and overall health outcomes.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - To explore the psychosocial effects of living with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) through the experiences of young women diagnosed with this endocrine disorder. A qualitative, phenomenological methodology was used. Data were obtained through personal, semistructured interviews. College campuses in New England. A purposive sample of 12 young women with PCOS age 18 to 23 years. The following themes emerged from analysis of participants' responses: concerns for older self, feeling physically inferior, coping with symptoms, patient-provider relationship, seeking useable information and support, and coming to terms with a chronic condition. Participants in this study faced numerous physical, social, and emotional challenges on a daily basis. As these young women gathered information relevant to their needs, sought and received social support, and maintained their daily routines to improve their health and appearance, they came to terms with this chronic condition. Based on participants' relayed experiences, it became evident that a need exists for health care practitioners to include psychosocial support in a comprehensive holistic plan for the treatment of PCOS in adolescents and young women in their early twenties.

N2  - Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) have been found to suffer from fertility problems and mood dysfunction. To control for any effect of fertility problems, the present study compared mood dysfunction in women with PCOS to non-PCOS women with fertility problems. Seventy-six women with PCOS and 49 subfertile controls reported their anxiety, depression and aggression levels, and the relationship between mood and testosterone (T) was assessed. Controlling for age and BMI using MANCOVA, women with PCOS were significantly more neurotic (had difficulty coping with stress) than controls, had more anger symptoms, were significantly more likely to withhold feelings of anger and had more quality of life problems related to the symptoms of their condition (acne, hirsutism, menstrual problems and emotions). In a subgroup of 30 women matched on age, BMI and ethnicity, it was found that women with PCOS were significantly more anxious and depressed than controls. T was not generally correlated with mood states. This is the first study to identify problems with neuroticism and withholding anger in women with PCOS. These mood problems appear to be mainly attributable to PCOS symptoms, though other factors, such as hypoglycaemia, cannot be ruled out. Â© 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Objective: One publication reported that lower body satisfaction and lower education were independent predictors of depression in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women. This study replicates that analysis using different instruments, and adds androgen levels to the model. Method(s): Cross-sectional analysis of questionnaires (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report, Body Esteem Scale) and serum androgens from a community cohort with (n=94) and without (n=96) PCOS, matched by BMI category. Non-parametric tests, Spearman correlations, and negative binomial regression models were analyzed. Result(s): Depression symptoms were common (40-60% in lean, overweight and obese BMI categories) in the PCOS cohort, albeit generally of mild severity. The PCOS women had similar depression symptom severity (P. > .20) and similar body dissatisfaction (P. <= .25) as the regularly cycling women in total and stratified by BMI category. In both the PCOS and non-PCOS cohorts, depression symptom severity was positively correlated with dissatisfaction with physical appearance and physical conditioning (P. < .02). Body dissatisfaction (especially perception of physical conditioning) was strongly associated with more severe depression symptoms in non-obese PCOS women (BMI. < 30, P. < .04) before and after controlling for age, testosterone and free testosterone. In contrast, for obese women with PCOS, depression was unrelated to body dissatisfaction after controlling for age. Conclusion(s): Among non-obese PCOS women, their subjective body image was strongly associated with the severity of their depression symptoms. Most of the obese PCOS cohort had low body satisfaction and depression symptoms, therefore individual differences in the body dissatisfaction scores were not helpful in identifying depression symptom severity. Neither testosterone nor free testosterone was associated with depression symptom severity in PCOS women after controlling for body dissatisfaction and age. Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with symptoms that affect psychological wellbeing and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We wished to assess psychological distress and HRQoL among Sri Lankan women with PCOS. Design Case-control study. Setting Gampaha District, Sri Lanka. Population A total of 146 newly diagnosed women with PCOS, according to the Rotterdam criteria, and 170 age-matched controls recruited from community screening of 3030 eligible women between 15 and 39 years of age. Methods World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), validated for Sri Lankans with PCOS and a 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ30) were used to assess HRQoL and psychological distress, respectively. Main outcome measures Assessment of psychological distress, HRQoL and their correlates. Results The mean GHQ score was significantly higher (P < 0.001) among women with PCOS (5.25 +/- 6.25 SD) than among controls (1.58 +/- 1.46 SD), indicating greater psychological distress. Hirsutism in PCOS (defined as a Ferriman-Gallwey, FG, score <= 8) was significantly associated with psychological distress (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed the FG score as a significant predictor of psychological distress (P < 0.05). Mean scores for the physical, psychological and social relationships domains of the WHOQOL-BREF were significantly lower (P = 0.01) in women with PCOS than in controls, indicating poorer HRQoL. No significant predictors of HRQoL emerged from the multivariate analysis. Women with PCOS did not perceive excess body weight as a factor affecting their psychological wellbeing and HRQoL. Conclusions PCOS occurring in South Asians adversely affects their psychological wellbeing and HRQoL. Their psychological distress is related to hirsutism rather than to obesity, which affects white Europeans with PCOS. Â© RCOG 2010 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

N2  - Introduction.: Hyperandrogenism produces change in quality of life of women. Aim.: To prespectively determine the changes of the sexual behaviour of hyperandrogenic women using an oral contraceptive containing 30 mug ethinylestradiol and 2 mg chlormadinone acetate (EE/CMA). Methods.: Seventy-two volunteer women (age range, 18-32 years), with moderate to severe hirsutim and acne were treated with EE/CMA for 9 cycles. Main Outcomes Measure(s).: To assess hirsutism, the Ferriman-Gallwey (F-G) scoring system was used. Serum FSH, LH, estradiol, total and free testosterone, DHEAS, androstenedione, and SHBG levels were measured at baseline and at the 9th cycle of pill intake. The Short Personal Experience Questionnaire (SPEQ), the Short Form-36 (SF-36), and a visual analog scales questionnaires were used to assess the QoL, at baseline and after 3, 6 and 9 cycles of pill use. Result(s).: A reduction of 65% and 81% in the total mean F-G score was observed after the 6th cycle and the 9th cycle, respectively. The serum Androstenedione, and total and free testosterone levels decreased, and SHBG levels increased after the 9th cycle (p < 0.05). The SF-36 score was higher after 6 (p < 0.05) 9 cycles (p < 0.001) with respect to baseline. Frequency of sexual intercourse and of orgasm by intercourse increased, and the frequency of masturbation decreased during the 6th (p < 0.05) and the 9th cycle (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s).: The EE/CMA pill has anti-androgenic properties reducing the anti-aesthetic effect of hyperandrogenism and improving female sexual and social self-esteem.

N2  - Background: Anxiety and depression are more prevalent in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) than in those without this disorder. Possible confounding effects of overweight and obesity are suggested. The aim was to compare symptoms of anxiety and depression in women with PCOS and controls matched for age, body weight and body mass index (BMI). Method(s): Women with PCOS (n = 30) and controls (n = 30) were recruited from the community. Persons with ongoing psychotropic medication were excluded. All potential participants underwent gynecological examination to confirm case-control status. Participants completed the self-reported versions of the Brief Scale for Anxiety (BSA-S) and Montgomery sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S). Result(s): Women with PCOS had a higher BSA-S score compared with controls (median, range: 10.5, 1-24 versus 5.0, 0-28, P < 0.001). They scored higher on the following four individual symptoms: reduced sleep (2.0, 0-5 versus 0, 0-2, P < 0.001), worry (1.5, 0-4 versus 0, 0-6, P = 0.004), phobias (1, 0-4 versus 0, 0-3, P < 0.001), and pain (1, 0-3 versus 0, 0-2, P < 0.001). No statistical difference was demonstrated regarding MADRS-S scores (10.0, 0-27 versus 5.5, 0-24, P = 0.053). Only one of the nine MADRS-S symptoms, reduced sleep, which is also included in the BSA-S, differed between cases and controls. Conclusion(s): Several anxiety symptoms distinguished women with PCOS from a control group matched on BMI. A better understanding of the symptoms is needed to identify and alleviate anxiety symptoms in this vulnerable group.

N2  - Objectives: Polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS is one of the most common reproductive abnormalities and is characterized by hyperandrogenemia. We aimed to assess the frequency of fibromyalgia syndrome FMS and psychological distress in patients with PCOS. Method(s): Forty patients with PCOS and 39 age-matched healthy controls were included in the study as PCOS and healthy normal control HNC groups. The diagnosis of FMS was based on the American College of Rheumatology criteria of 1990, and the diagnosis of PCOS was based on the Rotterdam criteria of 2003. All participants completed the questionnaires to gather information including demographic features, FMS-related symptoms, and the psychological status. Patients with PCOS were divided into two subgroups according to coexistence of FMS PCOS only and PCOS FMS. Result(s): The mean age of PCOS and HNC groups were 23.97 +/- 6.01 and 26.15 +/- 5.45 years, respectively P > 0.05. The frequency of FMS in PCOS and HNC groups was 32.5 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively P < 0.05. Except constipation and paresthesia, the presence of FMS-related symptoms in the PCOS FMS subgroup were higher than those of the PCOS only subgroup and HNC group. There were no differences in depression scores between the PCOS only and PCOS FMS subgroups, but there were differences in anxiety scores. Conclusion(s): The frequency of FMS was found to be increased in PCOS. Anxiety risk was also found to be increased, particularly in patients with PCOS and concomitant FMS.

N2  - Aim.To assess psychological features in young women with and without PCOS. Methods.Observational, cross-sectional pilot study in young women aged 1825 with (n=24) or without (n=22) PCOS (age: 22.41+/-0.39 vs. 21.95+/-0.47 years, p=0.46; BMI: 29.17+/-1.54 vs. 22.05+/-0.83kg/m2, p=0.0003). The main outcome measures were quality of life, anxiety, depression, risk perception and fears on future health. Results.Women with PCOS demonstrated worsened quality of life (p=0.033) and greater anxiety (p=0.01) and depression (p=0.023) than women without PCOS related to BMI status. Women with PCOS were more likely to perceive themselves as at risk of obesity (p=0.012) and infertility (p<0.0001), and perceived greater importance in reducing future risk of prediabetes (p=0.027), gestational diabetes (p=0.039), type 2 diabetes (p=0.01), heart disease (p0.005), obesity (p0.0007) and infertility (p=0.023) than women without PCOS. Women with PCOS were more likely to have fears about future health related to weight gain (p=0.045), loss of femininity (p=0.035), loss of sexuality (p=0.003) and infertility (p=0.019) than women without PCOS. Conclusions.Worsened quality of life, anxiety and depression in young women with PCOS is related to BMI. Risk perception is appropriately high in PCOS, yet perceived risks of future metabolic complications are less common than those related to weight gain and infertility.

N2  - Objective: To characterize patients referred to the adolescent polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) clinic at the American Family Children's Hospital, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin. Design(s): Chart review of patients seen in the first 33 months for details of initial presentation, age, body mass index (BMI), menstrual pattern, clinical and laboratory features of androgen excess, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Setting(s): Multidisciplinary clinic for adolescents with PCOS at the American Family Children's Hospital, Madison, Wisconsin. Participant(s): Adolescent girls with PCOS. Result(s): Seventy patients (84% Caucasian) presented with an average age at referral of 16.2 years (range 11-22 y). Eighty four percent had a BMI > the 85th percentile and 70% had a BMI > 95th percentile. Menstrual pattern was quite varied, with some patients having primary amenorrhea, and over 50% experiencing hirsutism. There were 3 cases of type 2 diabetes, and over half of the patients had elevated fasting insulin levels and low HDL levels. Conclusion(s): Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a complex and heterogeneous disorder that requires multidisciplinary expertise. Knowing the unique features of the adolescent with PCOS and metabolic risks should permit earlier intervention with intensive counseling and medical therapy to address current health concerns and prevent future co-morbidities.

N2  - Purpose. The purpose of this study was to assess self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and those with the rare Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser Syndrome (MRKHS), compared with healthy adolescents. Material and methods. The participants were 49 adolescent girls, of whom 27 were patients with confirmed menstrual disorder, 22 with PCOS and 5 with MRKHS; and 22 were healthy eumenorrheic adolescents (control group) matched by age and school grade. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Gr) were used to measure depression and anxiety, respectively. Results. The results showed that it was 1.08 times more likely for the PCOS group (p=0.043) and 1.12 times more likely for the MRKHS group (p=0.039) to have higher scores than healthy adolescents on the anxiety scale. The MRKHS group was 1.40 times more likely to have a higher number of depressive symptoms (p=0.040) than the control group. Conclusions. These findings, although based on a small sample, suggest a relationship between PCOS and MRKHS and the presence of psychological problems, such as anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents. This study is among the first to examine psychological difficulties in adolescents with such a rare menstrual syndrome as MRKHS.

N2  - Background: We analyzed the neuroendocrine and immune cell responses to psychosocial stress in PCOS patients compared to BMI-matched healthy controls. Method(s): Responses to public speaking stress were analyzed in 32 PCOS patients and 32 BMI-matched healthy controls. At baseline, during, and 10- and 45-min after stress, state anxiety, cardiovascular responses, cortisol, ACTH, as well as circulating leukocyte subpopulations were analyzed, together with hsCRP and serum IL-6 concentrations. Result(s): In response to public speaking stress, both groups showed significant but comparable increases in state anxiety, and blood pressure (all p < 0.001; time effects). The ACTH and cortisol stress responses were significantly enhanced in PCOS (both p < 0.05; interaction effect). In addition, heart rate was significantly higher in PCOS (p < 0.05; group effect). PCOS patients displayed a reduced upregulation of IL-6 levels in response to stress (p < 0.05; interaction effect). Baseline levels of circulating leukocyte subpopulations, IL-6 and hsCRP concentrations did not differ between BMI-matched controls and PCOS patients. PCOS patients were characterized by markedly increased psychological distress. Conclusion(s): PCOS patients showed enhanced HPA-axis and heart rate reactivity as well as a reduced upregulation of IL-6 in response to stress. The altered stress reactivity in PCOS patients may constitute a link between depression, overweight, and the cardiovascular and diabetes risks associated with the diagnosis. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Introduction. In polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) women, the changes in body appearance (mainly obesity and hirsutism) may influence the feminine identity of the patients with consequent depression and sexual disturbances. Aim. To evaluate if lean PCOS patients present an increased incidence of depression and sexual dysfunction in comparison with controls and if clitoral volume and vascularization are influenced by circulating androgens levels. Methods. 25 lean PCOS women (Group I) and 18 healthy nonhirsute volunteers (Group II) were submitted, on day 3-5 of the cycle, to ultrasonographic and Doppler analyses, and to hormonal and biochemical evaluations. Main Outcome Measures. Utero-ovarian and clitoral ultrasonographic analysis, and color Doppler evaluation of the uterine, stromal ovarian, and dorsal clitoral arteries. Hormonal and nitrites/nitrates plasma concentrations were analyzed. Each woman filled in the 2-factor Italian McCoy female questionnaire (MFSQ) and the Beck's Depression Inventory questionnaire (BDI). Results. Androgens resulted, as expected, more elevated in PCOS patients than in controls. However, the ultrasonographic (US) assessment of the clitoral body volume evidenced no significant differences between PCOS (0.72 +/- 0.41 mL) and control (0.62 +/- 0.20 mL) patients. The resistances registered at the level of the dorsal clitoral artery did not show any difference between Group I (PI = 1.55 +/- 0.40) and Group II (PI = 1.79 +/- 0.38). The 2-factor Italian MFSQ and the BDI did not show any difference between PCOS women and controls. Conclusions. In PCOS women, probably, the moderate hirsutism and hyperandrogenism do not induce the sense of loss of feminine identity and have no impact on sexual self-worth and sexual satisfaction.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), one of the main features is chronic anovulation associated with lower pregnancy rates. Little is known regarding the psychological aspects associated with infertility in these patients. Therefore, we examined the influence of an unfulfilled wish to conceive on various aspects of psychological functioning in PCOS women. METHOD(S): Standardized questionnaires assessing quality-of-life (36-item short-form health survey, SF-36), depressiveness (Beck Depression Inventory), emotional distress (Symptom Check List 90, SCL-90-R), sexual satisfaction and self-worth (visual analogue scales), and a questionnaire on the desire for a child (FKW) were administered at the outpatient endocrine clinic to consecutive PCOS patients. RESULT(S): Questionnaires from 115 PCOS patients were analysed. The majority (76.1%) worried about remaining childless in the future, and 51.3% reported a current wish to conceive. 23.9% of patients had scores indicating mild to moderate depression, and 25.2% had scores indicating clinically relevant depression. Furthermore, all quality-of-life scores were significantly lower compared with normative data (P < 0.001). Unexpectedly, comparisons of patients with a current unfulfilled desire to conceive to those with no present wish for a child revealed no discernable impact on depressive symptoms, quality-of-life or emotional distress. Reduced sexual satisfaction and self-worth were largely determined by partnership status and not infertility. However for PCOS patients who wished to conceive, the wish for a child was a significantly greater priority when compared with normative data from infertile patients. CONCLUSION(S): PCOS represents a major risk factor for psychosocial and emotional problems, but at least in this sample of PCOS patients, infertility does not appear to constitute a primary determinant of psychological problems.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome affects 5-10% of women in the developed world, making it the most common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age. The symptoms typically associated with polycystic ovary syndrome: amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, obesity, subfertility, anovulation and acne can lead to a significant reduction in female life quality. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of polycystic ovary syndrome on quality of life and marital sexual satisfaction. Fifty women with polycystic ovary syndrome were qualified to the study as the research group. The control group consisted of fourty healthy women. A specific questionnaire was used as a research tool in this study. It included the socio-demographic part, polycystic ovary syndrome's symptomatology and validated scales: Polish version of Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) and Index of Sexual Satisfaction (ISS). The mean age of researched women was 28.9+/-5.6 years, and in the control group - 30.5+/-5.3 years (p>0.05). Quality of life parameters for women with polycystic ovary syndrome were lower than for the controls in the aspect of: general health (p<0.01), limitations due to physical health (p<0.05), limitations due to emotional problems (p<0.001), social functioning (p<0.01), energy/fatigue (p<0.001) and emotional well-being (p<0.01). Studied women showed worse marital sexual functioning (p<0.05). Marital sexual dysfunctions were diagnosed in 28.6% of women with polycystic ovary syndrome and in 10.5% of healthy women (p<0.05). Polycystic ovary syndrome decreases quality of life and marital sexual functioning among women. A negative effect of hirsutism severity on general well-being and marital sexual life is also observed.

N2  - The relationship between clinico-biochemical characteristics and self-reported psychological parameters in 42 women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and 42 age-matched healthy controls was examined. The General Health Questionnaire was used (GHQ-12) to ascertain emotional distress and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to determine depressive symptoms. Emotional distress, depressive symptoms, hirsutism score, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), luteinizing hormone/ follicle-stimulating hormone ratio, serum total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels and the insulin resistance index were significantly greater in women with PCOS than in healthy women. The BDI and GHQ-12 scores of the women with PCOS were significantly higher than those of the control group (BDI, 11.69 +/- 9.49 vs 5.80 +/- 4.58; GHQ-12, 3.38 +/- 3.38 vs 1.54 +/- 1.97, respectively), and BMI and WHR were positively correlated with the BDI and GHQ-12 scores. Clinicians should be aware of the increased risk of emotional distress and depression in women with PCOS, especially those who are obese, and of the need to screen these patients for such symptoms.

T1  - The information needs of women diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome - Implications for treatment and health outcomes
A1  - Avery J.C.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Background: This paper reports the findings of an exploratory study about the information women diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) want to know about their condition and the consequences of this information for future treatment and health outcomes. Method(s): In-depth qualitative interviews regarding their information needs were undertaken with ten South Australian women diagnosed with PCOS. These women were aged 28-38 years and at differing stages of their fertility experience. The time since diagnosis ranged from 1-17 years. The main outcome measures sought were the identification of the information needs of women diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) during different periods of their lives; how and where they obtain this information, and the consequences of this information for future treatment and health outcomes. Result(s): The women with PCOS in this study preferentially used the Internet for their information needs, as it had the advantages of convenience, privacy and accessibility, when compared with traditional mechanisms of information provision. Conclusion(s): Giving a name to a collection of symptoms may bring relief and provide recognition that there really is a problem. However, with a diagnosis comes the need to have questions answered. A diagnosis of a chronic condition such as PCOS necessitates decision-making regarding possible treatment strategies and lifestyle choices. Information is needed in order to participate in shared decision making. The Internet proved to be a most versatile and beneficial source of information source for women with PCOS, if its limitations are taken into consideration.

N2  - Background and objective: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) present with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular diseases at a young age, including obesity and chronic low-grade inflammation. Since depression is common in PCOS, this study aimed to address whether depression correlates with indices of chronic low-grade inflammation beyond the association with obesity. Method(s): Serum concentrations of IL-6, the stimulated production of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10, leukocyte numbers, and hsCRP were analyzed in 57 PCOS patients and 28 healthy women, together with clinical parameters, including body mass index (BMI), testosterone, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and psychological parameters, including Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and health-related quality-of-life (SF-36) scores. Result(s): PCOS patients demonstrated significantly increased hsCRP, IL-6, and leukocyte numbers. Group differences in IL-6 and leukocyte numbers, but not hsCRP, disappeared after controlling for BMI. The stimulated production of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5 was significantly decreased, irrespective of BMI. In PCOS, hsCRP, IL-6, and leukocyte numbers were correlated with BMI, HDL, diastolic blood pressure, and with insulin resistance. On the other hand, no correlations were found with depression scores or with PCOS-specific endocrine abnormalities. In regression models, BMI was a significant predictor of the key immune markers, and explained a large amount of variance, whereas BDI was not included in either model. Conclusion(s): These data confirm that obesity plays a pivotal role in inflammatory processes relevant to cardiovascular risk in women with PCOS. However, even lean PCOS patients may display subtle alterations in specific aspects of immunity. Our findings did not support a correlation of depression with chronic low-grade inflammation in PCOS.

N2  - Objectives. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hyperandrogenemia and androgen levels are associated with muscle size and strength; thus we aimed to investigate the hand functions of women with PCOS. Methods. Thirty-seven patients with PCOS and 35 age-matched healthy women were included in the study as PCOS and control groups. Age, body mass index, dominant hand, physical activity level, lean/fat mass ratio, percentage of body fat, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score and Duruoz Hand Index (DHI) score were recorded. Hand grip and pinch strengths were tested in the dominant hand using a hand dynamometer and a pinch meter, respectively. Manuel dexterity was tested by the grooved pegboard test. Serum concentrations of total testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone and progesterone were measured. Results. Patients with PCOS had high total testosterone levels (p < 0.001). There were no differences between groups in all of the hand strengths or dexterity. No correlations between hand parameters and hormones were found. DHI and BDI scores were high in the PCOS group (p = 0.002 and 0.039, respectively). There was a correlation between DHI and BDI scores. Depressive patients had higher BMI (p = 0.021) and body fat percentage (p = 0.05) than non-depressive patients in the PCOS group. Conclusion. Hand strength and dexterity did not change in patients with PCOS. Depression risk increased especially in the patients with high BMI and affected hand functional status in PCOS.

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hyperandrogenic endocrine disorder affecting women of fertile age. The aim of this study was to survey whether the rate of clinical psychiatric disorders in PCOS differs from the normal population. Method(s): Women with PCOS (n = 49) meeting the Rotterdam criteria for PCOS, and 49 age-matched controls identified from the population registry, were recruited. Trained clinicians used the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview to establish lifetime occurrence of Axis I DSM diagnoses. Serum-testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin were analyzed. Result(s): Women with PCOS had higher lifetime incidence of depressive episodes, social phobia, and eating disorders than controls. Suicide attempts were seven times more common in the PCOS group than in the controls. Current as well as lifetime use of antidepressants and anxiolytic drugs were more common in the PCOS group. Conclusion(s): Previous studies have found that PCOS is associated with decreased quality of life and self-rated mental symptoms. This study demonstrates that PCOS is also linked to psychiatric syndromes as verified by structured clinical assessments. The clinical implication of this study is that clinicians treating women with PCOS should be aware that these women are a high risk group for common affective and anxiety disorders as well as suicide attempts.

T1  - Implementation of dietary and general lifestyle advice among women with polycystic ovarian syndrome
A1  - Humphreys L.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Aims: Central obesity and insulin resistance are strongly implicated in the etiology of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and their reduction is therefore a central treatment focus. Weight loss has been consistently successful in reducing insulin resistance and restoring ovulation and fertility in women with PCOS. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the general attitudes towards dieting and exercise in women with PCOS, together with the extent of implementation of the dietary and lifestyle advice that these women are given as part of their treatment. General knowledge of patients about their condition (PCOS) has also been assessed. Method(s): Fifty three pre-menopausal women, over the age of 18 years, with a confirmed diagnosis of PCOS, were recruited from the Endocrinology Department, Middlesex Hospital, London. Subjects were interviewed individually using an interview-guided questionnaire. Result(s): Sixty four per cent of the subjects were overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2) and 55% of those were obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2). All subjects identified the importance of weight control in the management of their condition. However, only nine out of the 35 overweight women had actually been referred to a dietician and only 22 reported taking moderate exercise at least once a week in order to improve their health. The main sources of information on weight management were the internet and their consultant endocrinologist, who they normally see only twice a year. Conclusion(s): In spite of the fact that weight loss and weight maintenance are absolutely vital in the treatment of PCOS, our study has shown that the support given to PCOS patients to help reduce and control their weight is inadequate and needs to be improved.

N2  - Objective: In this study, we compared healthy women with women having polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) for the levels of depression, anxiety, and ways of coping skills. Material(s) and Method(s): A cross-sectional study was designed. We examined 35 women with PCOS and 35 healthy women between January 2006 and January 2007. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Ways of Coping Inventory (WCI) were used for psychological assessment. Result(s): Women with PCOS had significantly higher scores on the BDI and STAI. Among the subtests of WCI, both helplessness and self-blaming and accepting responsibility subscales of the PCOS patients were significantly higher than those of the control group. Discussion(s): Our results indicated that there could be an association between psychosocial characters of the individual and PCOS. Further studies are needed to characterize this association.

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with several metabolic complications. A few small studies have also suggested an increased risk of depression in women with PCOS. The goals of this study were to estimate the prevalence of depressive disorders in women with PCOS compared with controls and to evaluate the correlation between depression, hyperandrogenism, and other metabolic markers. Design(s): Cohort study. Setting(s): University Hospital. Patient(s): Women with PCOS (Rotterdam criteria; n = 103). Women without PCOS seen during the same time period for an annual exam were used as control subjects (n = 103). Intervention(s): Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire (PRIME-MD PHQ) and the Beck Depression Inventory. Main Outcome Measure(s): Depressive disorders. Result(s): Women with PCOS were at an increased risk for depressive disorders (new cases) compared with controls (21% vs. 3%; odds ratio 5.11 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-20.69]; P<.03). The overall risk of depressive disorders in women with PCOS was 4.23 (95% CI 1.49-11.98; P<.01) independent of obesity and infertility. Compared with the nondepressed PCOS subjects, the depressed PCOS subjects had a higher body mass index (BMI) and evidence of insulin resistance (P<.02). Conclusion(s): We report a significantly increased risk of depressive disorders (as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV) in women with PCOS and recommend routine screening in this population.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has clinical features and implications for long-term health that may lead to decreased quality of life (QoL) and psychological morbidity. We studied QoL in women with PCOS, compared the findings with population norms and assessed whether they correlated with reported quality of patient information received. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Patient(s): Women with PCOS by National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, diagnosis confirmed by one endocrinologist. Measurements: Four questionnaires were mailed: the Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Quality-of-Life Questionnaire for Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOSQ), the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) and an assessment of information quality and sources, the Patient Information Questionnaire (PIQ). Result(s): Questionnaires were sent to 443 women with PCOS from one endocrinologist's database; 203 women aged 15-65 years agreed to participate. To compare with Australian population norms, data from those women aged 18-44 years (n = 173) were used. Of these, 64% were obese, 18% overweight and 18% of normal weight. The demographics, socioeconomic status and untreated biochemistry of the responders and the total patient group were not significantly different. SF-36 scores were significantly lower than the age- and sex-matched Australian population (P < 0.01), including the overweight subset (P < 0.01). Health-related QoL by PCOSQ was similar to other published studies. GHQ-28 identified psychological morbidity in 62.4%, compared with 26.4% in a matched Australian population (P < 0.0001). Body mass index (BMI) was negatively correlated with QoL (P < 0.01). There was a positive association between the psychological domain of QoL and the subjective assessment of the quality of health-related information in general (P < 0.001), for hirsutism (P < 0.01) and for menstrual irregularity (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): We have shown impaired QoL and increased prevalence of psychological morbidity in PCOS compared with population norms. The perception of inadequate information about the condition correlated with poorer QoL scores. Improved information delivery may lead to an improvement in QoL and needs to be tested with an intervention study. Â© 2007 The Authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To uncover the meaning of living with polycystic ovary syndrome. DESIGN: Phenomenology. SETTING: A women's health care practice in northeast United States. PARTICIPANTS: A purposive sample consisting of 12 women, ages 21 to 48 years, who had been previously diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome. DATA COLLECTION: Semistructured interviews. RESULT(S): Analysis of the participants' responses revealed the following themes: (a) identifying differences, (b) wanting to be normal, (c) searching for answers, (d) gaining control, (e) attempting to achieve femininity, (f) letting go of guilt, and (g) dealing with it. CONCLUSION(S): Polycystic ovary syndrome is a syndrome that impacts women both physically and psychosocially. Nurses can play a key role in assisting women afflicted with this hormonal disturbance through education and support.

T1  - Depression and body image among women with polycystic ovary syndrome
A1  - Himelein M.J.
A1  - Thatcher S.S. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Common features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), including hyperandrogenism, ovarian dysfunction and obesity, can be highly distressing. We compared 40 women with PCOS to women with infertility but not PCOS, and to women with neither PCOS nor infertility, on measures of depression and body image. Women with PCOS reported higher depression scores and greater body dissatisfaction (p < .001) than comparison group women. Body image was strongly associated with depression overall, even after controlling body mass. Among women with PCOS, body dissatisfaction measures and education explained 66 percent of the variance in depression, suggesting explanations of the PCOS-depression link should consider the role of potentially mediating psychosocial variables.

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been shown to cause a reduction in quality of life. This study examines the extent of different PCOS symptoms on quality-of-life, psychosocial well-being and sexual satisfaction. Method(s): Complete metabolic, hormonal, clinical and psychosocial data were obtained from a total of 120 women with PCOS. Patients were compared with 50 healthy women to establish reductions in quality-of-life and emotional well-being. In addition, the correlation between psychosocial variables and the major clinical PCOS features obesity (body mass index (BMI)), excessive body hair (hirsutism score), acne, hyperandrogenism (serum testosterone levels), disturbed insulin regulation (area under the insulin response curve and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), menstrual cycle disturbances and infertility were analyzed. Result(s): PCOS patients showed significant reductions in quality-of-life, increased psychological disturbances, and decreased sexual satisfaction when compared with healthy controls. BMI and hirsutism scores, but not the presence of acne, were associated with physical aspects of quality-of-life and sexual satisfaction. No clear effect of androgens or insulin resistance on psychosocial variables was detected. Similarly, the type of menstrual cycle disturbances or infertility had no impact on psychological well-being. Conclusion(s): In PCOS, changes in appearance, particularly obesity and hirsutism, reduce physical dimensions of quality-of-life and decrease sexual satisfaction. The role of biochemical, endocrine and metabolic parameters as well as menstrual irregularities and infertility appeared to be less important. Clinicians should pay attention to the psychosocial dimensions of PCOS on an individual basis, regardless of symptom severity or treatment response.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Objective: Our understanding of the organizational and activational effects of human gonadal hormones on behavior has depended on the study of endocrine disorders. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder that begins in puberty and is characterized by chronically augmented free testosterone (FT) levels. The purposes of this study were 1) to compare negative mood states of women with PCOS to those of women with normal hormonal levels and 2) to examine the relationship between negative moods and androgens. Method(s): Twenty-seven women with PCOS were case-matched to 27 normal menstruating women on body mass index since being overweight is a common symptom of PCOS and could affect mood states. Serum levels of FT, total testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, estradiol, and progesterone were determined. Self-reported depression, anger, anxiety, and aggression were analyzed between groups, and individual scores were compared across groups to hormone values. Result(s): Depression was significantly increased in the PCOS group and remained so after considering the variance related to physical symptomatology and other mood states. Furthermore, a curvilinear relationship between FT and negative affect across groups was suggested: the most elevated negative mood-scale scores were associated with FT values just beyond the upper limits of normal, while lower negative mood levels corresponded to both normal and extremely high values of FT. Conclusion(s): These results are consistent with a model of activational influences of testosterone on adult female behavior. Implications are discussed for future research and for treatment of PCOS and other menstrual-cycle mood disorders.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder characterized by chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism. PCOS is one of the leading causes of infertility and manifests with hirsutism, acne, and obesity. To investigate its impact on health-related quality of life and sexuality, 50 women with PCOS and 50 controls were evaluated with standardized questionnaires (36-item short-form health survey, symptom checklist revised, and life satisfaction questionnaire). The impact of hirsutism, obesity, and infertility was assessed using five-point rating scales, and sexual satisfaction was analyzed with visual analog scales. Patients showed greater psychological disturbances on the symptom checklist revised dimensions, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, aggression, and psychoticism, along with a lower degree of life satisfaction in the life satisfaction questionnaire scales health, self, and sex. Health-related quality of life measured with the 36-item short-form health survey revealed significantly decreased scores for physical role function, bodily pain, vitality, social function, emotional role function, and mental health in patients with PCOS. Although patients had the same partner status and frequency of sexual intercourse, they were significantly less satisfied with their sex life and found themselves less attractive. Most of the differences were not affected by correction for body weight. In conclusion, PCOS causes a major reduction in the quality of life and severely limits sexual satisfaction.

N2  - Objective: To examine the fertility concerns and sexual behavior of adolescent girls with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as compared to healthy adolescent girls and the effect of these concerns on health-related quality of life. Design and Setting: A cross-sectional study of adolescent girls with PCOS (n = 97) and healthy comparisons (n = 186) was conducted at an urban, hospital-based adolescent medicine practice. Participants completed the Child Health Questionnaire Version CF-87 as a measure of health-related quality of life and a general health history questionnaire that included items regarding sexual activity, contraception, fertility concerns, and severity of illness. Findings were evaluated using multivariate logistic and linear regression models. Result(s): Healthy subjects were 2.8 times more likely to have had sexual intercourse than PCOS participants, though the mean age at initiation of sexual intercourse among sexually active girls was not significantly different between the two groups. Severity of illness and the worry about fertility were not associated with odds of being sexually active, Girls with PCOS were 3.4 times more likely to be worried about their ability to become pregnant than comparisons and concern about future fertility was associated with significant reductions in quality of life, Conclusion(s): Adolescents with PCOS are more concerned about fertility than their healthy peers and this concern may affect their overall quality of life. The finding that more than a third of the adolescents with PCOS in this study were sexually active underscores the importance of providing ongoing counseling on fertility issues, contraception, and STD prevention in the care of adolescent girls with PCOS.

N2  - Objectives: To examine health-related quality of life (HRQL) in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), compared with healthy adolescents, and to determine whether clinically observed or self-perceived severity of illness affects their HRQL. Design and Setting: Cross-sectional study of female adolescents conducted at an urban, hospital-based adolescent medicine clinical practice. Participant(s): Ninety-seven adolescent patients with PCOS and 186 healthy patients who were seen for care between October 15, 1999, and March 2, 2001. Main Outcome Measure(s): Health-related quality-of- life scores as determined by the Child Health Questionnaire-Child Self-Report Form. Result(s): Adolescents with PCOS scored lower on subscales measuring general health perceptions, physical functioning, general behavior, and limitations in family activities because of illness. Patients scored higher on the change in health in the last year subscale, and most had been diagnosed and initiated treatment for PCOS in the last year. Patients who had higher self-perceived severity of illness also scored lower on the general health perceptions subscale, but clinical severity was not associated with differences in HRQL. Conclusion(s): Adolescents with PCOS experience lower HRQL compared with healthy adolescents. Polycystic ovary syndrome and perceived severity of illness negatively affect HRQL in adolescents. This study suggests a need to develop interventions to reduce the distress that patients with PCOS may face as adolescents and young adults.

T1  - 'The thief of womanhood': Women's experience of polycystic ovarian syndrome
A1  - Kitzinger C.
A1  - Willmott J. 
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Previous research on polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has overwhelmingly been conducted within a medical or psychiatric framework, and has failed to explore women's own experience of the syndrome. Interviews were conducted with 30 women with PCOS recruited through a national self-help organisation. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed pervasive reports of feeling 'freakish', 'abnormal', and not 'proper' women. These feelings were related to three symptoms commonly experienced by women with PCOS: 'excess' hair growth; irregular, absent or disrupted periods; and infertility. Smooth hairless bodies and faces, regular menstruation and the capacity to bear children were associated with femininity, and as a result of their symptoms women expressed feeling 'different' from other women and less 'feminine'. The results are discussed within a feminist framework and suggest that polycystic ovarian syndrome is a deeply stigmatising condition, 'a theft of womanhood', with far reaching implications for all women, whether or not they conform to 'feminine' norms.

N2  - Background: This investigation was undertaken to describe patient perception and awareness of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common cause of anovulation/oligoovulation among women of reproductive age. Method(s): Fifteen parameters were evaluated by a computer-based research instrument accessed by a large, unscreened population. Incomplete questionnaires were not entered, and responses were electronically tabulated to block duplicate submissions. Result(s): From 657 participants, the majority (63%) were between 26-34 years old; mean BMI was 30.4 kg/m2. 343 of 657 had at least one pregnancy and 61% of the study group had taken fertility medicine (any type) at least once. Physicians were the most common provider of PCOS information for all study participants, irrespective of age. Patient emotions associated with the diagnosis of PCOS included "frustration" (67%), "anxiety" (16%), "sadness" (10%), and " indifference" (2%). Self-reported patient aptitude regarding PCOS was scored as high or "very aware" in >60% of women. Respondents were also asked: "If your PCOS could be safely and effectively helped by something else besides fertility drugs or birth control pills, would that interest you?" Interest in alternative PCOS treatments was expressed by 99% of the sample (n = 648). Conclusion(s): In our study population, most women associated negative emotions with PCOS although the self-reported knowledge level for the disorder was high. While these women regarded their obstetrician-gynecologist as integral to their PCOS education, traditional PCOS therapies based on oral contraceptives or ovulation induction agents were regarded as unsatisfactory by most women.
