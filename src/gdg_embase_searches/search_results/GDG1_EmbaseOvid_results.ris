N2  - Study Question: Do the siblings of Asian Indian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) manifest increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)? Summary Answer: Siblings had functional endothelial dysfunction (FMD was reduced) when compared to age and BMI-matched controls while sisters but not brothers had structural endothelial dysfunction (CIMT was increased). What is Known Already: Siblings of women with PCOS have increased metabolic risk but it varies with ethnicity. Among Asian Indians the only previous study has shown reduced FMD in brothers. Study Design, Size, Duration: This study was a tertiary care hospital-based cross-sectional case control study in the outpatient department of the endocrine clinic over 18 months. In total, 41 brothers and 35 sisters of women with PCOS (diagnosed by 2003 Rotterdam criteria) were recruited. Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods: Age (+/-2 years), sex and BMI- (+/-1 kg/m2) matched controls were selected. Cases and controls underwent clinical and biochemical investigations. Cardiologists performed doppler ultrasonogram to determine CIMT and FMD in a blinded fashion. Main Results and The Role of Chance: FMD was decreased in brothers [median 12.3% interquartile range (5.1, 19) versus 18.4% (12.6, 21.5), P = 0.002] and in sisters [10.8% (5.8, 17.2) versus 14.7% (11.4, 18.2), P = 0.027] when compared to controls. CIMT was higher in sisters [median 0.4 mm (0.35, 0.5) versus 0.3 mm (0.3, 0.4), P= 0.002] when compared to controls but not in brothers. Metabolic syndrome was more common in brothers (27% versus 5% in controls, P = 0.007) even after matching for age and BMI. Insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance and acanthosis) was higher in brothers as compared to controls. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was significantly elevated in brothers. Limitations, Reasons for Caution: There may have been referral bias of patients with PCOS in a tertiary care institute, and the radiological assessment was performed by two cardiologists serially on different time frames over the study duration. Power was only 50% in CIMT for brothers. Wider Implications of the Findings: Siblings of women with PCOS had higher CVD risk over and above the already pre-existing higher metabolic risk associated with Asian Indian ethnicity and therefore the siblings require vigilant management. Endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance seems to be a heritable trait of PCOS independent of obesity, which if confirmed in other ethnicities would have important implications.

N2  - Aim: To examine the association of serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels with biochemical derangement and sonographic appearance in PCOS women and to examine its role as a possible marker for diagnosis and prognosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Material(s) and Method(s): This case-control study was conducted on patients attending the Gynecology OPD at ESIC Medical College and Hospital, Faridabad, Haryana from March 2017 to September 2017. 45 PCOS women and controls between 18 years and 45 years were recruited. Relevant clinical, biochemical, and sonographic data were collected. Linear regression was used to study the association between biochemical and sonographic variables and PCOS. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for AMH, LH/FSH ratio, antral follicle count (AFC), and mean ovarian volume. The AMH cut-off value was determined for the prediction of PCOS. Result(s): Mean AMH levels were significantly higher in the PCOS group (5.9 v/s 2.36 ng/mL). In PCOS women, AMH levels positively correlated with AFC, mean ovarian volume, as well as androstenedione and testosterone levels. In controls, a significant positive correlation was found with serum testosterone and mean ovarian volume. An AMH had greater diagnostic potential for detecting PCOS compared to AFC, mean ovarian volume, and LH/FSH ratio. A threshold AMH value of 3.98 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 82.2% and a specificity of 93.3% for diagnosing PCOS. Conclusion(s): Serum AMH levels correlate well with hyperandrogenemia and sonographic features of PCOS and could be used as a marker for hormonal dysfunction and disease severity. Clinical significance: An AMH is a promising marker that could improve the diagnosis of PCOS and also help in establishing disease severity.Copyright © 2019, Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd.

N2  - Aim: To study the diagnostic efficacy of serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and its comparison with ultrasonography (USG). Study design: Prospective observational study. Material(s) and Method(s): In the study group, a total of 80 women in the age group of 20 to 35 years with diagnosis of PCOS by Rotterdam's criteria were recruited at B.R.D. Medical College, Gorakhpur, India, during the period from January 2015 to December 2016. Women without PCOS, having regular cycles which were selected randomly comprised the control group (n = 80). Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, androstenedione, estradiol, fasting insulin, and AMH were measured on days 2 to 3 of natural cycle or progesterone-induced withdrawal bleeding together with transvaginal sonography (TVS) for detection of the number of small follicles (<10 mm) and measurement of ovarian volume (OV). The AMH levels above 5 ng/mL were taken as diagnostic cut-off for diagnosing PCOS. Result(s): Anti-Mullerian hormone was positively correlated to LH, estradiol, testosterone, number of follicles (<10 mm), and OV; and negatively correlated to FSH. No correlation was found between AMH and age, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and fasting insulin. The AMH-based diagnosis of PCOS showed sensitivity of 91.25% and a specificity of 95%. Conclusion(s): Serum AMH level is a promising marker for diagnosis of PCOS, especially in cases where reliable USG data are not available or when there are no typical clinical and laboratory findings.Copyright © 2018, Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd.

N2  - Background: Obese women with PCOS are at high risk for developing diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A baseline oral glucose tolerance test (2hrs-OGTT) annually is an important to screen for dysglycemia in women with PCOS particularly those with at least one risk factor. Due to its advantages by fasting is not required and less day-to-day variability during periods of stress or illness, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) might consider a convenient screening tool. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of HbA1c versus 2hrs-OGTT in the diagnosis of glycemic disorders in women with PCOS and to evaluate the correlation between glycemic disorders, insulin resistance (IR), and anthropometric measures. Patients and Methods: One hundred and thirty women of a mean age 26.3 +/- 6.85 year were diagnosed with PCOS according to Rotterdam 2003 criteria in Basrah, Southern Iraq. All women were examined for weight, BMI and waist circumference then they were sent for fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2hrs-OGTT, HbA1c, and fasting insulin to assess IR. Result(s): By 2hrs-OGTT, impaired glucose tolerance and T2DM were diagnosed in 16.1% and 2.4% of women with PCOS respectively and 6.7% of lean women were prediabetes. HbA1c was underestimate the diagnosis of T2DM (0.8%) and overestimate prediabetes (20%) (p=0.011) and at HbA1c= 5.55%, the specificity was (74.3%) and sensitivity (56.5%) to discriminate normal from abnormal glucose status in women with PCOS (AUC: 0.645; 95% C.I.: 0.503-0.77; p = 0.03). One hundred women (76.9%) were either overweight or obese and most of them had IR (78%). Conclusion(s): screening of glycemic disorders is a crucial for PCOS by using 2hrs-OGTT regardless risk factor and HbA1c seems to be unsatisfactory screening tool to predict glycemic disorders in women with PCOS.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: What are the predictive factors for later development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Obesity and abdominal fat distribution in women with PCOS in the mid-fertile years were the major risk factors for T2DM development 24 years later when lifestyle factors were similar to controls. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Women with PCOS have an increased prevalence of T2DM. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A longitudinal and cross-sectional study was performed. Women with PCOS were examined in 1992 and in 2016. Randomly selected, age-matched women from the general population served as controls. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women with PCOS (n = 27), attending an outpatient clinical at a tertiary care centre for infertility or hirsutism were diagnosed in 1992 (mean age 30 years) and re-examined in 2016 (mean age 52 years). Women from the World Health Organization MONItoring of trends and determinants for CArdiovascular disease (WHO MONICA-GOT) 2008, aged 38-68 years, served as controls (n = 94), and they were previously examined in 1995. At both at baseline and at follow-up, women had blood samples taken, underwent a clinical examination and completed structured questionnaires, and the women with PCOS also underwent a glucose clamp test at baseline. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: None of women with PCOS had T2DM at baseline. At the 24-year follow-up, 19% of women with PCOS had T2DM versus 1% of controls (P < 0.01). All women with PCOS who developed T2DM were obese and had waist-hip ratio (WHR) >0.85 at baseline. No difference was seen between women with PCOS and controls regarding use of high-fat diet, Mediterranean diet or amount of physical activity at follow-up at peri/postmenopausal age. However, women with PCOS had a lower usage of a high-sugar diet as compared to controls (P = 0.01). The mean increases in BMI and WHR per year were similar in women with PCOS and controls during the follow-up period. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The small sample size of women with PCOS and the fact that they were recruited due to infertility or hirsutism make generalization to women with milder forms of PCOS uncertain. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Obesity and abdominal fat distribution, but not hyperandrogenism per se, in women with PCOS in the mid-fertile years were the major risk factors for T2DM development 24 years later when peri/postmenopausal. Lifestyle factors were similar to controls at that time. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was financed by grants from the Swedish state under the agreement between the Swedish government and the country councils, the ALF-agreement (ALFGBG-718611), the Gothenburg Medical Association GLS 694291 and 780821, the Swedish Heart Lung Foundation and Hjalmar Svensson Foundation.

N2  - Context. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is commonly associated with obesity, but the prevalence of the syndrome in obese patients is not well established. Objective. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of PCOS among overweight and obese premenopausal women and to evaluate the possible associations between the syndrome and metabolic disturbances in obese patients. Methods. Medical records of all women referred to a single endocrine center because of obesity and/or metabolic disturbances during a three-year period were analyzed. A total of 262 overweight and obese patients of reproductive age were included in the retrospective study. Results. The overall prevalence of PCOS using the Rotterdam criteria in the group of overweight and obese women was 26%. The degree of obesity did not influence the PCOS prevalence. Women with PCOS had higher blood glucose and insulin levels after glucose load in comparison to other obese patients despite the younger age. Conclusions. PCOS is a common finding among obese women seeking endocrine help. The oral glucose tolerance test is an important tool for the early detection of carbohydrate disorders in women with the syndrome. Furthermore, screening for PCOS components might be justified in young obese women with pronounced insulin resistance or dysglycemia.Copyright © 2022, Acta Endocrinologica Foundation.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of the study was to analyze the performance of the anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) level for the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in women with morbid obesity. Study design: A single-centre cross-sectional study was conducted in 50 women of reproductive age with a body mass index (BMI) >= 40 kg/m2. Each patient underwent a clinical examination, biological and hormonal assays, and an ovarian ultrasound between the third and the fifth day of the menstrual cycle. Polycystic ovary syndrome was diagnosed according to the Rotterdam's criteria. Result(s): The mean age of participants was 34.2 +/- 7.5 years. Polycystic ovary syndrome was diagnosed in 20 women (40%). Age and anthropometric parameters did not differ between women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome. The mean AMH level was significantly higher in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (3.4 +/- 3.6 vs 1.3 +/- 1.2 ng/ml, p=0.010). It was positively correlated with the Ferriman and Gallwey score (r=0.496, p=0.016), total testosterone level (r=0.524, p < 10-3) and the LH/FSH ratio (r=0.290, p=0.046). In women aged between 35 and 45 years, the optimum cut-off level for the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome was 0.81 ng/mL, providing a sensitivity and a specificity of 90 and 71%, respectively with an area under the ROC curve of 0.857. Conclusion(s): AMH level was significantly higher in morbid obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome compared with those without polycystic ovary syndrome. Specific thresholds for this population must be assessed to improve the sensitivity and specificity of AMH for the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome.Copyright © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

N2  - Women with polycystic ovary syndrome are characterized by obesity, menstruation irregularity, hirsutism and infertility, and prevalent with cardiometabolic comorbidities, but population-based studies on the risk of developing coronary artery disease are limited. From claims data of the Taiwan National Health Insurance, we identified 8048 women with polycystic ovary syndrome aged 15-49 years newly diagnosed in 1998-2013, and 32192 women without the syndrome and CAD as controls, frequency matched by age and diagnosis date. By the end of 2013, after a mean follow-up period of 5.9 years, the overall incidence of coronary artery disease was 63% higher in women with polycystic ovary syndrome than in controls (2.25 vs. 1.38 per 1000 person-years). The adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] of coronary artery disease was 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-1.81) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome, compared with controls. Hazards of coronary artery disease were significant during follow-up periods of 3-4 years (aHR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.00-2.30) and of 5-9 years (aHR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.07-2.32). The incidence of coronary artery disease increased further in those with cardiometabolic comorbidities. Among women with polycystic ovary syndrome, those with comorbid diabetes had an incidence of 35.2 per 1000 person-years, 20-fold greater than those without cardiometabolic comorbidities. In conclusion, women with polycystic ovary syndrome are at an elevated risk of coronary artery disease. Preventive interventions should be provided to them, particularly for those with the comorbidity of metabolism symptom.Copyright © Ding et al.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has become a major international public health concern. However, because of controversy about the diagnostic criteria and patient selection, estimates of its absolute prevalence and change with time vary greatly. Method(s): We conducted two consecutive nationwide epidemiological surveys of the prevalence of PCOS in representative samples of reproductive-aged women in China in 2010 and 2020. Face-to-face interviews were performed by trained interviewers in each survey. All participants completed a questionnaire and underwent a physical examination, blood sampling, and transvaginal pelvic ultrasound. We assessed hyperandrogenism (H), chronic anovulation (O), and polycystic ovaries (P) to classify the presence of PCOS using the Rotterdam criteria. The prevalence of PCOS among reproductive-aged women was estimated after consideration of differential probabilities of selection and population distribution. We conducted a logistic regression analysis by using the probability of PCOS as a function of the survey year to acquire the trend information across the years. Finding(s): 28,739 respondents completed the survey, including 15,924 in the previously published 2010 survey and 12,815 in the new 2020 survey. In 2020, 826 participants could be diagnosed as having PCOS, with a weighted prevalence of 7.8% (95%CI: 7.0%, 9.0%) among women aged 20-49 years, leading to an estimate of 24.0 million women of reproductive age affected by this condition in China as a whole. The estimated prevalence in 2020 was higher than that of a decade ago despite identical research methods suggesting a two-thirds increase over the study period. Women with PCOS in 2020 also appeared to have a more severe phenotype overall than those of a decade ago, possibly reflecting a significantly higher prevalence of obesity, hyperandrogenism, and infertility. Interpretation(s): The prevalence of PCOS in Chinese women has increased significantly over the past 10 years. PCOS is a significant public health problem in women of reproductive age in China and national policy and guidelines should be re-examined in the light of the current data.

N2  - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age and is associated with an increased risk of obesity, compensatory hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and endometrial cancer. This study analyzed 544619 women using the Korean Informative Classification of Disease, version 10, codes E28.0-E28.9 in the popu-lation-based National Health Information Databases from 2010 to 2019. The age-adjusted incidence and prevalence rates of PCOS over 10 years among Korean women were 2.8% and 4.3%, respectively; and they increased in the late teens, peaked in the 20s, and began to decrease at the age of 30. We also found that the body mass index, levels of fasting blood glucose, and high-density lipo-protein values in the recent two years (2018-2019) were higher in women with PCOS compared to the general population. This is the first study to investigate the prevalence of PCOS in a nationwide population of reproductive-aged Korean women. Further research is needed to examine the short-and long-term health risks and psychological problems associated with PCOS.Copyright © Yonsei University College of Medicine 2022.

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is among the most common, yet treatable causes of infertility. This study explored how South Korean female college students' health beliefs and knowledge of PCOS are associated with their preventive behavior intentions. Method(s): Data for this cross-sectional study were collected using an online survey of 328 female university students from July 25 to August 30, 2020. Data were analyzed using the chi-squared test and t-Test, Pearson's r, and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Result(s): The average age of participants was 21.67 years, 7.3% of whom had been diagnosed with PCOS. Perceived disability (beta = 0.30, P < 0.001) and perceived benefit (beta = 0.26, P < 0.001) of health behavior were associated with preventive behavior intentions. However, knowledge was not a significant factor. Conclusion(s): Health beliefs are related to the preventive behavior intentions of women with PCOS. Education to strengthen health beliefs should be provided to female university students.© Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: Can serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) replace polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) determined by ultrasound as a diagnostic component of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Despite good correlations between serum AMH and PCOM, the use of a high serum AMH as a proxy for PCOM resulted in the reclassification of PCOS in 5% of study participants, with the main effect being more women identified, although some women previously classified as having PCOS were no longer classified as such. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: AMH has been proposed as an alternative to PCOM as a diagnostic component of PCOS. Previous studies are limited by poorly defining PCOS, use of infertile women as comparators, measurement of hormones by immunoassay that lack precision in the female range, low-resolution ovarian ultrasound and inconsistent handling and storage of serum samples. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is an Australian cross-sectional study of 163 non-healthcare-seeking women. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Serum AMH was measured by both the Ansh picoAMH assay and the Beckman Coulter Access 2 (BA2) assay, in parallel with androgens measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, in blood samples of women, not pregnant, breast feeding or using systemic steroids, who also underwent high-resolution ovarian ultrasound. PCOS was determined by the Rotterdam criteria with PCOM defined by the Androgen Excess-PCOS Taskforce recommendation of >=25 follicles in at least one ovary. Cut-off serum concentrations that best identified women as having PCOM were identified by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 163 women, mean (SD) age 32.5 (5.5) years, who provided a blood sample and had both ovaries visualized on ultrasound were included in the analysis. Women with isolated PCOM had higher median (range) Ansh AMH and BA2 AMH concentrations than those with no PCOS characteristics [56.9 pmol/l (34.6, 104.2) versus 18.7 (3.2, 50.9), P 1/4 0.002 and 38.5 pmol/l (22.2, 100.2) versus 16.7 (3.5, 38.9), P 1/4 0.002, respectively]. An AMH >= 44.0 pmol/l, suggested by the ROC curve, identified 80.6% of women with PCOM, falsely identified 15.2% of women without PCOM as having PCOS and had a positive predictive value of 55.6%. The negative predictive value was 94.9%. An AMH BA2 assay cut-off of >=33.2 pmol/l provided a sensitivity of 80.6%, a specificity of 79.5% and a positive predictive value for PCOM of 48.1%. The negative predictive value was 94.6% for PCOM. When serum AMH was used in the place of PCOM as a diagnostic criterion for PCOS, the Ansh assay resulted in an additional seven women classified as having PCOS and no longer classified one woman as having PCOS. For the BA2 assay, eight additional and two fewer women were classified as having PCOS. Overall, both assays resulted in six more women being classified as having PCOS. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Women with functional hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism were not excluded and may have been misclassified as having an oligo-amenorrhoea-PCOM phenotype. As study participants were predominantly Caucasian/White, our findings cannot be generalized to women of other ethnicities. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Although serum AMH reflects the number of developing ovarian follicles, the absolute values vary between assays and specific reference ranges for individual assays are required. Irrespective of the assay used, replacing PCOM with serum AMH to diagnose PCOS in a community-based sample altered the number of women classified as having or not having PCOS. Consequently, although overall the risk of women being identified as having PCOS would be increased, some women would no longer be classified as having this condition.

N2  - Background and Aims: This updated meta-analysis aimed to further quantify the risk of endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thus providing updated and more reliable estimates. Methods and Results: We identified relevant articles by searching electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Chinese Biological Medical Literature (CBM) published up to March 20, 2021. The pooled effect estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random-effect model or the fixed-effect model. A total of 26 eligible studies were included. We found that PCOS was significantly associated with endometrial cancer (odds ratios [OR]: 3.66, 95%CI: 2.05-6.54, P < 0.001), but not with ovarian or breast cancer (OR: 1.23, 95%CI: 0.99-1.53, P = 0.059; OR: 0.94, 95%CI: 0.78-1.14, P = 0.551, respectively). However, in subgroups of high-quality studies, cohort studies, younger women (54 years or less or premenopausal), and studies with unadjusted body mass index (BMI), PCOS patients had a significantly higher risk of ovarian cancer. Conclusion(s): These results indicated that PCOS is a significant risk factor for endometrial cancer independent of BMI, but not for breast cancer. PCOS may increase the risk of ovarian cancer in younger women.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

N2  - The purpose of the study was to compare the ovarian stromal blood flow and stromal thickness (ST) of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients, with healthy women with polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) and normal ovarian morphology (NOM). A total of 220 participants were recruited and the three study groups were determined by diagnostic criteria (PCOS n = 106, PCOM n = 68, NOM n = 46). Clinical, hormonal and ultrasonographic measurements of ovaries were assessed and compared. PCOS patients showed statistically higher androgen levels, insulin resistance, hirsutism score, ovarian ST and stromal blood flow compared to PCOM and NOM. The correlation between free androgen index (FAI) and ST was measured. FAI was significantly highly correlated with left ovarian ST (0.83; p <.001) and right ovarian ST (0.83; p <.001). According to the results of this study, the ovarian ST which can be considered as ultrasonographic indicator of FAI, can be used in PCOS diagnosis. Also, it can be suggested that there is no statistically significant difference in ovarian ST and doppler findings between healthy women with PCOM or NOM. ROC analysis was used to measure diagnostic utility of ST. Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Although it is known that ovarian stromal blood flows and stromal thickness are increased in PCOS disease compared to healthy women, they are not included in the diagnostic criteria. What the results of this study add? In the results of this study, it was determined that ovarian stromal blood flow and stromal thickness were increased in PCOS patients, as previously reported in the literature. In addition, these ultrasound measurements were found to be increased in PCOS patients compared to healthy women with PCO morphology, and stromal thickness measurements were strongly correlated with the free androgen index in PCOS patients. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Ovarian ST and/or S/A ratio may be an ultrasonograpic indicator of FAI, and may be used in PCOS diagnostic criterias. In the future, it can be revealed whether they vary in patients with different components of the syndrome, by examining these parameters in different PCOS phenotypes.Copyright © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Objective: To determine the association between hyperandrogenism (HA) and polycystic ovarian morphology in a Chinese cohort of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and the usefulness of anti-Mullerian hormone Methods: Patients who visited the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Indus Medical College Tando Muhammad Khan between May 2020 and October 2020 were the subjects of a prospective case-control study. According to Rotterdam criteria, 50 females with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and 50 females without the condition participated in the study. Result(s): An teenage patient clinic at our hospital enrolled 100 consecutive patients (50 by PCOS, 50 by healthy controls aged equal to the adolescent patients). Menstrual anomaly and hirsutism were most common in the study group, while vaginal discharge was most common in the control group. Analyses of anthropometric measures between the two groups showed a significant difference (p<0.05). In the PCOS group, both plasma fasting insulin (p-value = 0.001) and HOMA index (p value =0.003) had statistically greater values. PCOS patients also had significantly higher means of fT and 17-OH-P, as well as LH and LH/FSH ratios. Serum AMH levels were found to be negatively correlated with FSH levels in all patients (r=-0.238, p=0.031). The AUC value indicated by ROC analysis for distinguishing PCOS was 0.678. However, the sensitivity and specificity scores according to the highest Youden index were 47.8% and 76.1%, respectively. Conclusion(s): The Anti-Mullerian hormone level is also linked to the existence of polycystic ovary morphology, which suggests that the AMH level might have a role in the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS.Copyright © 2022 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

N2  - The two most frequent causes of secondary amenorrhea are polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). Despite several studies showing differences in hormonal profile between these groups, the differential diagnosis remains challenging, in particular between FHA women with polycystic ovarian morphology (FHA-PCOM) and PCOS patients without hyperandrogenism (phenotype D, PCOS-D). In a retrospective case-control study, 58 clearly defined patients with FHA-PCOM were compared to 58 PCOS-D patients, matched 1:1 for age and BMI. Significantly higher levels of LH, estradiol, testosterone, and a higher luteinizing hormone (LH): follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio as well as lower sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels were found in PCOS-D patients (p< 0.05). Optimized cut-off values for the prediction of FHA-PCOM were calculated by the Youden index. The highest sensitivity was found for an estradiol serum level <37.5 pg/mL (84.5%, 95% confidence interval, CI: 72.6-92.6), whereas a LH : FSH ratio <0.96 had the highest specificity (94.8, 95% CI: 85.6-98.9). A linear discriminant analysis including testosterone, SHBG and LH was able to correctly classify 87.9% of FHA-PCOM patients (bootstrap 95% CI: 80.2 - 94.0%). In conclusion, this model including serological parameters could be an easy and reliable tool to distinguish between FHA-PCOM and PCOS-D patients, especially in situations where the clinical profile is not obvious.Copyright © 2022 Beitl, Dewailly, Seemann, Hager, Bunker, Mayrhofer, Holzer and Ott.

N2  - The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of the combination of anogenital distance (AGD) and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The study included women diagnosed with PCOS and a control group who attended the Clinical University Hospital 'Virgen de la Arrixaca' in Murcia (Spain). Serum concentrations of AMH were measured and two AGD measurements were obtained: (i) from the anterior clitoral surface to the upper verge of the anus (AGDAC); and (ii) from the posterior fourchette to the upper verge of the anus (AGDAF). Data were assessed by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Women with PCOS (n = 126) had significantly larger AGDAC (80.5 +/- 11.3 versus 76.0 +/- 10.4 mm; p < 0.001) and higher AMH (7.2 +/- 4.7 versus 3.1 +/- 2.2; p < 0.001) compared to control women (n = 159). Women with serum AMH above 3.8 ng/mL (clinical cut-off used in PCOS) were 9.1 times more likely to have PCOS (95% CI: 5.1-16.2). The area under the ROC curve of combined model of AMH and AGDAC was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.83-0.91). The combined model for predicting PCOS based on AMH and AGDAC has better diagnostic accuracy than that of AMH or AGDAC alone. This model could be useful for clinicians and improve diagnosis and clinical management of these women.Copyright © 2020 The British Fertility Society.

N2  - BACKGROUND Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder in women of reproductive age. Over the last few decades, research studies have revealed that PCOS is strongly associated with metabolic disorders, including metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance and prediabetes. Clinical observation has shown that women with PCOS are expected to have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in the future. AIM To assess the hazard ratio (HR) of T2DM between women with/without PCOS. METHODS This population-based, retrospective cohort study evaluated data retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database. The subjects were women with PCOS (n = 2545) identified on the basis of diagnosis, testing, or treatment codes, and women without PCOS as controls (n = 2545). The HR of T2DM between women with or without PCOS was the main outcome measure analyzed. RESULTS Our study found that, during a 10-year follow-up period, the overall incidence of T2DM was 6.25 per 1000 person-years in the PCOS group compared with 1.49 in the control group. After adjustment for potential confounding variables, the overall incidence of T2DM was higher in the PCOS group vs the control group (HR = 5.13, 95%CI: 3.51-7.48, P < 0.0001). The risk of developing T2DM subsequent to PCOS decreased with increasing diagnosis age: the adjusted HR was 10.4 in the 18-24-year age group, 5.28 in the 25-29-year age group, and 4.06 in the 29-34-year age group. However, no such significant association was noted in women older than 35 years. CONCLUSION These findings highlight the importance of prompting a more aggressive treatment to prevent diabetes in women diagnosed with PCOS at a young age, and, in contrast, the lessened importance of this type of intervention in women diagnosed with PCOS at a late reproductive age.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

N2  - Objective: Despite the clear evidence of increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, the long-term effect on CVD and mortality is still uncertain in women with PCOS, especially in the elderly. Studies in elderly women with PCOS are lacking. The objective was to study morbidity/mortality in PCOS women compared with a reference group up to a mean age above 80 years. Study design: A well-defined cohort of women with PCOS, examined in 1987 and 2008, was re-examined 32 years later in 2019 (age range 72-91 years), in parallel with an age-matched reference group. For deceased women register data was used, for women alive interviews were done, and medical records studied. Blood pressure and blood tests were analyzed. Morbidity and mortality data was available in 35/36 women with PCOS, and in 99/118 women in the reference group. Result(s): At mean age 81 years there was no difference in all-cause mortality (HR 1.1, ns), CVD-related mortality (HR 1.7, ns), all CVD (HR 1.2, ns), hypertension (HR 1.8, ns), type 2 diabetes (HR 1.7, ns), in levels of blood lipids, glucose, insulin or thyroid hormones. Comparing baseline data from the deceased and living women with PCOS, no differences were found regarding age, menopausal age, BMI, HOMA-IR, FAI, total testosterone or SHBG. However, deceased women with PCOS had a higher WHR (0.87 vs. 0.80; p-value < 0.01) at baseline. Conclusion(s): No evidence of increased all-cause mortality or CVD was found in women with PCOS. The elevated testosterone levels and CVD risk profile in PCOS present during perimenopause do not seem to be associated with increased CVD morbidity/mortality risk later in life.Copyright © 2022 The Authors

N2  - Background: The existing data regarding the impact of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) on the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) are conflicting. Aim(s): To explore the effect of PCOS status on the occurrence of silent coronary artery disease (CAD)/CVD. Method(s): A total of 1591 women without CVD at baseline, aged 18-45 years, including 356 PCOS patients (defined by the Rotterdam criteria) and 1235 eumenorrheic non-hirsute women without polycystic ovarian morphology (controls), were selected from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS). The median follow-up was 15.4 years, and most participants were in their late reproductive years at the end of the study. Silent CAD and CVD outcomes in PCOS and control groups were compared according to the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and cumulative hazard functions. Result(s): There was no difference in CVD risk factors between the PCOS and control groups. After controlling for confounders, PCOS status did not increase the risk of silent CAD (HR: 0.96, 95% CI 0.86-1.08). Regardless of PCOS status, women with a history of silent CAD showed 2.25 times higher CVD events than those without this history (95% CI 1.63-3.10). PCOS status reduced the CVD incidence by 42%, independently of silent CAD or traditional risk factors (HR: 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.98). Conclusion(s): Whereas silent CAD, regardless of PCOS, accelerated CVD, PCOS preserved it, most likely due to a combination of protective factors, including the endocrine pattern in the late reproductive period, environmental/social elements, and recruiting additional counseling and lifestyle modifications.Copyright © 2021

N2  - Objectives: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), its phenotypical and cardio-metabolic features in a community sample of the Iranian population in comparison to healthy eumenorrheic, non-hirsute women without polycystic ovaries. The second aim was to assess the cardio-metabolic characteristics of women who suffered from one criteria of PCOS compared to those healthy eumenorrheic, non-hirsute women. Method(s): In this cross-sectional population-based study, a total of 1,960 eligible women, aged (18-45 years) were recruited from the Tehran-Lipid and Glucose-Study participants and were classified as the three groups of (i) women with PCOS by the Rotterdam criteria, (ii) non-PCOS women with one criteria of PCOS and (iii) healthy eumenorrheic, non-hirsute women without polycystic ovaries morphology (PCOM) as the control group. Further PCOS women were extended to four phenotypes of hyperandrogenism, oligo-anovulation, polycystic ovaries (phenotype A), hyperandrogenism, oligo/anovulation (phenotype B), hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries (phenotype C) and oligo-anovulation, polycystic ovaries (phenotype D). Cardio-metabolic profiles and the prevalence of comorbidities of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and lipid abnormalities were compared among these groups linear, and the median regression models adjusted for age and body mass index. Result(s): The prevalence of PCOS according to the diagnostic criteria of the NIH, Rotterdam and AE-PCOS Society were 13.6, 19.4, and 17.8, respectively. Among those who met the Rotterdam criteria, 23.9, 46.3, 21.6, and 8.2% had phenotypes A, B, C, and D, respectively. Among the remaining 1,580 women who did not fulfil the PCOS criteria, 108 (6.8%) suffered from only oligo/anovulation, 332 (21%) only hyperandrogenism/hyperandrogenemia, 159 (16.2%) only PCOM in ultrasound and 981 (62%) were healthy eumenorrheic, non-hirsute women without PCOM. The study revealed that some adiposity indices and lipid abnormalities in PCOS phenotypes with hyperandrogenism (A, B, and C) were worse than in healthy women. By contrast, women with phenotype D did not differ from the healthy ones in terms of adiposity and lipid abnormalities. However, the respective values for other cardio-metabolic profiles and MetS rates in different phenotypes of PCOS were similar to the healthy women. Only the prevalence of MetS in phenotype A was significantly higher than in the healthy women. There were no statistically significant differences between participants with one criteria of PCOS and healthy counterparts in terms of most adiposity indexes, cardio-metabolic factors, and comorbidity of MetS and its components. However, women with hyperandrogenism had a significantly higher level of the waist to height ratio (WHtR) and hypertriglyceridemia than their healthy counterparts. Conclusion(s): PCOS, mainly classical phenotypes A and B, are common among Iranian women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS who had androgen excess exhibited the worst lipid profile, and those who had full three criteria of the syndrome exhibited the higher rate of MetS. However, women with only ovulatory dysfunction and only PCOM had similar cardio-metabolic characteristics, compared to healthy subjects. These data suggest that routine screening for metabolic disturbances may be needed in the prevention of cardio-metabolic disorders in patients with more serious phenotypes of PCOS.Copyright © 2022 Farhadi-Azar, Behboudi-Gandevani, Rahmati, Mahboobifard, Khalili Pouya, Ramezani Tehrani and Azizi.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate whether maternal PCOS could impact growth and development in offspring at an early age through continuous observation from age 3 months to 6 years. Method(s): This prospective study was conducted in 198 children born to mothers with PCOS and 227 children born to healthy mothers in Ningbo (Zhejiang Province, China) between October 2012 and July 2015. Measurements of offspring height, weight, head circumference, and teething were examined by trained professionals through age 6 years. Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were analysed using repeated measures analysis of variance between the PCOS and control groups. Result(s): Offspring born to women with PCOS showed significantly higher BMI at age 12, 18, and 30 months and 5 years (P = 0.040, P = 0.000, P = 0.000, and P = 0.023, respectively). Female offspring born to women with PCOS showed significantly increased body weight at 3, 8, 12, 18, and 30 months, and 3 and 6 years (P = 0.027, P = 0.008, P = 0.010, P = 0.034, P = 0.047, P = 0.040, and P = 0.035, respectively) and significantly higher BMI at 3, 8, 12, 18, and 30 months (P = 0.009, P = 0.016, P = 0.029, P = 0.000, and P = 0.000, respectively). After adjusting for maternal, paternal, and pregnancy confounders, PCOS status presented significant associations with weight at age 3, 8, and 12 months and 3 years (P = 0.005, P = 0.004, P = 0.021, P = 0.035 respectively), and with BMI at age 3 and 8 months (P = 0.011 and P = 0.014) in female offspring. Conclusion(s): Maternal PCOS is associated with an increased risk of developing obesity in female offspring.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Objective: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a worsened metabolic profile but the progression of cardiometabolic features over time is unclear. Understanding this natural history is a key priority in PCOS research and vital for guiding the prevention and management of this common condition. We explored cardiometabolic changes that are observed in women with PCOS compared to those without PCOS across the life course. Design, Patients and Measurements: A systematic review of longitudinal cohort studies was conducted across MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid PsycInfo, CINAHL PLUS and EBM reviews between 15 January 2020 and 11 February 2021. Eligible studies included participants with or without PCOS diagnosed according to the 2003 Rotterdam or the 1990 National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria. We included studies that were published from the year 1990 to 2021 with data on cardiometabolic outcomes as per the PCOS core outcomes set. Result(s): There were 31 longitudinal studies with 28,316 participants from four continents. At the start of follow up, participants were aged between 1 year and 49 years with a follow-up period ranging from 2 to 32 years. Changes in BMI and the risk of coronary heart disease were similar in adult women with and without PCOS. Women with PCOS had a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes than their non-PCOS counterparts. Evidence for the majority of all other outcomes was conflicting and with inadequate data. Conclusion(s): Understanding the natural history of PCOS and particularly changes in cardiometabolic features remains challenging. Existing literature is extensive but heterogeneous and inconsistent. Longitudinal studies in unselected populations are needed to provide high-quality data in this area.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex reproductive disorder characterised by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic/enlarged ovary. Although clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism is one of the major features of PCOS, biochemical hyperandrogenism in the form of high testosterone and/or Free Androgen Index (FAI) is rarely observed in the Asian Indians. Aim(s): To assess various androgens to determine best available biomarker of androgens in PCOS from North India. Material(s) and Method(s): This case-control study was conducted at Department of Reproductive Biology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, between January 2016 to December 2019. During this period 137 female with PCOS and 49 female as control were included. Serum total testosterone (T), FAI, Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulphate (DHEAS), androstenedione and Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were measured besides assessment of hirsutism using the Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) scale. Statistical differences were derived using Mann-Whitney U test, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and Spearman's correlation test. Result(s): There were 87 PCOS cases with phenotype A, 25 PCOS cases with phenotype B, 10 PCOS cases with phenotype C and 15 PCOS cases with phenotype D. The mean age was 23.7 years in the PCOS group and 26.2 years in the control group. The mean body mass index in the PCOS group was 25.23 kg/m2 and in the control was 22.6 kg/m2. FG score of >=9 was observed in 75.9% PCOS cases. High (mean+2SD) levels of T (>=0.51 ng/ mL), FAI (>=2.55), DHEAS (>=309 ug/dL), androstenedione (>=2.2 ng/mL) and DHT (>=462 pg/mL) were observed in 35.29%, 56.25%, 14.18%, 18.62% and 61.38%, cases, respectively. Mean DHT value was 584.27 pg/mL in study group whereas in control was 257.16 pg/mL (p-value <0.0001) and area under ROC curve was 0.895. Similarly, area under ROC curve was 0.86, 0.817, 0.721 and 0.63 for FAI, testosterone, DHEAS and androstenedione, respectively. Spearman's correlation test of androgens with body mass index, age and FG Score did not find any associations with DHT. Conclusion(s): Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is best available biomarker and can be considered as diagnostic biomarker of hyperandrogenemia in PCOS women from north India.Copyright © 2022 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

N2  - Background: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are characterized by increased cardiometabolic risk. The aim of the current study was to compare the impact of atorvastatin on plasma levels of cardiometabolic risk factors between men whose sisters had either PCOS or were unaffected. Method(s): The study population consisted of two age-, fat-free mass index-, blood pressure- and plasma lipid-matched groups of men with elevated total and LDL cholesterol levels: 20 brothers of PCOS probands (group 1) and 20 brothers of healthy women (group 2). Both groups were then treated with atorvastatin (40 mg daily) for the following 6 months. At the beginning and at the end of the study, we assessed plasma lipid levels, glucose homeostasis markers and levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, uric acid, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), homocysteine, fibrinogen and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Result(s): At the beginning of the study, both treatment arms differed in the degree of insulin resistance, calculated bioavailable testosterone, as well as in plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, uric acid, hsCRP and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Although atorvastatin reduced total and LDL cholesterol levels, this effect was stronger in group 2 than group 1. In group 2, atorvastatin exerted also a more potent impact on hsCRP, fibrinogen and homocysteine. An unfavorable impact on insulin sensitivity was observed only in group 1; while, statistically significant changes in uric acid and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were found only in group 2. Conclusion(s): The obtained results suggest that cardiometabolic effects of atorvastatin are less pronounced in male siblings of PCOS probands than in brothers of unaffected women.Copyright © 2020, Maj Institute of Pharmacology Polish Academy of Sciences.

N2  - Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine problem with complex diagnosis in adolescents. Therefore, it is important to identify reliable biomarkers that can be used in the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents. To investigate the diagnostic value of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin-A (INH-A) and insulin-like peptide-3 (INSL3) in adolescents with PCOS, and to explain the relationship between these hormones and the clinical / laboratory findings of hyperandrogenism. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-five girls aged 15-20 years who were diagnosed with PCOS were included in the present study. The control group consisted of healthy adolescents who had regular menstrual cycles for at least two years and were compatible with the study group according to age and body mass index (BMI). The hormonal profile was assessed in the PCOS and control group. Transabdominal pelvic ultrasonography was performed only in the PCOS group. Result(s): AMH and INH-A levels were found to be significantly higher in the PCOS group than control group. While the INSL3 did not correlate with anthropometric or laboratory parameters, AMH level showed a positive correlation with the WC SDS, waist / hip ratio, FAI, LH, fT and INH-A. Moreover, INH-A level showed a positive correlation with WC SDS, LH, LH / FSH ratio, SHBG and AMH. In receiver-operating characteristic analysis, the cut-off value for AMH for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents was 5.8 ng / mL that for INH-A was 9.3 pg/mL (the specificity and sensitivity were 86% and 70% and 66% and 82% respectively). When AMH and INH-A were used in combination, the specificity and sensitivity were 74% and 88%, respectively. Conclusion(s): INH-A and AMH can be used as new biomarkers for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents, while INSL3 has no diagnostic value in this regard.Copyright © 2021, Galenos Publishing House.

N2  - Purpose: The exact risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is unknown. It is also unclear if obesity independently increases T2DM risk in this population. The aim of this study was to systematically review and synthesize the best available evidence regarding the association between PCOS and T2DM, stratified according to obesity status. Method(s): A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, CENTRAL and Scopus databases up to October 31, 2020. Data are expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The I2 index was employed for heterogeneity. Result(s): The eligibility criteria were fulfilled by 23 studies (319,780 participants; 60,336 PCOS and 8847 type 2 diabetes cases). Women with PCOS demonstrated a higher risk of T2DM than those without PCOS (RR 3.45, 95% CI, 2.95-4.05, p < 0.001; I2 81.6%). This risk remained significant both in studies matched or unmatched for participants' age. With regard to body mass index (BMI), the RR for developing T2DM in obese and non-obese PCOS women compared with their non-PCOS counterparts was 3.24 (95% CI 2.25-4.65; p < 0.001; I2 30.9%) and 1.62 (95% CI 0.14-18.50; p = 0.70; I2 89.9%), respectively. The RR for developing T2DM was 3.85 (95% CI 1.99-7.43; p < 0.001; I2 46.2%) in obese compared with non-obese women with PCOS. This was also the case for overweight compared with lean women with PCOS. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS present an increased risk of T2DM compared with non-PCOS women only if they are obese/overweight.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Objective: To determine a cutoff for the Elecsys AMH Plus immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics International Ltd, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) to identify polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM), a polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) criterion. Design(s): The AMH Protein in Humans for polycystic ovaRian mOrphology DIagnostic TEsting (APHRODITE) study was a retrospective, multicenter, case-control study. The serum antimullerian hormone (AMH) level was measured using the Elecsys AMH Plus immunoassay. The antral follicle count was determined using transvaginal ultrasound. An AMH cutoff was derived and validated in separate cohorts with cases of PCOS with full phenotype A (oligo/anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and PCOM) versus that with controls. Exploratory analyses of age and PCOS phenotype were performed. Setting(s): Not applicable. Patient(s): Polycystic ovary syndrome-positive (PCOS A-D per the Rotterdam criteria) and PCOS-negative women aged 25-45 years. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): A validated cutoff for AMH using the Elecsys AMH Plus assay for PCOM. Result(s): In the validation cohort (455 cases and 500 controls), an AMH cutoff of 3.2 ng/mL (23 pmol/L) resulted in a sensitivity of 88.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 85.3-91.3) and specificity of 84.6% (95% CI 81.1-87.7) for PCOM diagnosis as well as an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of 93.6% (95% CI 92.2-95.1). In women aged 25-35 years, the sensitivity and specificity for the cutoff were 88.5% and 80.3%, respectively, versus 77.8% and 90.1%, respectively, in women aged 36-45 years. The results were consistent across PCOS phenotypes A-D. Conclusion(s): The Elecsys AMH Plus immunoassay, with a cutoff of 3.2 ng/mL (23 pmol/L), is a robust method for identifying PCOM to aid in PCOS diagnosis.Copyright © 2021 The Authors

N2  - Purpose: This study was designed to explore the value of ovarian volume (OV) measured by transvaginal ultrasound and its relationship with anthropometry and serum hormonal levels in a polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) population. Patients and Methods: A total of 119 women with PCOS from infertile couples were recruited in this cross-sectional study. On days 2-4 of the menstrual cycle, transvaginal ultrasound examinations were performed, and hormonal profiles were measured. PCOS diagnosis was based on the Rotterdam 2003 criteria and classified into four phenotype groups. The PCOS group (study group) and the non-PCOS group (control group) were compared. Result(s): The mean age of the participants was 32.66+/-4.10 years compared to 33.99+/-4.78 years in 273 cases (69.6%) without PCOS. The mean OV was statistically larger in the PCOS group than in the non-PCOS group (7.65+/-3.23 mL vs 6.08+/-3.67 mL, p < 0.001) and positively correlated with serum anti-Mullerian (AMH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (r=0.30; p < 0.001 and r=0.23; p < 0.001, respectively), and weakly and inversely correlated with age (-0.182, p < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of OV in the diagnosis of PCOS was 0.613 (0.557-0.670, 95% CI). Conclusion(s): The enlarged OV is remarkable in women with PCOS and is related to AMH and LH concentrations. Although the diagnostic potential of PCOS is substantially low, OV alone may contribute to predicting the severity of PCOS and better performance for the diagnosis of PCOS phenotypes.Copyright © 2021 Le et al.

N2  - The identification of hyperandrogenism in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is concerning because of the poor accuracy of the androgen immunoassays (IA) and controversies regarding which androgens should be measured. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of the assessment of testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A) by liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS), in the diagnosis of PCOS. We evaluated 131 patients referred for suspected PCOS. Fourteen patients in total were excluded, some because of other diagnosis (n = 7) or incomplete diagnostic workup (n = 7). We measured T and A both by IA and LC-MS/MS in the 117 subjects included. We calculated free T (fT) by the Vermeulen formula and recorded clinical and metabolic data. 73 healthy females served as controls to derive immunoassays (IA) and LC-MS/MS reference intervals for T, fT and A. PCOS was confirmed in 90 subjects by IA and in 93 (+3.3%) by LC-MS/MS. The prevalence of biochemical hyperandrogenism in PCOS by LC-MS/MS increased from 81.7% to 89.2% if A was also considered. The most frequently elevated androgens were fT (73.1%) and A (64.5%) and they had similar levels of accuracy in differentiating PCOS and controls (0.34 ng/dL, Sn 91% Sp 89%; 1.16 ng/mL, Sn 91% Sp 88%, respectively). Free testosterone correlated with body mass index (BMI), homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-index, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and sex-binding globulin (SHBG). The results confirm that LC-MS/MS is slightly more sensitive than IA in the diagnosis of PCOS with LC-MS/MS detecting higher levels of fT and A. Moreover, assessment of fT and A by LC-MS/MS had a similar level of accuracy in discriminating between PCOs and control subjects. Lastly, fT by LC-MS/MS correlates with adverse metabolic parameters.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the body mass index and neurologic development of 1-2 years offspring born to mothers with polycystic ovary syndrome. Study Design: A case-control study. Place and Duration of Study: Dongyang Women and Children's Hospital, Zhejiang Province, China, between June 2018 and January 2019. Methodology: A total of 145 children were included in the final analysis, including 16 daughters of mothers with PCOS, 13 sons of mothers with PCOS, 55 daughters of mothers without PCOS and 61 sons of mothers without PCOS. Developmental assessments for each child were conducted, including anthropometric measurements and ability developments using the Denver developmental screening test. Result(s): The body mass index of children was significantly lower in polycystic ovary syndrome group than control group (p=0.022). Children of mothers with polycystic ovary syndrome and control group had no significant differences in the outcomes of the Denver developmental screening test (all p >0.05). Conclusion(s): Maternal polycystic ovary syndrome may affect body mass index of offspring aged 1-2 years and had no negative effects on neurologic development. However, this conclusion may be limited due to the small sample size.Copyright © 2021 College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: The majority of available studies on the AMH thresholds were not age-specific and performed the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, based on variations in sensitivity and specificity rather than positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively), which are more clinically applicable. Moreover, all of these studies used a pre-specified age categorization to report the age-specific cut-off values of AMH. Method(s): A total of 803 women, including 303 PCOS patients and 500 eumenorrheic non-hirsute control women, were enrolled in the present study. The PCOS group included PCOS women, aged 20-40 years, who were referred to the Reproductive Endocrinology Research Center, Tehran, Iran. The Rotterdam consensus criteria were used for diagnosis of PCOS. The control group was selected among women, aged 20-40 years, who participated in Tehran Lipid and Glucose cohort Study (TLGS). Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to identify the optimal cut-off points for various age categories. The cut-off levels of AMH in different age categories were estimated, using the Bayesian method. Main results and the role of chance: Two optimal cut-off levels of AMH (ng/ml) were identified at the age of 27 and 35 years, based on GAMs. The cut-off levels for the prediction of PCOS in the age categories of 20-27, 27-35, and 35-40 years were 5.7 (95 % CI: 5.48-6.19), 4.55 (95 % CI: 4.52-4.64), and 3.72 (95 % CI: 3.55-3.80), respectively. Based on the Bayesian method, the PPV and NPV of these cut-off levels were as follows: PPV = 0.98 (95 % CI: 0.96-0.99) and NPV = 0.40 (95 % CI: 0.30-0.51) for the age group of 20-27 years; PPV = 0.96 (95 % CI: 0.91-0.99) and NPV = 0.82 (95 % CI: 0.78-0.86) for the age group of 27-35 years; and PPV = 0.86 (95 % CI: 0.80-0.94) and NPV = 0.96 (95 % CI: 0.93-0.98) for the age group of 35-40 years. Conclusion(s): Application of age-specific cut-off levels of AMH, according to the GAMs and Bayesian method, could elegantly assess the value of AMH in discriminating PCOS patients in all age categories.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Context: The effects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are unclear. Objective(s): This work aims to establish the relative risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, angina, revascularization, and cardiovascular mortality for women with PCOS. Method(s): Data were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum database. Patients with PCOS were matched to controls (1:1) by age, body mass index (BMI) category, and primary care practice. The primary outcome was the time to major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE); a composite end point incorporating MI, stroke, angina, revascularization and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were the individual MACE end points. Result(s): Of 219 034 individuals with a diagnosis of PCOS, 174 660 (79.7%) met the eligibility criteria and were matched. Crude rates of the composite end point, MI, stroke, angina, revascularization, and cardiovascular mortality were respectively 82.7, 22.7, 27.4, 32.8, 10.5, and 6.97 per 100 000 patient-years for cases, and 64.3, 15.9, 25.7, 19.8, 7.13, and 7.75 per 100 000 patient-years for controls. In adjusted Cox proportional hazard models (CPHMs), the hazard ratios (HRs) were 1.26 (95% CI, 1.13-1.41), 1.38 (95% CI, 1.11-1.72), 1.60 (95% CI, 1.32-1.94), and 1.50 (95% CI, 1.08-2.07) for the composite outcome, MI, angina, and revascularization, respectively. In a time-dependent CPHM, weight gain (HR 1.01; 1.00-1.01), prior type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (HR 2.40; 1.76-3.30), and social deprivation (HR 1.53; 1.11-2.11) increased risk of progression to the composite end point. Conclusion(s): The risk of incident MI, angina, and revascularization is increased in young women with PCOS. Weight and T2DM are potentially modifiable risk factors amenable to intervention.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society.

N2  - Brothers of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were found to be at increased risk for cardiometabolic disorders. This risk may be exacerbated by concurrent poorly controlled hypertension. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are the most frequently used antihypertensive drugs. The aim of the present study was to compare blood pressure-lowering and pleiotropic effects of telmisartan between male siblings of PCOS probands and unrelated men. The study included 2 age-, blood pressure-, and mass index-matched groups of men with grade 1 hypertension: 24 brothers of women with PCOS (group A) and 26 brothers of healthy women (group B). All subjects were treated with telmisartan (80 mg daily). Blood pressure, glucose homeostasis markers, and plasma lipids, as well as plasma levels of total testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, androstenedione, uric acid, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), homocysteine, fibrinogen, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured before and after 12 weeks of therapy. At entry, there were between-group differences in the degree of insulin resistance, plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, calculated bioavailable testosterone, androstenedione, hsCRP, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Although telmisartan reduced blood pressure in both study groups, this effect was stronger in group B. Irrespective of the study group, the drug improved insulin sensitivity and reduced circulating levels of uric acid and homocysteine, but these effects were more pronounced in group B than group A. Only in group B, telmisartan decreased hsCRP and fibrinogen, as well as increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The obtained results suggest that hypertensive male relatives of PCOS probands may gain less benefit from telmisartan treatment than unrelated hypertensive men.Copyright © 2021, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology

N2  - Objective: To investigate the relationship between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Korean women. Design(s): Longitudinal case-control study. Setting(s): Not applicable. Patient(s): PCOS patients aged 15 to 44 years (n = 1,136) and control individuals (n = 5,675), matched 1:5 by age group, income, and region of residence. Intervention(s): Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure(s): The occurrence of T2DM. Result(s): In the PCOS and control groups, 15.7% and 14.4%, respectively, were obese (body mass index >=25 kg/m2). The incidence rate of T2DM was 15.84/1,000 and 5.80/1,000 person-years in the PCOS and control groups, respectively. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of T2DM in women with PCOS was 2.6-fold higher than that in control individuals. Women with PCOS still had a higher HR of T2DM than did control individuals after adjustment for body mass index, family history of T2DM, physical exercise level, and total cholesterol. PCOS was significantly associated with T2DM in women both with and without obesity. Conclusion(s): PCOS is independently associated with an increased incidence of T2DM in both obese and nonobese women. Screening for T2DM should be considered for both obese and nonobese women with PCOS in Korea.Copyright © 2020 The Authors

N2  - Background: We established age-group-specific reference intervals for serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in a Korean population and investigated the effectiveness of AMH assay for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis. Method(s): We analyzed serum levels of AMH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) from 1540 Korean women. Subjects were divided into three groups: healthy, benign gynecologic diseases, and PCOS. Age-group-specific reference intervals and AMH diagnostic performance were estimated. Result(s): The PCOS group had a median AMH level of 7.0 microg/L, which was higher than for the healthy (1.8 microg/L) and the benign gynecologic diseases (2.7 microg/L) groups. The upper 97.5% reference limits for age groups 12-20 years, 21-34 years, and 35-46 years were 13.2 microg/L, 15.8 microg/L, and 6.6 microg/L, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) values to estimate AMH ability to discriminate PCOS from healthy women for each age group were 0.741, 0.785, and 0.789, respectively. AUCs for LH/FSH were 0.719, 0.672, and 0.590. Conclusion(s): The better diagnostic ability of AMH over LH/FSH in women of late childbearing ages indicates that age and other clinical characteristics should be considered when interpreting these test results.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is expressed by the granulosa cells of the pre-antral and small antral follicles in the ovary. AMH serum levels are significantly higher in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) due to an increased antral follicle counts (AFC) and a higher production of AMH per antral follicle. This research is a cohort study design with a sample size of 60 female patients with (n = 30) and without PCOS (n = 30) in which the relationship between AMH serum level and other hormonal markers was explored. The following measurements were taken from the patients on the fifth day of the menstrual cycle: AMH, glucose, index of insulin resistance (HOMA/IR), body mass index (BMI), testosterone and cholesterol, lipoproteins, and triglycerides. The study proposes diagnostic criteria for PCOS. A twofold increase in the AMH serum levels was observed in the PCOS group when compared to the control group. The following incremental increases were seen in AMH serum levels: testosterone (18.4%); fasting blood glucose (18%); fasting insulin (83.86%); HOMA/IR (64.23%); mean cholesterol (30%); mean triglycerides (17%); and BMI (26.75%). All differences were considered significant at p 0.005. The results from the study concluded that monitoring the level of AMH allows for the prediction of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) during ovulation induction and assisted reproductive technology cycles. Monitoring of anti-Mullerian hormone levels may provide an additional marker for determining treatment strategies when presented with additional risks associated with overweight, hirsutism, type II diabetes, infertility, and cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the threshold value for anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in the diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in an Indian population. METHOD(S): A retrospective observational study was carried out on infertile women at the Department of Reproductive Medicine and Surgery at a tertiary hospital from January 2017 to November 2019. Serum AMH was analyzed with Access AMH chemiluminescent immunoassay. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to calculate the diagnostic threshold value of serum AMH in two age groups: 20-29 and 30-39 years. RESULT(S): Of 688 women, 200 (29.1%) were diagnosed with PCOS by the Rotterdam criteria: 98/282 (34.8%) aged 20-29 years and 102/406 (25.4%) aged 30-39 years. Mean serum AMH was 5.07 +/- 3.97 and 4.330 +/- 7.15 ng/ml in women aged 20-29 and 30-39 years, respectively. A threshold value of serum AMH above 3.75 ng/ml was predictive of PCOS by Youden's J statistics in the entire cohort, whereas it was 5.46 and 3.46 ng/ml in women aged 20-29 and 30-39 years, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Serum AMH of 5.46 and 3.46 ng/ml in women aged 20-29 and 30-39 years, respectively, can be used to diagnose PCOS when there is a diagnostic dilemma in the Rotterdam criteria.Copyright © 2020 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics

N2  - Background: The aims of this study were to compare the efficacy of different androgens measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in representing hyperandrogenemia and to evaluate adrenal-origin androgens with a dexamethasone suppression test in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): One hundred and two patients with PCOS and 41 healthy volunteers were recruited and total serum testosterone (TT), androstenedione (AD), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) were measured by LC-MS/MS. ROC analysis was performed to compare the efficacy of different androgens in representing hyperandrogenemia. Dexamethasone suppression test was performed in 51 patients with PCOS and above indicators were measured after dexamethasone administration. The prediction efficacy of DHEA and DHEA-S at baseline in the dexamethasone suppression test was evaluated with ROC analysis. Result(s): The AUCs of TT, AD, free androgen index (FAI) and DHEA-S in ROC analysis for representing hyperandrogenemia were 0.816, 0.842, 0.937 and 0.678, respectively. The optimal cutoff value of TT was 0.337 ng/ml, with a sensitivity of 72.0% and specificity of 82.93%. The optimal cutoff value for AD was 1.309 ng/ml, with a sensitivity of 81.0% and specificity of 73.17%. The optimal cutoff value of the FAI was 2.50, with a sensitivity of 87.0% and specificity of 92.68%. Alternatively, AD or FAI more than the optimal cutoff values as evidence of hyperandrogenemia had the highest sensitivity of 91.18%. The levels of cortisol, DHEA and DHEA-S were all suppressed to narrow ranges after dexamethasone administration. Nine and 8 of 51 patients with PCOS had significant decreases in TT and AD, respectively. DHEA can be used as a indicator for predicting significant decrease of TT in dexamethasone suppression test with cutoff value of 13.28 ng/ml. A total of 27.5% (14/51) of patients had DHEA-S excess, but only 1 of 9 patients who had a significant decrease in TT had elevated level of DHEA-S at baseline. Conclusion(s): AD measured by LC-MS/MS can represent hyperandrogenemia in PCOS patients and, combined with TT or FAI, can improve the screening efficiency of hyperandrogenemia. Seventeen percent of PCOS patients had adrenal-origin androgen dominance, with TT significantly decreasing after 2 days of dexamethasone administration. Adrenal-origin androgen dominance was not parallel with DHEA-S excess in patients with PCOS.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Objective: To determine whether a patient-specific predictive model combining antimullerian hormone (AMH) levels and body mass index (BMI) can aid in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and other ovulatory dysfunction disorders (OVDYS) among infertile women. Design(s): Retrospective cohort study. Setting(s): Academic fertility center. Patient(s): One thousand and ten infertile women undergoing 3,160 intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles, stratified by diagnosis in three groups: PCOS, OVDYS, and other etiologies. Intervention(s): Ovulation induction followed by IUI or ultrasound-monitored natural cycles. Main Outcome Measure(s): The probability of either PCOS or OVDYS diagnosis based on AMH levels alone and a patient-specific predictive model that combines serum AMH and patient's BMI. Result(s): Median and interquartile range (IQR) for the serum AMH levels (ng/mL) were the highest in women with PCOS, and lowest in those with other infertility causes. Overall, for every 1 ng/mL increase in AMH, the odds of PCOS and OVDYS versus other causes increased by 55% and 24%, respectively. Postestimation from multivariate logistic regression models showed that PCOS diagnosis can be predicted with lower AMH values in women with a higher BMI compared with the AMH values predicting PCOS in normal-weight or underweight patients. The receiver operating characteristic curves reinforced these findings, and the best cutoffs for PCOS diagnosis were 7.5, 4.4, and 4.1 ng/mL for women belonging to the BMI groups 18.5-24.9, 25.0-29.9, and >=30.0 kg/m2, respectively. Conclusion(s): Taking into account AMH and BMI, we developed a model that predicts the probability of an oligo-anovulation diagnosis, thus facilitating patient-specific counseling in the infertility setting.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - Relevance: The clinical picture of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is extremely polymorphic, especially in adolescence. At the same time, the diagnostic criteria of PCOS in adolescence are still under discussion, and the hormonal parameters, including anti-Mullerian hormone range and hyperandrogenism, are not determined. The aim of the present study was to characterize the pivotal clinical and hormonal features of PCOS in adolescents and to establish the age-specific thresholds of the most essential hormonal parameters. Design(s): A case-control study. Method(s): The study included 130 girls with PCOS according to the complete Rotterdam criteria, aged 15 to 17 years. The control group consisted of 30 healthy girls with a regular menstrual cycle of the same age. A complete clinical and laboratory examination, hormonal assays, and ultrasound of the pelvic organs were performed. The serums anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), LH/FSH, prolactin, estradiol, 17alpha-OH progesterone (17alpha-OHP), androstenedione, testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leptin, and free androgen index (FAI) were analyzed. The diagnostic accuracy of AMH, FAI, LH/FSH, T, and androstenedione levels in predicting PCOS in adolescents was established using a logistic regression model and calculating area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Result(s): The serum levels of LH (9.0 (5.4-13.8) vs. 3.7 (2.5-4.7) IU/L; p < 0.0001), LH/FSH (1.6 (1.0-2.3) vs. 0.7 (0.5-1.1); p < 0.0001), 17alpha-OHP (4.1 (3.2-5.1) vs. 3.4 (2.7-3.8) nmol/L; p = 0.0071), cortisol (464.0 +/- 147.6 vs. 284.0 +/- 129.7 nmol/L; p < 0.0001), prolactin (266.0 (175.0-405.0) vs. 189.0 (142.0-269.0) mIU/L; p = 0.0141), T (1.9 (1.2-2.5) vs. 0.8 (0.7-1.1) nmol/L; p < 0.0001), androstenedione (15.8 (11.6-23.2) vs. 8.3 (6.5-10.8) ng/mL; p < 0.0001), AMH (9.5 (7.5-14.9) vs. 5.8 (3.8-6.9) ng/mL; p < 0.0001), FAI (5.5 (2.8-7.0) vs. 1.6 (1.1-2.3); p < 0.0001), SHBG (37.0 (24.7-55.5) vs. 52.9 (39.0-67.6) nmol/L; p = 0.0136), DHEAS (6.8 +/- 3.2 vs. 5.1 +/- 1.5 mumol/L; p = 0.0039), and leptin (38.7 +/- 27.1 vs. 23.7 +/- 14.0 ng/mL; p = 0.0178) were significantly altered in the PCOS patients compared to the controls. Multivariate analysis of all studied hormonal and instrumental parameters of PCOS in adolescents revealed as the most essential: AMH level > 7.20 ng/mL, FAI > 2.75, androstenedione > 11.45 ng/mL, total T > 1.15 nmol/L, LH/FSH ratio > 1.23, and the volume of each ovary > 10.70 cm3 (for each criterion sensitivity >= 75.0-93.0%, specificity >= 83.0-93.0%). The diagnostic accuracy of PCOS determination was 90.2-91.6% with the combined use of either four detected indexes, which was significantly higher than the use of each index separately. The accuracy of. PCOS diagnostics reached 92% using AMH and leptin concentrations when the value of the logistic regression function [85.73 - (1.73 x AMH) - (0.12 x Leptin)] was less than 70.72. Conclusion(s): The results of the study estimate the threshold for AMH, FAI, androstenedione, testosterone, LH/FSH, and ovarian volume, which could be suggested for use in the PCOS diagnostics in adolescents with a high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the combination of either four determined indexes improved the diagnostic accuracy for the PCOS detection in adolescents.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Hirsutism is a distressing medical problem for women. Most of hirsutism in women is associated with excess androgen, and most cases have PCOS as an underlying cause.Which androgen to be used to evaluate clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS is still debated. There are a small number of studies that evaluated androgens in women with PCOS having hirsutism with conflicting results. The Objective of this study was to determine which androgen predict hirsutism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A case-control study was done in Faiha Specialized Diabetes, Endocrine, and Metabolism Center (FDEMC), Basrah, Iraq. A total of 130 women with PCOS (based on Rotterdam criteria) and 70 healthy controls of comparable age (16-40 years) were investigated for androgens (total testosterone, free testosterone, DHEA-S) using Electrochemiluminescence technology assay; excess hair was examined according to the modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) score and a cut-off value of 8 defined hirsutism. In the three groups of women, the first (n=100) included PCOS with hirsutism, the second (n=30) PCOS without hirsutism, and the third (n=70) women without PCOS or hirsutism as healthy control, hirsutism was seen in about 77 % of PCOS women mostly of moderate severity; High TT, FT, DHEA-S, and overall androgens were seen in 69%, 76%, 37%, and 99% respectively of our PCOS women with hirsutism. No correlation was found between TT, FT, and DHEA-S and the mFG score. This study provides evidence that presence of hirsutism in women with PCOS was associated with a higher level of biochemical hyperandrogenism than seen in PCOS without hirsutism; however, there was no correlation between the studied androgens and mFG score.Copyright © 2020 This is an Open Access article licensed under a Creative Commons license: Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with cardiometabolic disease, but recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of longitudinal studies that quantify these associations are lacking. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Is PCOS a risk factor for cardiometabolic disease? SEARCH METHODS: We searched from inception to September 2019 in MEDLINE and EMBASE using controlled terms (e.g. MESH) and text words for PCOS and cardiometabolic outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, myocardial infarction, hypertension (HT), type 2 diabetes (T2D), metabolic syndrome and dyslipidaemia. Cohort studies and case-control studies comparing the prevalence of T2D, HT, fatal or non-fatal CVD and/or lipid concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TGs) between women with and without PCOS of >=18 years of age were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies were eligible regardless of the degree to which they adjusted for confounders including obesity. Articles had to be written in English, German or Dutch. Intervention studies, animal studies, conference abstracts, studies with a follow-up duration less than 3 years and studies with less than 10 PCOS cases were excluded. Study selection, quality assessment (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. OUTCOME(S): Of the 5971 identified records, 23 cohort studies were included in the current systematic review. Women with PCOS had increased risks of HT (risk ratio (RR): 1.75, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.15), T2D (RR: 3.00, 95% CI 2.56 to 3.51), a higher serum concentration of TC (mean difference (MD): 7.14 95% CI 1.58 to 12.70 mg/dl), a lower serum concentration of HDL-C (MD: -2.45 95% CI -4.51 to -0.38 mg/dl) and increased risks of non-fatal cerebrovascular disease events (RR: 1.41, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.94) compared to women without PCOS. No differences were found for LDL-C (MD: 3.32 95% CI -4.11 to 10.75 mg/dl), TG (MD 18.53 95% CI -0.58 to 37.64 mg/dl) or coronary disease events (RR: 1.78, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.23). No meta-analyses could be performed for fatal CVD events due to the paucity of mortality data. WIDER IMPLICATION(S): Women with PCOS are at increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. This review quantifies this risk, which is important for clinicians to inform patients and to take into account in the cardiovascular risk assessment of women with PCOS. Future clinical trials are needed to assess the ability of cardiometabolic screening and management in women with PCOS to reduce future CVD morbidity.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis in adult female acne (AFA) is tough owing to unreliable ultrasonography in virgins or obese females and inconsistent hyperandrogenemia. We analyzed hormones in AFA and established a diagnostic cut-off value of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) for PCOS. Female acne patients aged >=25 years were assessed with total testosterone (TT), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), free androgen index (FAI), AMH, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). Rotterdam's criteria defined PCOS. AMH was measured (Access AMH assay) to calculate the diagnostic cut off value using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Of 120 cases, 25.83% had PCOS. This group had significant clinical hyperandrogenism, truncal and adolescent acne, polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM), and raised hormones (AMH, TT, FAI, LH, and LH/FSH). AMH levels were significantly higher in the PCOS group (6.91 +/- 3.85 ng/mL) and positively correlated with TT, FAI, 17OHP, LH, and LH/FSH ratio. AMH at >5.1 ng/mL (sensitivity-70.97% and specificity-82.02%) predicted PCOS and correlated with PCOM. AMH (>5.1 ng/mL) is useful for diagnosing PCOS and surrogate for hyperandrogenemia and PCOM. Its correlation with hormones in non PCOS AFA highlights its sensitivity to diagnose endocrinological derangements.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - Objective: Healthy lifestyle and adequate reproductive health knowledge are prerequisites for maintenance of physical and mental well-being of women across the world. With increasing prevalence of metabolic disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it is important that sufficient awareness of these issues is generated, especially in conservative communities in Arab regions. The main objective of this study is to assess reproductive health (RH) knowledge and awareness of PCOS among female Emirati students and also to explore their lifestyle choices. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 493 Emirati students were recruited based on convenience sampling and completed a survey containing questions related to demography, lifestyle preferences, RH knowledge, and PCOS awareness. Result(s): Of the students, 13% self-reported being diagnosed with PCOS, with 3.5% also taking medication for the same, 6% reported having high androgen levels, 30.7% reported polymenorrhea, and 3.5% reported oligomenorrhea for frequency of menstrual cycle. Also, 12.4% students experienced abnormal bleeding (heavy/none) during menstruation and 24% reported excessive body hair. It was found that 4.3% of students were taking medication for hyperglycemia and 75% of students reported a family history of diabetes. Students displayed low reproductive health knowledge and poor awareness of PCOS. Lifestyle preferences indicated low physical activity and high indulgence in fast food. Conclusion(s): Lifestyle choices adopted by Emirati University students may predispose them to disorders such as PCOS. Early detection and management of PCOS coupled with a dynamic awareness campaign for RH can help in improving fertility rates of Emirati women. The study identifies major gaps in knowledge and awareness of RH and PCOS in Emirati women that need to be addressed by creating a culturally congruent heathcare policy with emphasis on education and health promotion. Mandatory PA programs and increasing availability of healthy eating options in campus should be considered by all universities, particularly in Arab regions, for improving lifestyle and preventing metabolic disorders in young students.Copyright © 2020 Pramodh.

N2  - Purpose: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a risk factor for the development of endometrial cancer (EC). To the present authors' knowledge, no study has clarified whether pre-existing PCOS is a prognostic factor for post-surgical EC recurrences. The aim of this study was to determine whether pre-existing PCOS is a risk factor for the recurrence of EC even after the surgical treatment of EC in premenopausal women. Material(s) and Method(s): The authors performed a retrospective cohort study on premenopausal EC patients aged 50 years or younger who underwent surgery at this hospital between 2009 and 2013. The median follow-up period was 65.5 months. Result(s): Of 46 patients with EC, nine (19.6%) had PCOS. Four of the nine PCOS patients developed recurrence of EC, three of whom died of the disease, whereas only one of 37 patients who did not have PCOS developed EC recurrence (44.4% and 2.7%, respectively; p = 0.003). Univariate analysis showed that the progression-free and overall survival of the patients with pre-existing PCOS was worse than that of patients without pre-existing PCOS (p = 0.008 and p = 0.029, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that PCOS was a poor prognostic factor for progression-free survival and a marginal poor prognostic factor for overall survival (p = 0.011 and p = 0.061, respectively). Conclusion(s): Pre-existing PCOS was a risk factor for recurrence in premenopausal post-operative patients with EC aged 50 years or younger.Copyright ©2020 Uehara et al.

N2  - Context: The knowledge of normal variation of reproductive hormones, internal genitalia imaging, and the prevalence of gynecological disorders in adolescent girls is limited. Objective(s): The study aimed to describe reproductive parameters in postmenarchal girls from the general population including the frequency of oligomenorrhea, polycystic ovary syndrome, and use of hormonal contraception. Design(s): The Copenhagen Mother-Child Cohort is a population-based longitudinal birth cohort of 1210 girls born between 1997 and 2002. Setting(s): University hospital. Participant(s): A total of 317 girls were included, with a median age of 16.1 years and time since menarche of 2.9 years. Main Outcome Measure(s): Tanner stage, height, weight, age at menarche, menstrual cycle length and regularity, ovarian/uterine volume, and number of follicles were recorded. Serum concentrations of FSH, LH, anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), inhibin B, estradiol, testosterone, SHBG, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, 17-OH-progesterone, and IGF-1 were measured. Result(s): Twenty girls (6.3%) had oligomenorrhea and differed significantly in serum androgens and AMH, age at and time since menarche from girls with regular cycles. Twenty-seven girls were classified with PCOS (8.5%) and had significantly higher 17-OH-progesterone, estradiol, AMH, LH, and age at menarche than the reference group. Girls on oral contraception had significantly higher serum SHBG concentrations and lower serum concentrations of all hormones except AMH and IGF-1. Ovarian follicles 2 to 29.9 mm correlated positively with serum AMH (P < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): Most 16-year-old girls had regular menstrual cycles, normal reproductive hormones, and uterine and ovarian ultrasound. Serum AMH reflected ovarian follicle count and may be a useful biomarker of ovarian reserve.Copyright © endocrine society 2020. all rights reserved.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: Is high adiposity in childhood associated with menstrual irregularity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in later life? SUMMARY ANSWER: Overall, greater childhood BMI was associated with menstrual irregularity, and greater childhood BMI and waist/height ratio (WHtR) in white but not black participants were associated with PCOS in adulthood. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Increased childhood BMI has been associated with irregular menstrual cycles and PCOS symptoms in adulthood in two longitudinal population-based studies, but no study has reported on associations with childhood abdominal obesity. Few studies have investigated whether there are racial differences in the associations of adiposity with PCOS though there has been some suggestion that associations with high BMI may be stronger in white girls than in black girls. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study included 1516 participants (aged 26-41 years) from the Australian Childhood Determinants of Adult Health study (CDAH) and 1247 participants (aged 26-57 years) from the biracial USA Babies substudy of the Bogalusa Heart Study (BBS) who were aged 7-15 years at baseline. At follow-up, questions were asked about menstruation (current for CDAH or before age 40 years for BBS), ever having had a diagnosis of PCOS and symptoms of PCOS. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In CDAH, a single childhood visit was conducted in 1985. In BBS, multiple childhood visits occurred from 1973 to 2000 and race was reported (59% white; 41% black). In childhood, overweight and obesity were defined by international age-sex-specific standards for BMI and WHtR was considered as an indicator of abdominal obesity. Multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression estimated relative risks (RRs) adjusting for childhood age, highest parental and own education and age at menarche. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The prevalence of childhood obesity was 1.1% in CDAH and 7.5% in BBS. At followup, menstrual irregularity was reported by 16.7% of CDAH and 24.5% of BBS participants. The prevalence of PCOS was 7.4% in CDAH and 8.0% in BBS participants. In CDAH, childhood obesity was associated with menstrual irregularity (RR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.63-4.96) and PCOS (RR = 4.05, 95% CI: 1.10-14.83) in adulthood. With each 0.01 unit increase in childhood WHtR there was a 6% (95% CI: 1-11%) greater likelihood of PCOS. Overall, in BBS, childhood obesity was associated with increased risk of menstrual irregularity (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.08-1.92) in adulthood. Significant interaction effects between race and childhood adiposity were detected in associations with PCOS. In BBS white participants, childhood obesity was associated with PCOS (RR = 2.93, 95% CI: 1.65-5.22) and a 0.01 unit increase in childhood WHtR was associated with an 11% (95% CI: 5-17%) greater likelihood of PCOS in adulthood. In BBS black participants, no statistically significant associations of childhood adiposity measures with PCOS were observed. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The classification of menstrual irregularity and PCOS was based on self-report by questionnaire, which may have led to misclassification of these outcomes. However, despite the limitations of the study, the prevalence of menstrual irregularity and PCOS in the two cohorts was consistent with the literature. While the study samples at baseline were population-based, loss to follow-up means the generalizability of the findings is uncertain. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Greater childhood adiposity indicates a higher risk of menstrual irregularity and PCOS in adulthood. Whether this is causal or an early indicator of underlying hormonal or metabolic disorders needs clarification. The stronger associations of adiposity with PCOS in white than black participants suggest that there are racial differences in childhood adiposity predisposing to the development of PCOS and other environmental or genetic factors are also important. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The CDAH study was supported by grants from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (grants 211316, 544923 and 1128373). The Bogalusa Heart Study is supported by US National Institutes of Health grants R01HD069587, AG16592, HL121230, HD032194 and P50HL015103.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: Does the inheritance of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphism affect the phenotype of offspring? SUMMARY ANSWER: Male offspring who inherit PCOS-related genetic variations from PCOS mothers were more susceptible to developing the metabolic abnormality in their later life. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Genetic factors are considered the major etiology of PCOS. Previous studies have highlighted that offspring of women with PCOS had an increased risk of the same disease or PCOS-like symptoms. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study involved 172 children born to women with PCOS and 529 children born to non-PCOS women. All offspring were conceived by assisted reproductive technologies. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The offspring ranged from 1 to 8 years old. Metabolic phenotype analyses were performed in offspring aged from 2 to 8 (N 1/4 619). Sanger sequencing, TaqMan and Sequenom MassARRAY were used to sequence the samples. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In male offspring, the fasting insulin (FINS) (P 1/4 0.037) homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (P 1/4 0.038) and the homeostasis model assessment of pancreatic beta-cell function (HOMA-b) (P 1/4 0.038) levels were higher in offspring of PCOS mothers compared to controls. In female offspring, PCOS offspring had a significantly higher anti-Mullerian hormone levels (P 1/4 0.001) compared to those from control mothers. In male offspring of PCOS mothers, subjects with a T allele at rs2349415 in the gene FSHR had higher FINS (P 1/4 0.023), HOMA-IR (P 1/4 0.030) and HOMA-b levels (P 1/4 0.013) than those in the homozygous CC group. The same increased trend in FINS, HOMA-IR and HOMA-b levels could be found in the CC and TC group in rs2268361 located in gene FSHR compared to the TT group (P 1/4 0.029, P 1/4 0.030, P 1/4 0.046, respectively). As for rs10818854 in the DENND1A gene, the AA and AG group had a higher FINS (P 1/4 0.037) and HOMA-b (P 1/4 0.008) levels than the homozygous CC group. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Firstly, the offspring may be too young to see any phenotype changes. Secondly, this study only analyzed the differences of genotype frequency using the dominant model instead of all three models due to the limited sample size of the homozygous model. The results, therefore, should be replicated and performed in a larger sample size population. Thirdly, environmental impacts cannot be ruled out. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The findings presented in this thesis add to our understanding the changes in offspring born to PCOS women and remind us to consider early intervention to avoid more severe effects.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - Research question: Is the sole measurement of total testosterone sufficient to assess the presence of hyperandrogenism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? Design: Serum samples from 294 patients with PCOS who met the Rotterdam criteria were used for the analysis of total testosterone by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA). The free androgen index (FAI) was calculated as total testosterone (TT)/sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) x 100%, and the presence/degree of hirsutism were assessed using the modified and simplified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG and sFG, respectively) scoring systems. Result(s): The hirsute subjects presented higher LC-MS/MS-based total testosterone and FAI values than the non-hirsute subjects (all P < 0.001), including those defined based on mFG >=5 or sFG >=3. Total testosterone and FAI were both positively correlated with the mFG (rank correlation coefficient [RCC] 0.598 and 0.443, P < 0.001) or sFG (RCC 0.747 and 0.568, P < 0.001) score, and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that both parameters could significantly predict the presence of hirsutism determined by the mFG (area under the curve [AUC] 0.797 and 0.725, P < 0.001) or sFG (AUC 0.894 and 0.817, P < 0.001) score. However, similar results were not obtained with the CLIA platform. Conclusion(s): In this East Asian population, total testosterone was found to be a strong predictor of the presence and degree of hyperandrogenism (i.e. assessed by the presence and degree of hirsutism), but this finding was obtained only if the total testosterone level was measured by LC-MS/MS and not by CLIA. These findings might have important implications for global epidemiologic, phenotypic and clinical studies of PCOS.Copyright © 2020 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: Is high adiposity in childhood associated with menstrual irregularity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in later life? SUMMARY ANSWER: Overall, greater childhood BMI was associated with menstrual irregularity, and greater childhood BMI and waist/height ratio (WHtR) in white but not black participants were associated with PCOS in adulthood. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Increased childhood BMI has been associated with irregular menstrual cycles and PCOS symptoms in adulthood in two longitudinal population-based studies, but no study has reported on associations with childhood abdominal obesity. Few studies have investigated whether there are racial differences in the associations of adiposity with PCOS though there has been some suggestion that associations with high BMI may be stronger in white girls than in black girls. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study included 1516 participants (aged 26-41 years) from the Australian Childhood Determinants of Adult Health study (CDAH) and 1247 participants (aged 26-57 years) from the biracial USA Babies substudy of the Bogalusa Heart Study (BBS) who were aged 7-15 years at baseline. At follow-up, questions were asked about menstruation (current for CDAH or before age 40 years for BBS), ever having had a diagnosis of PCOS and symptoms of PCOS. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In CDAH, a single childhood visit was conducted in 1985. In BBS, multiple childhood visits occurred from 1973 to 2000 and race was reported (59% white; 41% black). In childhood, overweight and obesity were defined by international age-sex-specific standards for BMI and WHtR was considered as an indicator of abdominal obesity. Multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression estimated relative risks (RRs) adjusting for childhood age, highest parental and own education and age at menarche. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The prevalence of childhood obesity was 1.1% in CDAH and 7.5% in BBS. At followup, menstrual irregularity was reported by 16.7% of CDAH and 24.5% of BBS participants. The prevalence of PCOS was 7.4% in CDAH and 8.0% in BBS participants. In CDAH, childhood obesity was associated with menstrual irregularity (RR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.63-4.96) and PCOS (RR = 4.05, 95% CI: 1.10-14.83) in adulthood. With each 0.01 unit increase in childhood WHtR there was a 6% (95% CI: 1-11%) greater likelihood of PCOS. Overall, in BBS, childhood obesity was associated with increased risk of menstrual irregularity (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.08-1.92) in adulthood. Significant interaction effects between race and childhood adiposity were detected in associations with PCOS. In BBS white participants, childhood obesity was associated with PCOS (RR = 2.93, 95% CI: 1.65-5.22) and a 0.01 unit increase in childhood WHtR was associated with an 11% (95% CI: 5-17%) greater likelihood of PCOS in adulthood. In BBS black participants, no statistically significant associations of childhood adiposity measures with PCOS were observed. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The classification of menstrual irregularity and PCOS was based on self-report by questionnaire, which may have led to misclassification of these outcomes. However, despite the limitations of the study, the prevalence of menstrual irregularity and PCOS in the two cohorts was consistent with the literature. While the study samples at baseline were population-based, loss to follow-up means the generalizability of the findings is uncertain. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Greater childhood adiposity indicates a higher risk of menstrual irregularity and PCOS in adulthood. Whether this is causal or an early indicator of underlying hormonal or metabolic disorders needs clarification. The stronger associations of adiposity with PCOS in white than black participants suggest that there are racial differences in childhood adiposity predisposing to the development of PCOS and other environmental or genetic factors are also important.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - Background Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women. Women with PCOS have androgen excess as a defining feature. They also have increased insulin resistance and obesity, which are also risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, published data regarding PCOS as independent risk factor for NAFLD remain controversial. Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate the association between PCOS and NAFLD using a large national database. Methods We identified adult female patients (>=18 years) with PCOS using the National Inpatient Sample database between 2002 and 2014. The control group included patients who did not have a diagnosis of PCOS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to study the association of NAFLD with PCOS. Results Out of a total of 50 785 354 women, 77 415 (0.15%) had PCOS. These patients were younger (32.7 vs 54.8; p<0.001) and more likely to be obese (29.4% vs 8.6%; p<0.001) compared with non-PCOS patients. However, the PCOS group had less hypertension (23.2% vs 39.8%), dyslipidaemia (12% vs 17.8%) and diabetes mellitus (18.1% vs 18.3%) (p<0.001 for all). Using multivariate logistic regression, patients with PCOS had significantly higher rate of NAFLD (OR 4.30, 95% CI 4.11 to 4.50, p<0.001). Conclusion Our study showed that patients with PCOS have four times higher risk of developing NAFLD compared with women without PCOS. Further studies are needed to assess if specific PCOS treatments can affect NAFLD progression.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The increased secretion of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) by the growing follicles has been supposed as a determinative feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The diagnostic performance of AMH in PCOS is superior compared to the free androgen index (FAI) and luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) quotient. We established age-dependent reference ranges to further improve the diagnostic performance of AMH. In a cross-sectional study, in samples of 4712 reproductive age patients, ranging from 14 to 50 years, BMI, AMH and other reproductive hormones were determined by immunoassay or tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to calculate age-specific reference ranges and the diagnostic performance. Age-specific diagnostic performances for Elecsys AMH, FAI and LH/FSH ratio were established in the reference group. No significant difference in BMI was found between the groups. AMH values were significantly negatively correlated with age (r =-0.628, p < 0.001) in patients with normal ovarian function, but there was no correlation between age and AMH levels in PCOS patients (r =-0.041, p < 0.174). In all the study groups, AMH showed a weak correlation between FAI and LH/FSH ratio (r = 0.302, p < 0.001 and r = 0.434, p < 0.001, respectively). The sensitivity/specificity for AMH, FAI and LH/FSH ratio were 89/96%, 71/69% and 75/72%, respectively, according to the Youden index. We determined the age-dependent reference ranges for serum AMH levels in a large population-based study and calculated the age-specific diagnostic performance of FAI and LH/FSH ratio, which allows physicians to evaluate patients with PCOS who have normal AMH levels. AMH is suggested as the strongest diagnostic marker in patients with PCOS compared to FAI and LH/FSH ratio.Copyright © 2020 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition of androgen excess in women, is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors; however, this association is not fully characterized in a population-based sample of premenopausal women and high-risk groups such as Hispanics/Latinas. Objective(s): We examined the association of PCOS signs and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in premenopausal Hispanic/Latina women. Method(s): This cross-sectional analysis includes 1427 women age 24 to 44 years from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. PCOS signs included menstrual cycle greater than 35 days or irregular, self-reported PCOS, and oral contraceptive use to regulate periods or acne, and a composite of 1 or more PCOS signs. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI for MetS, accounting for sociodemographic factors and the complex survey design; an additional model included body mass index (BMI). Result(s): The mean age was 34 years and 30% reported any PCOS sign. The odds of MetS were higher in women reporting cycles greater than 35 days or irregular (OR 1.63; CI: 1.07-2.49) vs cycles 24 to 35 days, self-reported PCOS (OR 2.49; CI: 1.38-4.50) vs no PCOS, and any PCOS sign (OR 1.58; CI: 1.10-2.26) vs none. We found no association between OC use to regulate periods or acne and MetS (OR 1.1; CI: 0.6-1.8). When adjusting for BMI, only the association of self-reported PCOS and MetS was attenuated (OR 1.78; CI: 0.92-3.44). Conclusion(s): In Hispanic/Latina women, irregular menstrual cycles, self-reported PCOS, and any PCOS sign were associated with MetS and could indicate women at metabolic disease risk.Copyright © 2020 Endocrine Society 2020.

N2  - Background: Obesity is a common risk factor for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Both PCOS and OSA are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Hence, it is important to determine the burden of OSA in women with PCOS. Method(s): We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, OpenGrey, CENTRAL), conference abstracts, and reference lists of relevant articles, up to January 2019. No restriction for language or publication status. Studies that examined the presence of OSA in women with PCOS using polysomnography and/or level III devices were eligible for inclusion. Result(s): Seventeen studies involving 648 participants were included. Our meta-analysis showed that 35.0% (95% CI 22.2-48.9%) of women with PCOS had OSA. This prevalence was not affected by variation in PCOS definition between studies. Approximately one-tenth of the variation in OSA prevalence was related to differences in study population (higher in adults than adolescents and mixed populations), and around one-tenth was related to sample size (higher in smaller studies). OSA prevalence was markedly higher in obese versus lean women with PCOS, and in women with PCOS compared to controls (odds ratio = 3.83, 95% CI 1.43-10.24, eight studies, 957 participants (349 PCOS and 608 controls)). However, most of the studies were at high risk of selection bias, did not account for important confounders, included predominantly women with class II obesity, and were conducted in one country (USA). Conclusion(s): Future studies need to examine the true prevalence of OSA in a more representative sample of women with PCOS. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the prevalence of OSA in women with PCOS and obesity is high and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion of OSA in these women.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).

N2  - Objective: To establish the age-specific centiles of serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in Chinese women, and to explore the use of multiples of median (MoM) AMH levels for the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): An observational study. Setting(s): University-affiliated hospitals and community clinics. Population: We included 3137 healthy women aged 20-44 years recruited prospectively or who had archived serum samples from previous research projects. Another validation cohort of 751 women with PCOS as well as ovulatory controls, which was a convenient sample of women attending for infertility or menstrual disorders, was also studied. Method(s): The serum samples were assayed for AMH by the automated Access AMH assay. Main Outcome Measure(s): Age-specific reference ranges were constructed on the primary cohort with the Lambda-Mu-Sigma method. The MoM AMH of each subject in the validation cohort was calculated. Result(s): Centile curves of serum AMH level against age were established. MoM AMH was significantly higher in women with PCOS than in controls (P < 0.05). The area under the ROC curve was 0.852 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.825-0.877) (P < 0.0001) for discriminating women with PCOS from ovulatory controls by MoM AMH. Conclusion(s): We established a set of year-by-year age-specific reference ranges of serum AMH levels in Chinese women. The MoM AMH derived from this set of reference ranges is a promising tool to replace antral follicle count in the diagnosis of PCOS. Tweetable abstract: A set of age-specific reference ranges of AMH levels was established in Chinese women. Multiples of median AMH may be used to diagnose PCOS.Copyright © 2020 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder with heterogeneous clinical manifestations. Current evidence suggests that women with PCOS exhibit an unfavorable metabolic profile which may pose them at increased risk for cardiovascular events later in life. Areas covered: Herein, we present a review of the existing literature relating to PCOS and long-term cardiovascular (CV) health risks in women after menopause. We performed an electronic-based search with the use of PubMed from 1990 to August 2019 and systematically reviewed studies assessing CV events in women with PCOS. We aimed to outline the gaps in the current evidence and suggest areas for future research. Expert opinion: Although there is a clear association between PCOS and cardiometabolic dysfunction, data on actual cardiovascular disease (CVD) events are conflicting. Additional large, prospective cohort studies of well-phenotyped women with PCOS and long-term follow-up into the late menopause are needed to elucidate the true CVD risk in this population.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Objectives: Contradictory results have been reported regarding the association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We assessed the cardiometabolic phenotype and prevalence of CVD in middle-aged women with PCOS, compared with age-matched controls from the general population, and estimated 10-year CVD risk and cardiovascular health score. Design(s): A cross-sectional study. Participant(s): 200 women aged >45 with PCOS, and 200 age-matched controls. Measurements: Anthropometrics, insulin, lipid levels, prevalence of metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes. Ten-year Framingham risk score and the cardiovascular health score were calculated, and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured. Result(s): Mean age was 50.5 years (SD = 5.5) in women with PCOS and 51.0 years (SD = 5.2) in controls. Increased waist circumference, body mass index and hypertension were more often observed in women with PCOS (P <.001). In women with PCOS, the prevalence of type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome was not significantly increased and lipid levels were not different from controls. cIMT was lower in women with PCOS (P <.001). Calculated cardiovascular health and 10-year CVD risk were similar in women with PCOS and controls. Conclusion(s): Middle-aged women with PCOS exhibit only a moderately unfavourable cardiometabolic profile compared to age-matched controls, even though they present with an increased BMI and waist circumference. Furthermore, we found no evidence for increased (10-year) CVD risk or more severe atherosclerosis compared with controls from the general population. Long-term follow-up of women with PCOS is necessary to provide a definitive answer concerning long-term risk for CVD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

N2  - This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence (P)/hazard ratio (HR) of cardiovascular (CV) events among reproductive age and menopausal age women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in comparison with healthy controls. PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of science, and Google scholar were searched for retrieving observational studies published up to April 2018 investigating CV events in patients with PCOS. The primary outcomes were a composite outcome of CV events [including coronary arterial disease (CAD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), myocardial infarction (MI), angina, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease] and mortality due to CV events; secondary outcomes were specific CVD events, including cerebrovascular disease, CAD, CVD, MI, angina, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke. In this meta-analysis, both fixed and random effect models were used. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored by meta-regression and subgroup analyses. Sixteen studies including 12 population-based were analyzed for the meta-analysis. Results showed that the pooled HRs of CV events in PCOS patients of reproductive age and in menopausal/aging women were higher than healthy controls (pooled HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.12-1.71) and (pooled HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.15, 2.04), respectively. Compared to healthy controls, analysis of population-based studies revealed that the HR of CV events increased only in reproductive age PCOS patients (1.43-fold, 95% CI: 1.27, 1.61), whereas the difference was not statistically significant when comparing menopausal/aging PCOS patients to healthy controls (1.03-fold, 95% CI: 0.41, 2.59). Sufficient data were not available for comparing the HRs of mortality due to CV events between the two PCOS age groups. Mainly based on population-based study, we found a greater risk of CV events in reproductive aged but not in menopausal/aging PCOS women, suggesting that having a history of PCOS during reproductive ages may not be an important risk factor for developing events in later life. This is a preliminary assumption and needs to be reevaluated by further comprehensive cohort studies of longer duration, initiated in the reproductive period, considering all known CVD risk factors.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the advantages of using anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): We compared data from 56 Han Chinese patients with PCOS and 52 female control Han Chinese individuals in terms of biochemical markers and the antral follicle count (AFC). Then, the correlation between serum AMH levels and various endocrine and metabolic factors was analyzed. We generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to assess the usefulness of AMH, AFC, the luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone (LH/FSH) ratio, and testosterone (T), to discriminate between the PCOS and control groups. Result(s): The LH/FSH ratio, homeostatis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), testosterone (T), blood glucose (Glu), triglyceride (TG), body mass index (BMI), AFC and, in particular, serum AMH level were significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the control group (P <.05; P <.001). The serum AMH level had a significant positive effect on the likelihood of AFC changes in patients with PCOS and control-group women. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of AMH, AFC, LH/FSH ratio, and T were 0.952, 0.778, 0.760, and 0.665, respectively. The best cutoff point for AMH was 6.09 ng per mL, with sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 88%.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Clinical Pathology 2018. All rights reserved.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex polygenic endocrine disorder. Familial clustering of phenotype has been known and it endorses the heritability of the disease. Among brothers of women with PCOS, we found significantly higher waist circumference, elevated blood pressure and insulin resistance when compared with age and BMI matched controls. Serum DHEAS level (6.2 vs. 4.5 mumol/L) was also significantly elevated among brothers. These findings in Indian ethnicity are concordant with previous studies and emphasize the need for counseling the first-degree family members of women with PCOS for lifestyle modification to reduce future risk of metabolic syndrome. We reiterate that insulin resistance (independent of obesity) and DHEAS may represent a PCOS phenotype. Funding agency-intramural grant Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences.

N2  - Objective was to evaluate serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and in its different phenotypes in relation to clinical, endocrine and metabolic parameters using a new automated VIDAS method and to compare it with the Gen II method. Study design was multi-center study including 319 PCOS women and 109 healthy controls. Serum AMH levels measured using VIDAS were significantly higher in PCOS women than controls (p <.001), and they correlated with those measured using the AMH Gen II method. An AMH cutoff value of 42.1 pmol/L distinguished PCOS women from controls with 67% sensitivity and 83% specificity. The PCOS women with three Rotterdam criteria or hyperandrogenism displayed significantly higher AMH levels compared with those with two Rotterdam criteria or normoandrogenism. In PCOS, AMH levels correlated positively with luteinizing hormone (LH), androgen and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and negatively with BMI, abdominal obesity, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), fasting glucose and insulin, and insulin resistance. In conclusion, AMH evaluated using the VIDAS method distinguished PCOS patients from healthy controls relatively well, especially in those with more severe phenotypes. Further studies are needed to establish whether AMH measurements can distinguish PCOS patients with different metabolic risk factors.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Objective: To determine optimal criteria for polycystic ovary morphology. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Setting(s): Multidisciplinary polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) clinic at a tertiary academic center. Patient(s): Subjects with PCOS were seen between 2006 and 2015 and met PCOS 1992 National Institutes of Health criteria. Controls were from the Ovarian Aging (OVA) study (2006-2011), a longitudinal study including healthy women with regular menstrual cycles. Intervention(s): Clinical data collection. Main Outcome Measure(s): Follicle number per ovary (FNPO) and ovarian volume (OV). Result(s): A total of 245 subjects with PCOS and 756 OVA study subjects were included in the FNPO analysis and had a mean (+/- SD) FNPO of 22.6 +/- 12.4 and 10 +/- 5.3, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic curves were created for both FNPO and OV and analyzed across age group categories (25 to <30, 30 to <35, and 35 to <40 years). Youden's and minimum distance (d) were used to compare efficacies of FNPO and OV thresholds. The optimal threshold for distinguishing PCOS from OVA controls was FNPO > 13. There was a decreasing trend in FNPO threshold with increasing age group (>15, >14, and >12, respectively). A total of 297 PCOS subjects and 756 OVA study subjects were included in the OV analysis and had a mean maximum OV of 10 +/- 5 cm3 and 6.5 +/- 5 cm3, respectively. The overall threshold was OV > 6.75 cm3, with a trend toward decreasing OV with increase in age group (>8.5, >7, and >6.25 cm3, respectively). Conclusion(s): Our findings reflect that age-stratified thresholds demonstrate superior diagnostic performance, with an improved balance of sensitivity and specificity compared with a single threshold. We propose age-specific thresholds for better diagnostic performance.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - Background: The risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (dysglycemia) may be increased in women with PCOS. Whether an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) should be performed routinely in all PCOS women at presentation or should be recommended only to a selected subset of patients is still controversial. Basic Procedures: At a tertiary care center, we conducted a retrospective, observational study including 400 women with PCOS submitted to an OGTT. Our primary objective was to assess the diagnostic agreement between two algorithms commonly used for the screening of dysglycemia in these women: i) relying only on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or ii) considering both fasting and/or 120-min plasma glucose concentrations during an OGTT. We conducted the analysis considering all patients as a whole, and also after stratifying them by body weight, androgen concentrations and age. Main Findings: The OGTT detected dysglycemia in 24.5% of patients, whereas only 14.3% women would have been diagnosed using FPG levels alone. The latter missed as many as 40% of women with dysglycemia in our series, including all cases of diabetes. Diagnostic agreement between both algorithms was only 0.55 (kappa = 0.103; 95% CI: 0.05-0.16). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for dysglycemia were 0.86 (95%CI: 0.81-0.91) for FPG and 0.91 (95%CI = 0.87-0.95) for 120-min plasma glucose during the OGTT. FPG was not accurate in predicting dysglycemia in women with PCOS regardless of the presence of insulin resistance, weight excess, hyperandrogenemia and age. Principal Conclusion(s): Relying on FPG alone is not adequate for the screening of disorders of glucose tolerance in women with PCOS; such diagnosis should rely on the results of an OGTT regardless of age, weight and/or androgen concentrations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Result(s): Compared to nonobese controls, nonobese women with PCOS showed a higher prevalence of hyperinsulinemia (odds ratio [OR], 36.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.76-747.12), IR (OR, 5.70; 95% CI 1.46-22.32), IGT (OR, 3.42; 95% CI 1.56-7.52), T2DM (OR, 1.47; 95% CI 1.11-1.93), hypertriglyceridemia (OR, 10.46; 95% CI 1.39-78.56), low-HDL (OR, 4.03; 95% CI 1.26-12.95), and Mets (OR, 2.57; 95% CI 1.30-5.07). No significant difference was observed for IFG, pre-DM, dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. In subgroup analysis, Whites exhibited increased risks of IR, IGT, IFG, T2DM, hypertension, and Mets, whereas no significant metabolic change was found in Asians. No study reported specifically an incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, cerebrovascular accident, arterial occlusive disease, and coronary heart disease in nonobese women with PCOS. Conclusion(s): Nonobese women with PCOS also suffer from metabolic disturbances and the risk of long-term metabolic complications. Further efforts should be made to elucidate underlying mechanisms and possible interventions in the early phase.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased metabolic risk, though data on long-term follow-up of cardiometabolic traits are limited. We postulated that Chinese women with PCOS would have higher risk of incident diabetes and cardiometabolic abnormalities than those without PCOS during long-term follow-up. Methods and findings: One hundred ninety-nine Chinese women with PCOS diagnosed by the Rotterdam criteria and with a mean age of 41.2 years (SD = 6.4) completed a follow-up evaluation after an average of 10.6 +/- 1.3 years. Two hundred twenty-five women without PCOS (mean age: 54.1 +/- 6.7 years) who underwent baseline and follow-up evaluation over the same period were used for comparison. Progression of glycaemic status of women both with and without PCOS was assessed by using 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) screening with the adoption of 2009 American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria. The frequency of impaired glucose regulation, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia of women with PCOS at follow- up has increased from 31.7% (95% CI 25.2%-38.1%) to 47.2% (95% CI 40.3%- 54.2%), 16.1% (95% CI 11.0%-21.2%) to 34.7% (95% CI 28.1%-41.3%), and 52.3% (95% CI 45.3%-59.2%) to 64.3% (95% CI 57.7%-71.0%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in follow-up women with PCOS is 26.1% (95% CI 20.0%-32.2%), almost double that in the cohort of women without PCOS (p < 0.001). Age-standardised incidence of diabetes among women with PCOS was 22.12 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 10.86-33.37) compared with the local female population incidence rate of 8.76 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 8.72-8.80) and 10.09 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 4.92-15.26, p < 0.001) for women without PCOS in our study. Incidence rate for women with PCOS aged 30-39 years was 20.56 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 12.57-31.87), which is approximately 10-fold higher than that of the age-matched general female population in Hong Kong (1.88 per 1,000 person-years, [95% CI 1.85-1.92]). The incidence rate of type 2 DM (T2DM) of both normal-weight and overweight women with PCOS was around double that of corresponding control groups (normal weight: 8.96 [95% CI 3.92-17.72] versus 4.86 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI 2.13-9.62], p > 0.05; overweight/obese: 28.64 [95% CI 19.55-40.60] versus 14.1 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI 8.20-22.76], p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis identified that baseline waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratio [OR] = 1.71 [95% CI 1.08- 2.69], p < 0.05) and elevated triglyceride (OR = 6.63 [95% CI 1.23-35.69], p < 0.05) are associated with the progression to T2DM in PCOS. Limitations of this study include moderate sample size with limited number of incident diabetes during follow-up period and potential selection bias. Conclusion(s): High risk of diabetes and increased cardiovascular disease risk factors among Chinese women with PCOS are highlighted in this long-term follow-up study. Diabetes onset was, on average, 10 years earlier among women with PCOS than in women without PCOS.Copyright © 2019 Ng et al.

N2  - Study Objective: To evaluate characteristics of young women with endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. Design(s): Retrospective chart review. Setting(s): Tertiary care referral center. Participants, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measure(s): We included 10- to 25-year-old young women seen at a single institution between 2006 and 2017 with International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th revision codes for endometrial cancer or hyperplasia (cases), or who underwent an endometrial biopsy with other benign pathologic diagnoses (controls). Exclusions included a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. Comparisons were made using chi2, Fisher exact, and nonparametric Wilcoxon rank tests. Result(s): Sixty-nine patients were identified: 13 cases, 54 controls, and 2 exclusions. Of the 13 cases, 3 had endometrial cancer, 5 had complex atypical hyperplasia (now called endometrioid intraepithelial neoplasia), and 5 had hyperplasia without atypia. A higher proportion of cases had a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30, compared with controls (76.9% vs 40.4%; P < .03). The proportion of patients who had a BMI greater than 30 and were smokers was significantly higher among cases (38.5% vs 9.3%; P < .02). The proportion of patients with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and smoking was also significantly different between groups (30.8% vs 3.7%; P < .01). Conclusion(s): In women aged 25 years and younger with endometrial sampling, a BMI greater than 30 was statistically more common in patients with endometrioid intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer. Although smoking or PCOS alone was not related to endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in this small cohort study, there might be a relationship between endometrial abnormalities and multiple exposures, including smoking and BMI greater than 30 or smoking and a history of PCOS.Copyright © 2019 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology

N2  - Objective: To better characterize the metabolic alterations in various phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in a large homogeneous (Sicilian) Mediterranean population with a low prevalence of obesity. Design(s): Retrospective study. Patient(s): A total of 1215 consecutively evaluated women with PCOS divided into four Rotterdam phenotypes (A, B, C and D) and in 108 matched ovulatory, nonhyperandrogenic women. Measurements: BMI, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and an oral glucose tolerance test. Result(s): The overall prevalence of obesity was 31%, metabolic syndrome 6.6%, diabetes 2.1%, altered glucose metabolism 13.1%, and abnormal lipid profile 60%. Phenotype B had the highest prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, altered glucose metabolism and lipid abnormalities compared to other PCOS phenotypes and controls. Phenotype A was more obese and more women had metabolic syndrome compared to phenotypes C and D but phenotype C had a similar prevalence of altered glucose metabolism and lipid abnormalities compared to phenotype A which had a higher BMI. These metabolic abnormalities in A and C were higher compared to phenotype D and controls. Multivariate analysis showed that BMI predicts only abnormalities in fasting glucose and triglycerides, while there was no association with androgens. Conclusion(s): In Mediterranean women with PCOS from Sicily with a lower prevalence of obesity, the prevalence of diabetes, altered glucose metabolism and metabolic syndrome were much lower than reported in US studies. Phenotype B was the most metabolically affected phenotype, followed by phenotype A. Phenotype C had an intermediate disorder but with a high prevalence of altered glucose metabolism and lipid alterations. Only the normoandrogenic phenotype D had no metabolic abnormalities.Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Serum Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level could be useful for the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We evaluated the hormonal status in women for the diagnosis of PCOS. A total of 77 PCOS women and 106 healthy women were enrolled in this study. Serum AMH, gonadotropins [luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)], oestradiol, testosterone (total and free), 4-androstenedione (ANDST), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone and insulin levels were measured in all enrolled women. Our data showed that insulin, LH, testosterone, ANDST and AHM levels were significantly higher in the PCOS group and FSH and SHBG levels were lower in the PCOS group. In Receiver operating characteristic analysis, the combination of AMH with SHBG showed higher area under curves (AUC) for PCOS diagnosis with an AUC of 0.843 and a specificity of 81.1% and a sensitivity of 72.7%. Our results suggest that a combination of serum AMH and SHBG levels could be used as a diagnostic biomarker of PCOS.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Women with PCOS have an increased risk of hypertension, altered glucose metabolism and probably an increased lifetime risk of cardiovascular diseases. There is no consensus on the diagnostic criteria for PCOS. This leads to many patients with PCOS are being undiagnosed. It is known that AMH plays a role in the follicular status of PCOS and serum AMH level is increased significantly in women with PCOS compared with normo-ovulatory women. This is why several studies have suggested the inclusion of AMH as a diagnostic criterion in PCOS. What do the results of this study add? Extensive epidemiological data is available which demonstrates an association between higher AMH levels and PCOS, but there was no information available about the combination of AMH level with other hormones and PCOS. This is the first study that has investigated the association of AMH and SHBG, together, with PCOS. Our results suggest that serum AMH and SHBG level in combination could represent a useful and practical test to screen the general population for PCOS. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Many PCOS women in the general population are undiagnosed due to lack of consensus in diagnostic criteria. Therefore, the importance of identifying women with PCOS due to the need for follow-up in short and long-term health risk.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Patient(s): Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; n = 87) and controls (n = 67). Intervention(s): None. Main Outcomes Measure(s): Follicle number per ovary (FNPO), follicle number per cross-section (FNPS), and ovarian volume (OV) were assessed in both ovaries using transvaginal ultrasonography. PCOM was identified based on recent international consensus guidelines or proposed diagnostic thresholds. Result(s): Overall, mean right-left differences were two follicles for FNPO, one follicle for FNPS, and 2 mL for OV. FNPO showed the strongest correlation between ovaries. Its assessment in a single ovary did not impact the diagnosis of PCOM in women with PCOS. However, there were differences in the probability of unilateral versus bilateral PCOM based on FNPS and OV in both groups. Conclusion(s): FNPO is the most reliable unilateral marker of PCOM in light of right-left differences in ovarian morphology. Use of FNPS or OV to define PCOM is discouraged when only one ovary is visualized.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - Objective: This study compared the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and characterized type 2 diabetes (DM2) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profiles between Canadian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and healthy women recruited from the general population. Furthermore, within the PCOS cohort, the study contrasted the CVD and DM2 risk profiles of women with or without MetS. Method(s): Measures of MetS (International Diabetes Federation; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and the American Heart Association definition), DM2 (Diabetes Canada Clinical Guidelines), and CVD risk factors (Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Society statement) were evaluated for 237 women with PCOS (Androgen Excess and PCOS Society definitions) and 42 controls (aged 18-36) in a prospective observational study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-2). Result(s): The prevalence of MetS was 29.5% in the PCOS group, which was approximately six-fold higher than age-matched controls (P < 0.001). Women with PCOS exhibited higher glucose abnormality, acanthosis nigricans, total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TC/HDL-C), and lower sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations when compared with controls after accounting for differences in the BMI (P < 0.01). Further, women with PCOS and MetS exhibited exacerbated insulin and glucose responses to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and greater acanthosis nigricans, hirsutism, TC/HDL-C, TC, and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations compared with their BMI-adjusted counterparts without MetS (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Canadian reproductive-age women with PCOS have a high prevalence of MetS and exhibit adverse cardiometabolic risk factors that warrant early screening and regular monitoring across their reproductive lifespan.Copyright © 2019 The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada/La Societe des obstetriciens et gynecologues du Canada.

N2  - To (i) determine whether women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) from a population-based cohort experience elevated depression symptoms and (ii) characterize the trajectory of symptoms over the lifespan. Design(s): The association between PCOS and longitudinal depression scores was investigated among 1127 black and white women participating in Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. PCOS was ascertained at baseline (ages 20 to 32) by U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, incorporating androgens and symptoms of oligomenorrhea and hirsutism. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale was repeated prospectively in 5-year intervals over 25 years. Mixed-effects models evaluated the association between depression scores and PCOS after adjustment for confounders and characterized the trajectory of scores. The impact of race was explored.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.

N2  - Research question: Is anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) a valid tool to diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) according to different subsets of criteria among an unselected group of women? Design: In this cross-sectional study, AMH concentrations were measured in an unselected group of women. The ability of AMH to diagnose PCOS according to National Institutes of Health (NIH), Rotterdam-2003 and Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AE-PCOS) criteria was tested by using frozen serum aliquots (n = 392) that had been collected from a previous prevalence study of PCOS. Result(s): The respective age and body mass index adjusted area under the curve (aAUC, 95% confidence interval) values were 0.80 (0.71-0.89), 0.74 (0.67-0.81) and 0.71 (0.64-0.79). When the definition of polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) was set to an antral follicle count (AFC) of 20 instead of 12, the prevalence of syndrome dropped from 19.9% to 10.2% and from 15.3% to 8.9% according to Rotterdam-2003 and AE-PCOS criteria, respectively. In patients with Phenotype A, who had hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and PCOM, AMH had an aAUC of 0.85 (0.77-0.92) to diagnose the syndrome. In Phenotypes B (hyperandrogenism + ovulatory dysfunction), C (hyperandrogenism + PCOM) or D (ovulatory dysfunction + PCOM), AMH had poor to fair ability to diagnose the syndrome. Conclusion(s): AMH has poor to fair validity to diagnose PCOS among an unselected group of women, except for patients bearing all features of the syndrome (Phenotype A). This finding is valid using the NIH, Rotterdam-2003 and AE-PCOS criteria and even after revising the definition of PCOM as AFC >=20.Copyright © 2019 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the sleep of subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), with and without hyperandrogenism, in comparison with a healthy control group and examine the effects of hyperandrogenism and obesity on sleep parameters. METHOD(S): A total of 44 volunteers were recruited to participate in the study. Clinical, biochemical and polysomnographic parameters were used to diagnose PCOS and hyperandrogenism. The evaluation of sleep quality was made using validated questionnaires and polysomnography test. The frequency of obstructive sleep apnea was also compared between the groups. RESULT(S): The study revealed that women with PCOS presented poorer subjective sleep quality, increased incidence of snoring and a higher risk of obstructive sleep apnea, based on the Berlin questionnaire. Also, after adjusting for body mass index, PCOS subjects had rapid eye movement (REM) time lower than those in the control group. PCOS women versus those without hyperandrogenism did not differ on any sleep measurement. Women with obstructive sleep apnea were only diagnosed in the PCOS group. CONCLUSION(S): Our results indicate that PCOS impairs subjective sleep quality, as well as objective sleep quality, due to a reduction in REM sleep stage time in women diagnosed with the syndrome. Obesity affected sleep-related parameters but hyperandrogenism had no effect. Only the PCOS group had obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis.

N2  - Objective: To study different antimullerian hormone (AMH) isoforms in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and healthy regularly cycling women and to investigate whether levels of AMH isoforms combined with baseline characteristics can predict PCOS. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Setting(s): Fertility clinic. Patient(s): Eighty-eight women with PCOS and 24 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched normal control subject women recruited from April 2010 to February 2013. AMH isoforms were analyzed in biobanked serum samples collected at Holbaek Fertility Clinic, Denmark. All study participants went through a baseline examination including gynecologic history, objective examination, transvaginal ultrasound, and blood sampling. Each woman was characterized by measurement of total T, free T, SHBG, A, DHEAS, FSH, LH, E2, PRL, TSH, serum insulin, plasma glucose, and C-peptide. Interventions(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Serum levels of three different AMH isoforms. Result(s): Levels of AMH measured with each of three AMH ELISAs were significantly higher in women with PCOS compared with control women. The ratio between AMH isoforms showed significant associations with metabolic parameters (BMI, SHBG, C-peptide, cholesterols, triglycerides, and the modified homeostasis-model assessment). Prediction of PCOS showed a high precision with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 97% when AMH measurements were combined with androgens and BMI. Conclusion(s): Three ELISAs detecting different parts of the AMH molecule all detected significantly higher levels in women with PCOS compared with control women. The relative distribution of AMH isoforms did not differ between women with PCOS and control women. AMH isoforms alone and in combination with baseline characteristics predicted PCOS with close to 100% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) to the diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-seven patients with PCOS diagnosis criteria were included in the study. Sixteen volunteer patients without hormonal disturbances and with normal menstrual cycles were evaluated as the control group. Gray scale ultrasonography (US) and SWE measurements in both ovaries were performed by a single radiologist who was blinded to the clinical and laboratory results. Result(s): The SWE measurements in PCOS group were 8.4+/-2.0 kPa for the right ovary and 9.4+/-3.9 kPa for the left ovary and in the control group 7.8+/-4.1 for the right ovary and 8.6+/-2.5 kPa for the left ovary. There was no statistically significant difference between the PCOS and the control group according to the SWE results (for right ovary p=0.356, for left ovary p=0.258, and total ovary p=0.293). Conclusion(s): The ovarian morphology is still the most reliable imaging finding in the diagnosis of PCOS, although it is controversial especially among adolescents. Although the diagnostic efficacy of SWE is demonstrated in a variety of soft tissue lesions, we did not find any significant contribution of SWE to the diagnosis PCOS. Therefore, the promising value of elastography is yet to be defined for the diagnosis of PCOS.Copyright © 2019 Societatea Romana de Ultrasonografie in Medicina si Biologie. All rights reserved.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with many traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, but it is unclear whether PCOS is an independent risk factor for hypertension. Objective(s): To investigate in a population-based setup whether PCOS associates with the risk of hypertension independently of body mass index (BMI) and with cardiovascular manifestations. Design(s): Cross-sectional assessments in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 at ages 31 and 46 years. Setting(s): General community. Participant(s): Women who reported both oligo/amenorrhea and hirsutism at age 31 years and/or a diagnosis of PCOS by age 46 years [self-reported PCOS (srPCOS), n = 279] and women without PCOS symptoms or diagnosis (n = 1577). Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Blood pressure (BP), BMI, and cardiovascular manifestations. Result(s): Use of antihypertensive medication was significantly more common in women with srPCOS. At age 31 years, women with srPCOS had significantly higher systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) than control women (SBP: Normal weight: 119.9 6 13.2 vs 116.9 6 11.4 mm Hg, P = 0.017; overweight/obese: 126.1 6 14.3 vs 123.0 6 11.9 mm Hg, P = 0.031; and DBP: Normal weight: 75.5 6 10.0 vs 72.4 69.6mmHg, P = 0.003; overweight/obese: 80.7611.8 vs 78.0610.6mmHg, P = 0.031). At age 46 years, srPCOS was significantly associated with hypertension (adjusted odds ratio = 1.56; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.13) independently of BMI and with higher cardiovascular morbidity (6.8% vs 3.4%, P = 0.011). Hypertensive srPCOS displayed consistent, unfavorable changes in cardiac structure and function compared with controls. Conclusion(s): Women with srPCOS displayed higher BP compared with controls already at early age and srPCOS was associated with hypertension independently of overweight/obesity. srPCOS was associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity in premenopausal women, suggesting that cardiovascular disease risk factors should be screened and efficiently managed early enough in women with PCOS.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.

N2  - Objective: To study the reproductive and metabolic differences between daughters of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOSd) and control women (Cd) after menarche. Design(s): Case-control study. Setting(s): Clinical endocrinology unit. Patient(s): We studied 43 PCOSd and 28 Cd 1.5-6 years after menarche. Intervention(s): Determination of anthropometry, pubertal development, hirsutism, oral glucose tolerance test, and GnRH analogue test. Main Outcome Measure(s): Ferriman score, sex steroids, gonadotropins, antimullerian hormone (AMH), ovarian volumes, and glucose and insulin levels. Result(s): The groups were similar in chronologic, gynecologic, and menarchal ages and anthropometric variables. Ferriman score, ovarian volumes, and AMH were higher in PCOSd. Propensity score analysis showed that there were significant differences in LH, LH-FSH ratio, T and free androgen index, post-stimulated LH and LH-FSH ratio, and 2-hour insulin that could be attributed only to the fact of being a PCOS daughter. The generalized linear model showed that higher LH levels were positively associated with AMH and T levels. Conclusion(s): We found that higher LH, androgen, and insulin levels are present in PCOSd during the postmenarchal period, which may establish the basis for the development of PCOS during adulthood. Moreover, LH levels were associated with AMH levels, which supports that the neuroendocrine feedback proposed for AMH and LH is present in humans and that this feature is probably programed in utero, as recently shown in mice.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - Objective: This study explores the role of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and LH/FSH ratio in diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): In this multicentre cross-sectional descriptive study, a total of 863 infertile women between 18 and 45 years were evaluated at three infertility centres in Vietnam and were recruited from June 2016 to June 2017. The patients were classified into two groups: Group I included 441 patients with PCOS (based on Rotterdam criteria consensus) and Group II included 422 non-PCOS women. Diagnosis of PCOS was established based on Rotterdam 2003 consensus, and exclusion criteria were ovarian disease (ovary cyst/tumour), history of ovarian surgery and ovarian failure. Result(s): At an optimum cut-off level of 32.79 pmol/L, AMH showed sensitivity and specificity of 78.50% and 75.83%, respectively, with the AUC 0.852 (95% CI: 0.826-0.875). The LH/FSH ratio had a similar AUC at the optimum cut-off of 1.33 (AUC = 0.867, 95% CI 0.842-0.889), which demonstrated a similar diagnosis value to AMH (P = 0.340). By using multiple logistic regression analysis, 1 ng/mL increase in AMH levels was associated with an increased risk of PCOS (OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.506-1.764; P < 0.001). Similarly, one unit increase in LH/FSH ratio was associated with 14.433 times increased (95% CI: 9.302-22.395; P < 0.001) risk of PCOS. There were no significant differences between values of AMH and LH/FSH ratio in PCOS diagnosis, as the difference between the two AUCs was 0.013, 95% CI: -0.024 to 0.028 and P = 0.897. Conclusion(s): The value of serum AMH concentration has been found not significantly superior to LH/FSH ratio in PCOS diagnosis. Although these biomarkers separately are not adequate for PCOS diagnosis based on their own value, the combination of different endocrine factors including AMH, LH and LH/FSH ratio together with BMI and other anthropometric and clinical characteristics may offer extra value to establish the diagnosis of PCOS.Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Objective: To study the associations between prenatal exposures and risk of developing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): National registry-based cohort study. Setting(s): Sweden. Population: Girls born in Sweden during the years 1982-1995 (n = 681 123). Method(s): The girls were followed until the year 2010 for a diagnosis of PCOS. We estimated the associations between maternal body mass index (BMI), smoking, and size at birth with the risk of developing a PCOS diagnosis. Risks were calculated by adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Main Outcome Measure(s): A diagnosis of PCOS at 15 years of age or later. Result(s): During the follow-up period 3738 girls were diagnosed with PCOS (0.54%). Girls with mothers who were overweight or obese had 1.5-2.0 times higher risk of PCOS (aHR 1.52, 95% CI 1.36-1.70; aHR 1.97, 95% CI 1.61-2.41, respectively), compared with girls born to mothers of normal weight. The risk of PCOS was increased if the mother smoked during pregnancy (1-9 cigarettes/day, aHR 1.31, 95% CI 1.18-1.47; >=10 cigarettes/day, aHR 1.44, 95% CI 1.27-1.64). Being born small for gestational age (SGA) was associated with a later diagnosis of PCOS in crude estimates, but the association was not significant after adjusting for maternal factors. Conclusion(s): Maternal smoking and increased BMI appear to increase the risk of PCOS in offspring. The association between SGA and the development of PCOS appears to be mediated by maternal factors. Tweetable abstract: Smoking during pregnancy and high maternal BMI are associated with PCOS diagnosis in the offspring.Copyright © 2018 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists

N2  - Objective: Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is derived from the small antral follicles, and an elevated level has been suggested to add value to the Rotterdam criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. Therefore, the role of AMH in the classical phenotype of PCOS was defined within a Caucasian population. Design(s): This was a cross-sectional study. Patient(s): Sixty Five women without PCOS and 110 women with PCOS fulfilling all 3 diagnostic Rotterdam criteria. Measurements: The main outcomes were the utility of serum AMH for the diagnosis of PCOS and its relationship to the metabolic parameters. Result(s): Anti-Mullerian hormone was increased in PCOS compared to controls (P <.001). Areas under the receiver operator curve showed AMH to be predictive of PCOS (0.76) using a cut-off AMH of 46 pmol/L, which is derived from the 95th percentile of the controls that gave a 41% sensitivity and 86% specificity; an AMH cut-off of 35 pmol/L gave a 55% sensitivity and 79% specificity. Age- and BMI-adjusted multiple logistic regression showed that AMH was more predictive of PCOS independently of either serum testosterone (T) (OR = 4.04; 95% CI 1.42-11.11; P =.007) or free androgen index (FAI) (OR = 3.90; 95% CI 1.40-10.83; P =.009). Conclusion(s): Whilst an elevated AMH has poor sensitivity, it is fourfold more likely to be associated with a diagnosis of PCOS, and supplementary to biochemical parameters will make a positive diagnosis of PCOS in 22% of patients when neither serum testosterone nor FAI is elevated.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is thought to be the most well-known endocrine issue in ladies of regenerative age manifested with various metabolic disturbances and a wide spectrum of clinical features such as menstrual abnormalities, obesity, and hyperandrogenism. This study was aimed to measure the association between HbA1c and body mass index (BMI) in PCOS women. This study was performed in AL-Batool hospital for obstetric and gynecological diseases in Ba'quba city/ Iraq May 2017 to January 2018. It includes 42 patients with PCOS aging from 20-37 years and 42 healthy control. Fasting venous blood samples were obtained for analysis of fasting blood glucose (FBG), hemoglobin (Hb) and HbA1c. BMI was calculated for all study participants by the present weight in Kg dividing by the square of height in meters. This study involved 42 cases of PCOS (case group) and other 42 participants were free of disease (control group). The mean age among patients of case group was significantly higher than that in control group (26.95 +/- 4.77 versus 23.9 +/- 2.71, P=0.015). 90.5% of patients in control group had normal BMI level while 42.9% of patients in the case group were class I obese. Mean of BMI among patients of case group was significantly higher than that of the control group (29.84 +/- 4.22 versus 22.8 +/- 2.02, P=0.001). According to HbA1c level, all patients in control group and 90.5% of patients in the case group were non-diabetic. The mean of HbA1c among patients of case group was significantly higher than that in control group (4.76 +/- 0.88 versus 3.9 +/- 0.6, P=0.001). In the present study, it was found that there is a significant positive correlation between HbA1c and BMI (r= 0.567, P= 0.001). BMI is positively correlated with HbA1c and associated with glycemic control in PCOS.Copyright © 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives: Although the Rotterdam 2003 polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) diagnostic criteria is widely used, the need to consider multiple variables makes it unwieldy in clinical practice. We propose a simplified PCOS criteria wherein diagnosis is made if two of the following three items were present: (i) oligomenorrhoea, (ii) anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) above threshold and/or (iii) hyperandrogenism defined as either testosterone above threshold and/or the presence of hirsutism. Design setting and participants: This prospective cross-sectional study consists of healthy women (n = 157) recruited at an annual hospital health screen for staff and volunteers from the university community, and a patient cohort (n = 174) comprising women referred for suspected PCOS. Main Outcome Measure(s): We used the healthy cohort to establish threshold values for serum testosterone, antral follicle counts (AFC), ovarian volume (OV) and AMH. Women from the patient cohort, classified as PCOS by simplified PCOS criteria, AMH alone and Rotterdam 2003, were compared with respect to prevalence of oligomenorrhoea, hyperandrogenism and metabolic indices. Result(s): In healthy women, testosterone >=1.89 nmol/L, AFC >=22 follicles and OV >=8.44 mL, best predicted oligomenorrhoea and were used as threshold values for PCOS criteria. An AMH level >=37.0 pmol/L best predicted polycystic ovarian morphology. AMH alone as a single biomarker demonstrated poor specificity (58.9%) for PCOS compared to Rotterdam 2003. In contrast, there was a 94% overlap in women selected as PCOS by the simplified PCOS criteria and Rotterdam 2003. The population characteristics of these two groups of PCOS women showed no significant mean differences in androgenic, ovarian, AMH and metabolic (BMI, HOMA-IR) variables. Conclusion(s): Our data recommend the simplified PCOS criteria with population-specific thresholds for diagnosis of PCOS. Its ability to replace ovarian ultrasound biometry with the highly correlated variable AMH, and use of testosterone as a single marker for hyperandrogenaemia alongside the key symptoms of oligomenorrhoea and hirsutism confers significant clinical potential for the diagnosis of PCOS.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but its association with prediabetes and T2DM is unknown in Qatar. A cross sectional analysis of 3,017 Qatari subjects from the Qatar Biobank, identified 749 women aged 18-40 years, 720 of whom were assessed by the National Institute for Health (NIH) Guidelines for PCOS. Prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7-6.4% and/or impaired fasting glucose (IFG): fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 100-125mg/dL (5.6-6.9mmol/L)), and T2DM (fasting plasma glucose>125mg/dL (>=7mmol/L), and/or HbA1c>=6.5%) were determined. The prevalence of prediabetes was 10.6% and the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was found to be 4.0% in the total population. Overall, 12.1% of 720 women had PCOS, of whom FPG and HbA1c were available in 62 women with PCOS: 19.4% had prediabetes and 9.7% had diabetes. An adverse cardiovascular risk profile for IFG women compared to normal women was found. Women with PCOS alone had a similar adverse cardiovascular profile as those with IFG alone and T2DM. Thus, the risk of prediabetes and diabetes is increased in Qatari women with PCOS, with an adverse cardiovascular risk profile similar to that seen in prediabetes and T2DM.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Obesity leads to deleterious effects on not only cardiovascular health but also on the reproductive health of women. We estimate the prevalence of menstrual irregularity and of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in Samoan women, among whom obesity prevalence is extremely high. We explore the association of these reproductive health conditions with adiposity, cardiometabolic risk factors, and androgen levels. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional sample of Samoan women 25-39 years of age (n=470) from a larger population-based genome-wide association study of adiposity and cardiometabolic disease was assessed for the prevalence of oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea (OM/AM) using a self-reported questionnaire. Serum androgens and anti-Mullerian hormone levels were assayed to determine hyperandrogenemia and presence of polycystic ovaries (PCO), respectively, using criterion values. PCOS was classified using NIH guidelines of having at least two of the three conditions: menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, and PCO. We contrasted socio-demographic, reproductive health, and cardiometabolic risk factors between those with and without OM/AM and similarly for PCOS. RESULT(S): The prevalence of OM/AM was 7.4% (95% CI: 5.1, 9.8), and women with OM/AM had significantly higher central adiposity. PCOS was estimated at 6.8% (95% CI: 4.5, 9.1), and those with PCOS were younger but had higher overall and central adiposity measures, higher triglycerides, and higher prevalence of insulin resistance than women without PCOS. CONCLUSION(S): The prevalence of menstrual irregularity and PCOS are less than hypothesized given the high levels of adiposity in this population. Nevertheless, Samoan women with menstrual irregularity and other features of PCOS have significantly poorer metabolic health.Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: To diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in young infertile women using different diagnostic criteria. To define serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) cutoff values for PCOS definition. To investigate the correlation between AMH and body mass index (BMI). Method(s): Retrospective case-control study. A total of 140 infertile women (age 21-35 years) were enrolled. PCOS was defined according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, the Rotterdam consensus criteria and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AE-PCOS) criteria. ROC curve analysis was performed to define AMH thresholds for PCOS definition according to the three different diagnostic criteria. Correlation between AMH and BMI was investigated. Result(s): The prevalence of PCOS under the NIH criteria, the Rotterdam criteria and the AE-PCOS criteria was 27.1, 40 and 29.3%, respectively. The optimal thresholds of AMH to distinguish NIH PCOS from infertile controls was 5.20 ng/ml (AUC = 0.86, sensitivity 79%, specificity 80%); the best cutoff to detect Rotterdam PCOS was 4.57 ng/ml (AUC = 0.85, sensitivity 78%, specificity 81%); a cutoff of 4.85 ng/ml (AUC = 0.85, sensitivity 80%, specificity 78%) defined PCOS women according to AE-PCOS criteria. The prevalence of the syndrome became 37.1, 44.3 and 39.2% according to the three criteria, respectively, using AMH threshold between 4.57 and 5.20 ng/ml as an alternative to antral follicle count and/or hyperandrogenism. Conclusion(s): Anti-Mullerian hormone may reconcile the three diagnostic criteria and allow the PCOS diagnosis in women with mild symptoms. No significant correlation was found between AMH and BMI in PCOS women and controls.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have compromised cardiovascular health profiles and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. In order to evaluate potential consequences, we aim to compare the cardiovascular and metabolic health of the children from women with PCOS with a population-based reference cohort. We included children from women with PCOS between the age of 2.5 to 4 years (n = 42) and 6 to 8 years (n = 32). The reference groups consisted of 168 (3-4 years old) and 130 children (7-8 years old). In an extensive cardiovascular screening program, we measured anthropometrics and blood pressure (all children), heart function and vascular rigidity (young children), metabolic laboratory assessment and carotid intima thickness (old age-group). Results showed that young PCOS offspring have a significantly lower diastolic blood pressure (beta = 2.3 [95% confidence interval, CI: 0.5-4.0]) and higher aortic pulse pressure (beta = -1.4 [95% CI: -2.5 to -0.2]), compared to the reference population. Furthermore, a higher left ventricle internal diameter but a lower tissue Doppler imaging of the right wall in systole compared to the reference group was found. Older offspring of women with PCOS presented with a significantly lower breast and abdominal circumference, but higher triglycerides (beta = -0.1 [95% CI: -0.2 to -0.1]), LDL-cholesterol (beta = -0.4 [95% CI: -0.6 to -0.1]), and higher carotid intima-media thickness (beta = -31.7 [95% CI: -46.6 to -16.9]) compared to the reference group. In conclusion, we observe subtle but distinct cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities already at an early age in PCOS offspring compared to a population-based reference group, despite a lower diastolic blood pressure, breast, and abdominal circumference. These preliminary findings require confirmation in independent data sets.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Objective We intended to establish the threshold for anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in China. Methods A total of 771 women (653 with PCOS and 118 healthy controls) were enrolled. The serum AMH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), FSH/LH, prolactin, estradiol, testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), 17alpha-OH progesterone (17alpha-OHP), fasting insulin (INS), fasting glucose, free androgen index (FAI%) and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index were analyzed, and the diagnostic utility of AMH, LH/FSH, T and INS was established using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. With AMH, LH/ FSH, T and INS as independent variables, a logistic regression model was established, and the ROC curve for combined detection was fitted with the probability value of the model. Results The serum level of FSH, LH, LH/FSH, AMH, FAI%, 17alpha-OHP, fasting INS, T, SHBG, DHEA-S and HOMA-IR were altered in the PCOS patients. The best compromise between sensitivity and specificity was found at an AMH cut-off level of 8.16 ng/ml and 5.89 ng/ml for the age groups 20-29 and 30-39 years, with the corresponding area under the curve being 0.846 and 0.865 respectively. The area under the ROC curve for combined detection was 0.951, which was significantly greater than that of each index. Finally, the concentration of AMH was associated with FSH, LH, LH/FSH, T, and ovarian volume in PCOS patients. Conclusion The optimal AMH diagnostic threshold for PCOS was 8.16 ng/ml (20-29 years) and 5.89 ng/ ml (30-39 years) in the Chinese population of this study. Moreover, serum AMH, LH/FSH, T and INS could be used in combination to improve the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity for the detection of PCOS.Copyright © 2018 Yue et al.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder among the women of reproductive age. We conducted a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study to analyze the association between PCOS and the subsequent development of gynecological cancers, namely endometrial, breast, and ovarian cancer. For this population-based cohort study, we used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, which contains information on approximately 24.7 million insured individuals. The cohort included women who had received a diagnosis of PCOS between 1998 and 2013. An age-matched systematic random-sampling method with a ratio of 1:4 was used for patient selection for the non-PCOS reference cohort. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to determine the effects of PCOS on the risks of gynecologic and breast cancer. The data are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The PCOS cohort consisted of 8155 patients with PCOS, and the comparison cohort consisted of 32,620 matched patients without PCOS. The incidence of endometrial cancer was 226 and 15 per 100,000 person-years in the PCOS and comparison groups, respectively. A statistically significant higher risk of endometrial cancer was found in the PCOS cohort (adjusted HR [aHR] = 17.7, 95% CI = 4.9-64.2) than in the comparison cohort. However, no association was observed between PCOS and ovarian (aHR = 1.64, 95% CI: 0.63-4.27) or breast cancer (aHR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.58-1.65). The results of this large population-based cohort study supported the premise that women with PCOS might have an increased risk of endometrial cancer, but no association between PCOS and the risks of ovarian and breast cancer was found.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

N2  - Objectives: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders, affecting up to 10% of reproductive-age women. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta family and has an inhibitory effect on primordial follicle recruitment in the ovary. The study aimed to investigate the importance of serum AMH levels in the different phenotypes of PCOS and find the optimal cut-off level of AMH in PCOS patients. Method(s): This was a prospective clinical trial in which diagnoses of 50 PCOS patients based on Rotterdam revised criteria were compared to 50 normo-ovulatory cases. Additionally, the PCOS group was divided into 2 subgroups based on 2 or 3 Rotterdam criteria and compared to 50 normo-ovulatory cases. Result(s): When compared with the control group, the AMH levels of the PCOS group were significantly higher than those of the control group (6.81 +/- 2.8 ng/ml vs. 3.22 +/- 2.2 ng/ml, p < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis, the AMH levels of Group 1 and Group 2 were significantly higher than those of the control group (p < 0.001). The AMH cut-off value of 4.1 ng/ml was found to distinguish healthy women from PCOS patients, with 84% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Conclusion(s): Subgroup analyses showed higher levels of AMH in the severe PCOS group, but the difference was not statistically significant. More studies are suggested for researching the different PCOS subgroups to detect optimal AMH thresholds.Copyright © 2017 by The Association of Health Research & Strategy.

N2  - Objectives: To compare Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) concentrations between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients and healthy women who have polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) with regular menstrual cycles, and to determine a diagnostic cutoff value for PCOS women during reproductive period. Method(s): This study was carried out between February 2013 and October 2017 at the Department of Obstetricsand Gynecology, Izmir Katip Celebi University Ataturk Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey. Seventy PCOS patients and 70 PCOM women with normal menstrual cycles were included in the study. Blood samples of the subjects were obtained following an 8-hour fast for AMH and biochemical assessments, serum gonadotropin, and androgen measurements. Result(s): The mean serum AMH levels of PCOS patients were found to be higher than PCOM women with normal menstrual cycles (p<0.01). The optimal serum AMH cutoff value for PCOS diagnosis was determined as 3.51 ng/ml (sensitivity 72.8%, specificity 75.7%). Conclusion(s): Serum AMH concentrations are significantly higher in PCOS patients independent from the ovarian morphology and number of follicles per ovary. Positive and negative predictive values of AMH in PCOS diagnosis were found to be 75% and 73.6%, respectively, with a cutoff value of 3.51 ng/mL.Copyright © 2018, Saudi Arabian Armed Forces Hospital.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Our prior meta-analyses demonstrated an increased prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but with substantial clinical heterogeneity. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: We aimed to update our previous review to quantify the prevalence of IGT and T2DM in PCOS with only quality studies (good and fair quality). We also aimed to examine the contribution of parameters including ethnicity, obesity and method of diagnosing T2DM in explaining the observed heterogeneity in IGT and T2DM prevalence in PCOS. SEARCH METHOD(S): We conducted a literature search (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, clinical trial registries and hand-searching) up to June 2016 to identify studies reporting the prevalence of dysglycemia (IGT and T2DM) in women with and without PCOS. We included studies where women with PCOS (defined according to original National Institute of Health) were compared to women without PCOS for the end-points of the prevalence of IGT or T2DM. We excluded case reports, case series, editorials, and narrative reviews. Studies where PCOS was diagnosed by self-report, or where IGT or T2DM were measured by fasting glucose, only were excluded. We assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using a priori criteria based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scaling (NOS) for nonrandomized studies. Data are presented as odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) with random-effects meta-analysis by Mantel-Haenszel methods. We assessed the contribution of demographic and clinical factors to heterogeneity using subgroup and meta-regression analysis. OUTCOME(S): We reviewed 4530 studies and included 40 eligible studies in the final analysis. On meta-analysis of quality studies, women with PCOS had an increased prevalence of IGT (OR = 3.26, 95% CI: 2.17-4.90) and T2DM (OR = 2.87, 95% CI: 1.44-5.72), which differed by ethnicity (for IGT, Asia: 5-fold, the Americas: 4-fold and Europe: 3-fold), was higher with obesity, and doubled among studies using self-report or administrative data for diagnosing diabetes. The ethnicity-related difference retained its significance for Asia and Europe in BMI-matched subgroups. Clear contributors to heterogeneity did not emerge in meta-regression. WIDER IMPLICATION(S): Our findings underscore the importance of PCOS as a cause of dysglycemia with a higher prevalence of IGT and T2DM. They support the relevance of ethnicity and obesity and emphasize the need for accurate diagnostic methods for diabetes. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42017056524.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Context Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is closely linked to hyperandrogenism (HA). In PCOS, HA has been associated with metabolic disturbances that increase the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Objective To assess the association of high serum androgen levels, as a postmenopausal remnant of PCOS, with the prevalence of atherosclerosis and incidence of CVD in postmenopausal women. Design The Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study. Median follow-up was 11.36 years. Setting General community. Participants A total of 2578 women aged >55 years. Exclusion criteria were missing informed consent or follow-up data, perimenopausal status, and menopause by surgical intervention or at an unnatural age (age <40 or >62). Intervention None. Main Outcomes and Measures Linear, logistic, and Cox regression models assessed the association of top quartiles (P 75) of serum testosterone, free androgen index (FAI), dehydroepiandrosterone, and androstenedione and sex hormone-binding globulin with coronary artery calcium, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), pulse wave velocity, peripheral artery disease, and incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and CVD. Results Mean age (standard deviation) was 70.19 (8.71) years, and average time since menopause was 19.85 (9.94) years. Highest quartile FAI was associated with higher pulse wave velocity (beta [95% confidence interval (CI)], 0.009 [0.000 to 0.018]). Highest quartile dehydroepiandrosterone [beta (95% CI), -0.008 (-0.015 to -0.001)] and androstenedione [beta (95% CI), -0.010 (-0.017 to -0.003)] levels were associated with a lower IMT. We found no association between high androgen levels and incident stroke, CHD, or CVD. Conclusion Postmenopausal high androgen levels were not associated with an elevated risk for CVD. Cardiovascular health in women with PCOS might be better than was anticipated.Copyright © 2018 Endocrine Society.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with obesity and low grade inflammation and the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) could be increased in PCOS. Method(s): National register-based study including women with PCOS and no previous diagnosis of CVD, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. PCOS Denmark (N = 18,112) included women with PCOS in the Danish National Patient Register. PCOS Odense University Hospital (OUH, N = 1165) was an embedded cohort including premenopausal women with PCOS and clinical and biochemical examination. Three age-matched controls were included per patient in PCOS Denmark (N = 52,769). The main study outcome was CVD events including hypertension and dyslipidemia defined according to nationwide in- and outpatient hospital contact diagnosis codes and/or inferred from filled medicine prescriptions. Result(s): The age at inclusion was median (quartiles) 29 (23-35) years and follow up was 11.1 (6.9-16.0) years. The Hazard ratio (95% CI) for development of CVD in PCOS Denmark was 1.7 (1.7; 1.8) (P < 0.001) and the total event rate of CVD was 22.6 per 1000 patient years in PCOS Denmark vs. 13.2 per 1000 patient years in controls (P < 0.001). The median age at diagnosis of CVD was 35 (28-42) years in PCOS Denmark vs. 36 (30-43) years in controls (P < 0.001). Obesity, diabetes, and infertility, and previous use of oral contraceptives were associated with increased risk of development of CVD in PCOS Denmark (P < 0.001). Women in PCOS OUH resembled women in PCOS Denmark regarding risk of CVD. Age, BMI, blood pressure, lipid status, and glycemic status predicted development of CVD in PCOS OUH. Conclusion(s): The event rate of CVD including hypertension and dyslipidemia was higher in PCOS compared to controls. The risk of developing CVD must be considered even in young women with PCOS.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Objective: Recently, there was a new recommendation of ultrasonographic criteria to diagnosis polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In addition, serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) was proposed as a surrogate marker for diagnosis of PCOS, but AMH cut-off level for diagnosis of PCOS is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of serum AMH and evaluate new ultrasonographic criteria, follicle number per ovary (FNPO) threshold >= 25 follicles and ovarian volume (OV) > 10 mL, for diagnosis of PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted. Fifty-five PCOS women and sixty-three normal ovulatory, non-hyperandrogenic women were recruited. Transvaginal or transrectal ultrasonography was performed in all participants to evaluate follicle number and OV. Serum AMH was evaluated in both study groups. Result(s): The mean age of the participants was 25.1 +/- 5.3 years old in PCOS group and 29.7 +/- 7.2 years old in control group. Mean AMH, FNPO and OV in PCOS women were significantly higher than those in non-PCOS women. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve of AMH was 0.903. The threshold of AMH at 4.7 ng/mL offered the best compromise between 80% sensitivity and 77.8% specificity. The appropriated threshold values for FNPO, follicle number per cross-section (FNPS) and OV were 15 follicles, 7 follicles and 6.5 mL, respectively. Serum AMH level was significantly positively correlated with FNPO, FNPS and OV in both PCOS and control groups. In PCOS women, serum AMH showed strongly correlation with FNPO (r = 0.53, p < 0.001) and weakly correlation with total testosterone (r = 0.283, p = 0.036). Conclusion(s): Serum AMH had a good diagnostic performance for diagnosis of PCOS presenting with oligo/anovulation and hyperandrogenism. AMH threshold at 4.7 ng/mL was the best compromise level for diagnosis of PCOS. FNPO >=15, FNPS >=7 and OV >= 6.5 mL were reliable threshold for detecting polycystic ovaries in women with frank manifestation of PCOS.Copyright © 2018

N2  - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common and complex condition characterized by endocrine features and influenced by genetic and environmental factors. In Southeast Asia and Thailand, the prevalence of PCOS is unknown. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of and determine factors associated with PCOS in Thai adolescents. We administered a validated questionnaire to 600 university female participants aged 17-19 years from Mahidol University in Bangkok. Of these, 548 (91.33%) responded and agreed to participate. Two-hundred and seventy-nine girls (50.91%) were identified as likely having PCOS and defined as 'probable cases'. Of those 279 participants, 248 (88.88%) were evaluated further for PCOS using the Rotterdam criteria. A complete history was taken, and a physical examination including trans-abdominal ultrasound was performed. Blood chemistry tests were performed to exclude similar conditions and to investigate potential co-morbidities. The prevalence of PCOS in Thai adolescents was found to be 5.29%. After multivariate analyses, moderate acne was the strongest risk factor for PCOS. The odd ratios (95% confidence interval) for the presence of mild acne, moderate acne, and oligo- or amenorrhea in participants with PCOS were 2.83 (1.01-7.90; p =.47), 31.69 (10.07-99.67; p <.001), and 5.89 (2.42-14.37; p <.001), respectively.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Background: To evaluate role of AMH as a diagnostic tool for PCOS. Method(s): This was a prospective case-control study on women attending Gynae OPD of Dr RML Hospital, New Delhi, from 1 November 2015 to 31 March 2017. Study comprised of 45 women with PCOS, diagnosed using Rotterdam criteria and 45 women as controls. Clinical history included oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, examination included BMI, Ferriman-Gallwey score, investigations included blood for FSH, LH, estradiol, TSH, prolactin, total testosterone, AMH level and pelvic USG which was done for all women. Result(s): Both PCOS cases and control were matched for age and BMI. Median AMH levels of 4.32 ng/ml in PCOS cases was almost twice that of 2.32 ng/ml in controls (p = 0.001). Maximum diagnostic potential of AMH alone for PCOS was at a cut-off of 3.44 ng/ml with sensitivity of 77.78% and specificity of 68.89%. AMH was used as an adjunct to existing Rotterdam criteria as the fourth parameter OA+HA+PCOM+AMH (any three out of four) yielded sensitivity of 80%. However, when PCOM in Rotterdam criteria was replaced by AMH, OA+HA+AMH (any two out of three) or OA/HA+AMH resulted in sensitivity of 86.67 and 71.11%, respectively. Conclusion(s): AMH levels were significantly higher in PCOS than in controls. AMH as an independent marker could not effectively diagnose PCOS. However, AMH levels as an adjunct to existing Rotterdam criteria for diagnosis of PCOS had good diagnostic potential.Copyright © 2017, Federation of Obstetric & Gynecological Societies of India.

N2  - Objective The prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in the Qatari population is unknown and hence the estimated impact on the local population cannot be determined. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence and metabolic features of PCOS among Qatari women. Design Cross sectional analysis. Patients 3,017 Qatari subjects volunteered to be phenotyped and genotyped for the Qatar Biobank from which all women between the ages of 18-40 years were identified (750). Measurements 720 women had testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) measurements. PCOS was diagnosed according the National Institute of Health (NIH) Guidelines of a raised androgen level (free androgen index >4.5 or a raised total testosterone) and menstrual irregularity after the exclusion of other conditions. Results All results are reported as mean value of PCOS versus control. 87 of 720 women fulfilled the NIH guidelines (12.1%) for PCOS specifically using a free androgen index greater than 4.5 or a total testosterone greater than 2.7nmol/l and menstrual irregularity. Subjects were heavier with a more metabolic profile of a greater systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher levels of C reactive protein, insulin (p<0.01) and HbA1c (P<0.02), and decreased HDL levels (p<0.01). Pulse wave velocity as a marker of arterial stiffness was also increased (p<0.05) Conclusions By NIH guidelines the prevalence of PCOS in this Qatari cohort was 12.1% that would likely reflect 20% by Rotterdam criteria, with a markedly more metabolic phenotype than Qatari controls.Copyright © 2017 Dargham et al.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION Can cluster analysis be used to differentiate between normo-ovulatory women with normal ovaries and normo-ovulatory women with polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) in a non-subjective manner? SUMMARY ANSWER Cluster analysis can be used to accurately and non-subjectively differentiate between normo-ovulatory women with normal ovaries and normo-ovulatory women with PCOM. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Currently, PCOM is diagnosed using a fixed threshold level, i.e. 12 or more follicles per ovary, and is one of the diagnostic criteria of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, PCOM is also encountered in normo-ovulatory women, suggesting that it could just represent a normal variant. On the other hand, recent studies have shown subtle endocrine abnormalities in women with isolated PCOM that resemble those found in women with PCOS. Because of the strong correlation between anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and follicle number, a high serum AMH level has been proposed as a surrogate marker for PCOM and could, therefore, be integrated in the diagnostic classifications for PCOS. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This was a retrospective observational cohort study. Original cohorts had been recruited for previous studies between 1998 and 2010. Two hundred ninety-seven regularly cycling women and 700 women with PCOS were eligible for inclusion. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Cluster analysis was performed in 297 regularly cycling women. After exclusion of 'PCOM' clusters, each 'non-PCOM' cluster (young, n = 118 and old, n = 100) was included in the construction of a receiver operating characteristics curve to test the diagnostic performance of follicle number per ovary (FNPO) and serum AMH in discriminating similarly aged full-blown PCOS patients (n = 411 and 237, respectively) from normal regularly cycling non-PCOM women. MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE The optimal number of clusters was four; age was the most important classifying variable, followed by the FNPO and serum AMH. Two distinct clusters of normo-ovulatory women with PCOM were isolated and differed solely by age, i.e. 'young' and 'old'. Both 'PCOM' clusters had their similarly aged counterpart of 'non-PCOM' clusters. Likewise, two clusters comprised women younger than 30 years, with (n = 28, 'PCOM regularly cycling women') or without (n = 118, 'normal regularly cycling women') features of PCOM (increased FNPO and/or serum AMH). The two other clusters in older women could be labelled 'normal regularly cycling women' or 'PCOM regularly cycling women' (n = 100 and 51, respectively). The prevalence of PCOM was significantly greater in old than in young regularly cycling women controls. In the young population, after exclusion of the 'PCOM regularly cycling women', the diagnostic performance of AMH, expressed by area under the curve (AUC) (AUC = 0.903; CI (0.876-0.930)) to differentiate PCOS women from normal regularly cycling women was similar to that using the FNPO (AUC = 0.915, CI (0.891-0.940)) (P = 0.25), confirming results from earlier studies. In the old population, the diagnostic performance of AMH was greater than that of FNPO (AUCs = 0.948 (0.927-0.970) vs 0.874 (0.836-0.912), respectively, P = 0.00035). Cut-off levels of AMH and antral follicle count distinguishing regularly cycling non-PCOM women from PCOS women were higher in young women than in older women. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Data of normal women were obtained from earlier studies, aiming to measure normal endocrine values. Apparently, the strong effect of age in cluster analysis revealed a dichotomy in the age distribution among the cohort of regularly cycling women included. This was involuntary since in none of the original studies, eligibility was limited by age and there was considerable overlap in age ranges of the cohorts. Transvaginal ultrasound was performed using a 6.5-8 mHz probe and our data confirm that this threshold level for FNPO is still valid if using such probe frequencies, although the use of devices with a maximum frequency lower than 8 mHz has become obsolete. Obviously, newer ultrasound scanner using higher transducer frequency will facilitate the detection of more follicles. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Our data support the use of AMH as a surrogate for ultrasound to define PCOM, which is one of the three items of the Rotterdam classification. They also show that age should be taken into account to define the optimal threshold. The fact that the prevalence of PCOM was increased in the older regularly cycling women, may be due to 'attenuated' PCOS, a phenomenon that has been described in ageing women with PCOS. These women might have had anovulatory cycles in the past and have become ovulatory with increasing age, and were, therefore, eligible for this study. However, since most women included at older age have had spontaneous pregnancies in the past, PCOM at older age may be associated with a subclinical form of PCOS, which may also be present in young regularly cycling women.

N2  - Background and Objective: A limited number of studies have evaluated the relationship between clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism (HA). This study aimed to evaluate the association between biochemical hyperandrogenism parameters (BHPs) and Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) score in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): We searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect and Web of Sciences databases (2000-2015) to identify studies investigating clinical and biochemical parameters of HA in PCOS patients. In this meta-analysis, both fixed and random effect models were applied to estimate pooled effect size. To assess the relationships between BHPs and FG score, meta-regression analysis was used. Result(s): Fifty-five study groups with a total of 6593 PCOS patients were analysed. Meta-regression analysis of pooled data from all eligible studies showed significant positive relationships of FG score with androstenedione (A4) (P=.034) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) (P=.012), whereas it showed no association with total testosterone (tT), free testosterone (fT), sex hormone bonding globulin (SHBG) and free androgen index (FAI). The results did not change after adjusting for quality assessment or method of assay. Nor did the associations between A4 and FG score remain after adjusting for age and BMI, diagnostic criteria for PCOS and study design or the association between DHEAS and FG score remain after adjusting for ethnicity. Conclusion(s): This meta-analysis confirmed the associations of some BHPs, including A4 and DHEAS with FG score, indicating that measurement of these parameters can be useful for managing PCOS patients with hirsutism.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Background The biological mechanisms underlying the sex-related differences in risk of heart failure are still not well understood. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the current evidence on the association between reproductive factors and risk of heart failure in women. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted. PubMed and Embase databases were searched for publications on the following reproductive factors as potential risk factors for heart failure in women: age at menarche, duration and frequency of the menstrual cycle, reproductive lifespan, use of contraception, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), pregnancy characteristics (e.g. parity), pregnancy complications (e.g. preeclampsia), induced abortion, history of breastfeeding, fertility status, use of assisted reproductive methods, hysterectomy, age at menopause, and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Results Twenty-one studies were eligible for inclusion. Hypertensive pregnancy disorders, preterm delivery or small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants, shorter reproductive duration, and early menopause were risk factors for heart failure in women. It was suggested that PCOS, fertility therapy, gestational diabetes, and age at first pregnancy were not related to risk of heart failure, but a potential relation cannot be fully excluded as most studies were not of sufficient quality. Conflicting results were found for the associations between risk of heart failure and hysterectomy, gravidity and parity, and HRT. Conclusion Although some reproductive factors were considered risk factors for heart failure in women, the results were mostly conflicting or inconclusive. Further research is needed to confirm and expand the current evidence on the association between reproductive factors and risk of heart failure.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background/Aims: Although increased serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level has been suggested to be a surrogate marker of polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM), its association with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is controversial, and its diagnostic value has not been determined. We aimed to observe the relationship between the AMH level and PCOS phenotypes and to determine the optimal cutoff value of AMH for the diagnosis of PCOS in young Korean women. Method(s): We recruited 207 women with PCOS (120 with PCOM and 87 without PCOM) and 220 regular cycling women with normoandrogenemia (100 with PCOM and 120 without PCOM). Subjects underwent testing at a single outpatient visit. Serum AMH level was measured. Result(s): Women with PCOS had higher serum AMH levels than did regular cycling women with normoandrogenemia (p < 0.05). Women with PCOM had higher serum AMH levels than women without PCOM, regardless of PCOS status (p < 0.05). The optimal AMH cutoff value for the diagnosis of PCOS was 10.0 ng/mL (71% sensitivity, 93% specificity). Serum AMH was an independent determinant of total testosterone after adjustment for age, body mass index, and the number of menses/year (beta = 0.31, p < 0.01). An association between AMH and hyperandrogenism was only observed in women with PCOS, and it was independent of the presence of PCOM. Conclusion(s): The serum AMH level can be useful for the diagnosis of PCOS at any age less than 40 years, and the optimal cutoff value for the diagnosis of PCOS identified in this study of young Korean women was 10.0 ng/mL.Copyright © 2017 The Korean Association of Internal Medicine.

N2  - Background/Aims: To delineate the relationship of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obesity, and hyperandrogenism (HA) with glucose and insulin dynamics in adolescents across a broad body mass index (BMI). Method(s): Seventy-four PCOS subjects (aged 16 years) and 82 controls (aged 16 years) were evaluated by an oral glucose tolerance test. Subjects were categorized by BMI: normal weight (21 +/- 0.4), overweight/obesity (OO; 33 +/- 1.0), and severe obesity (SO; 48 +/- 1.4). Indices of glucose and insulin dynamics were determined. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the contribution of PCOS, HA, and BMI to these indices. Result(s): BMI was significantly associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure and insulin resistance. A significant interaction between BMI and PCOS and indices of post-glucose load was observed. The mean difference in peak glucose, early glucose response, area under the curve for glucose, and glucose effectiveness (SgIo) between PCOS and control subjects was significantly different between OO and SO. In PCOS subjects, testosterone was positively associated with BMI, fasting insulin, early insulin response, and diastolic blood pressure, and negatively associated with SgIo. Conclusion(s): Abnormal glucose dynamics in adolescents with PCOS is mainly due to SO. The combination of PCOS and SO has a synergistic effect on glucose dynamics when compared to all other groups.Copyright © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an ovulatory disorder that affects 6-10% of women of reproductive age. Serum AMH level may be an additional factor, or surrogate of PCOM, in the diagnostic criteria of PCOS. We evaluated the correlations between the serum AMH level and various endocrine and metabolic features in PCOS using the latest fully automated assay. Serum AMH level was compared between 114 PCOS patient (PCOS group) and 95 normal menstrual cycle women (Control group). Correlations between serum AMH level and various endocrine and metabolic factors were analysed in PCOS group. The serum AMH level was significantly higher in the PCOS group (8.35+/-8.19 ng/mL) than in the Control group (4.99+/-3.23 ng/mL). The serum AMH level was independently affected by age and the presence of PCOS on multiple regression analysis. Ovarian volume per ovary (OPVO) showed the strongest positive correlation (r=0.62) with the serum AMH level among related factors. On receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the cut-off value of AMH for the diagnosis of PCOS was 7.33 ng/mL, but this value did not have high efficacy (sensitivity 44.7%, specificity 76.8%). A cut-off value of 10 ng/mL had a high specificity of 92.6%, although the sensitivity was low (24.6%). The serum AMH level was elevated and reflected ovarian size in PCOS patients. The serum AMH level could be a surrogate for ultrasound findings of the ovaries in PCOS and might be useful for estimating ovarian findings without transvaginal ultrasound in the diagnosis of PCOS.Copyright © The Japan Endocrine Society.

N2  - Background: We and others have observed that young girls predisposed to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) display defective insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) suppressibility during early pubertal years, compared to controls. Our objective is to assess whether these differences in glucose and NEFA metabolisms persist after 5years in late/post-puberty. Method(s): We conducted a prospective cohort study between 2007 and 2015 with 4-6years of follow-up in an academic institution research center. We compared 8 daughters and sisters of PCOS women (PCOSr) to 8 age-matched girls unrelated to PCOS (+/-1.5years). Girls were assessed initially at 8-14 years old and re-assessed after a median follow-up of 5.4years, at 13-21 years old. Our main measures were a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSivGTT)-derived insulin sensitivity (IS) and beta-cell function (disposition index, DIFSivGTT); and indices of NEFA suppression during FSivGTT (logn-linear slope of NEFA and T50 of NEFA suppression). Result(s): At follow-up, both PCOSr and controls had similar results: IS=3.2 vs 3.4 (p=0.88), DIFSivGTT=1926 vs 1380 (p=0.44), logn-linear slope=-0.032 vs -0.032 (p=0.88) and T50NEFA=18.1 vs 20.8min (p=0.57). IS, DIFSivGTT and NEFA suppressibility were stable in PCOSr after 5years, but decreased significantly in controls (all p<0.05). Conclusion(s): Impaired metabolism observed during early puberty in girls predisposed to PCOS remains stable after 5years whereas control girls deteriorated their metabolic parameters. Therefore, both groups become comparable in late/post-puberty. Early puberty may thus represent a window during which metabolic alterations are transiently apparent in girls at risk of PCOS.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is proposed as a biomarker of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study investigated: (1) AMH concentrations in obese adolescents with PCOS versus without PCOS; (2) the relationship of AMH to sex steroid hormones, adiposity, and insulin resistance; and (3) the optimal AMH value and the multivariable prediction model to determine PCOS in obese adolescents. Methods AMH levels were measured in 46 obese PCOS girls and 43 obese non-PCOS girls. Sex steroid hormones, clamp-measured insulin sensitivity and secretion, body composition, and abdominal adiposity were evaluated. Logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses were used, and multivariate prediction models were developed to test the utility of AMH for the diagnosis of PCOS. Results AMH levels were higher in obese PCOS versus non-PCOS girls (8.3 +/-.6 vs. 4.3 +/-.4 ng/mL, p < .0001), of comparable age and puberty. AMH concentrations correlated positively with age in both groups, total and free testosterone in PCOS girls only, abdominal adipose tissue in non-PCOS girls, with no correlation to in vivo insulin sensitivity and secretion in either groups. A multivariate model including AMH (cutoff 6.26 ng/mL, area under the curve.788) together with sex hormone-binding globulin and total testosterone exhibited 93.4% predictive power for diagnosing PCOS. Conclusions AMH may be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of PCOS in obese adolescent girls.Copyright © 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

N2  - Objective: Due to its consistent elevation in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and correlation with polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM), anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) has been proposed as a marker of the syndrome. However, prior studies reporting thresholds of AMH for a PCOS diagnosis have been limited by small sample size, inappropriate controls, and heterogeneous AMH assays. We sought to evaluate the suitability of a standardized AMH assay as a biomarker of PCOS. Design(s): Cross-sectional study at academic medical centres across the United States. Patient(s): Women with PCOS were diagnosed by Rotterdam criteria and included 282 subjects from the multisite PPCOS II trial and 109 patients from a tertiary academic centre's multidisciplinary PCOS clinic. Controls included 245 participants in the ovarian ageing (OVA) study, a community-based cohort of ovulatory women not seeking treatment for fertility. Measurements: Determination of AMH by a central laboratory. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to investigate the accuracy of AMH thresholds for prediction of PCOS diagnosis with stratification by age. Result(s): The optimal threshold of AMH to distinguish PCOS from controls was 55.36 pmol/L (sensitivity: 0.82, specificity: 0.78, J: 0.60). When examining the population by age groups, the optimal AMH threshold decreased with increasing age. Conclusion(s): AMH is an effective biomarker of PCOS. Age-stratified thresholds more accurately predicted PCOS than an overall population-based threshold.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance and obesity. Prospective population-based data regarding development and possible predictors of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in PCOS are limited. Design(s): National Patient Register-based study. Method(s): Patients with PCOS [PCOS Denmark and embedded cohort, PCOS Odense University Hospital (OUH)] and a control population with no previous diagnosis of T2D. PCOS OUH (N = 1,162) included premenopausal women with PCOS and standardized clinical and biochemical examination. PCOS Denmark (N = 18,477) included women with PCOS in the Danish National Patient Register. Three age-matched controls were included per patient (N = 54,680). Main outcome: T2D events according to diagnosis codes and filled medicine prescriptions. Result(s): The median (quartiles) follow-up was 11.1 (6.9 to 16.0) years. The hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for development of T2D in PCOS Denmark was HR = 4.0 (95% CI, 3.7 to 4.3; P, 0.001), and the total event rate of T2D was 8.0 per 1000 person years in PCOS Denmark vs 2.0 per 1000 person years in controls (P, 0.001). The median age at diagnosis of T2D was 31 (26 to 37) years in PCOS Denmark vs 35 (27 to 44) years in controls (P, 0.001). In multiple regression analyses, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, 2-hour blood glucose, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and triglycerides were positively associated with development of T2D, whereas higher number of births was negatively associated with development of T2D. Conclusion(s): The event rate of T2D was higher in PCOS compared with controls, and T2D was diagnosed at a younger age.Copyright © 2017 Endocrine Society.

N2  - Objective To determine age-based criteria for polycystic ovary morphology. Design Cross-sectional, case-control design. Setting Outpatient setting. Subject(s) Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) defined by hyperandrogenism and irregular menses (n = 544) and controls with regular menses and no evidence of hyperandrogenism (n = 666) participated. Parameters were tested in a second cohort of women with PCOS (n = 105) and controls (n = 32) meeting the same criteria. Intervention(s) Subjects underwent a pelvic ultrasound documenting ovarian volume and maximum follicle number in a single plane. Main Outcome Measure(s) A receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed to determine the ovarian volume and follicle number with the best sensitivity and specificity to define PCOS for age groups at approximately 5-year intervals from age 18 to >44 years. Result(s) The best sensitivity and specificity were obtained using a threshold volume of 12 mL and 13 follicles for ages <=24 years, 10 mL and 14 follicles for ages 25-29 years, 9 mL and 10 follicles for ages 30-34 years, 8 mL and 10 follicles for ages 35-39 years, 10 mL and 9 follicles for ages 40-44 years, and 6 mL and 7 follicles for ages >44 years. Data from a second cohort confirmed the need to decrease volume and follicle number with increasing age to diagnose PCOS. Polycystic ovary morphology was most accurate at predicting the PCOS diagnosis for women ages 30-39 years. Conclusion(s) The ovarian volume and follicle number threshold to define polycystic ovary morphology should be lowered starting at age 30.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - Objective: To examine the relationship between anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and the severity of the phenotype of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and whether AMH can act as a diagnostic marker for PCOS?. Design(s): A prospective diagnostic utility study of AMH as a marker of PCOS. Patient(s): A consecutive series of women presenting to a tertiary infertility clinic (n = 164) plus a second series of women prepared for assisted conception treatments (n = 89) recruited between June 2012 and May 2013. Measurements: Polycystic ovary syndrome was diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria. AMH was measured using the Generation II assay (Beckman Coulter). The diagnostic utility of AMH was established using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Cut-off values for the individual features of PCOS are proposed. Result(s): There was a significant difference in serum AMH concentration in women with normal ovaries (13.2 pmol/l), polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) alone (37.8 pmol/l) and PCOS (53.2 pmol/l). Follicle number, increasing cycle length and evidence of hyperandrogenism were all independently associated with serum AMH concentration (P < 0.01). AMH was significantly affected by the different phenotypic presentations of PCOS with those with all components (PCOM, HA and OA) having the highest mean value [72.7 pmol/l (P < 0.01)]. Conclusion(s): Serum AMH has the capacity to act as a diagnostic test for PCOS. Moreover, since its value rises with the more marked phenotypes, different cut-off values need to be used to differentiate those patients with polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM), hyperandrogenism (HA) and oligoanovulation (OA).Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Objective To study the incidence rate and hazard ratios of diabetes and prediabetes between women with PCOS and healthy subjects. Design Prospective population-based study. Setting Not applicable. Patient(s) Women with PCOS (n = 178) and eumenorrheic, nonhirsute, healthy women as controls (n = 1,524), all followed for a median time of 12.9 years. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Incidence rate and hazard ratios of diabetes and prediabetes between women with PCOS and healthy controls. Result(s) We analyzed the participants on two pathways. First, for detecting new diabetes mellitus (DM) events, we selected participants who were free of DM at baseline (n = 39). Second, for detecting new pre-DM events, we selected participants who were free of pre-DM and DM at baseline (n = 222) from the baseline population. The rest of the population were included for final analysis to calculate the incidence rates and hazard ratio of diabetes and prediabetes events. The incidence rates of diabetes were 12.9 and 4.9 per 1,000 person-years for PCOS and controls, respectively. This incidence rate in women younger than 40 with and without PCOS was 13.4 and 4.2, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for women <=40 was 4.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-9.3). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups studied after age 40. The incidence rates of prediabetes were 29.7 and 25.9 per 1,000 person-years for PCOS and healthy women, respectively. The incidence rate in women younger than 40 with and without PCOS was 30.3 and 23.9, respectively. The adjusted HR for women <=40 years, 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1-2.6), disappeared after age 40. Conclusion(s) These data suggest that routine screening for diabetes in prevention strategies does not need to be emphasized for PCOS patients at late reproductive ages if they have not been affected by glucose intolerance up to that point.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - Objective To compare total antimullerian hormone (AMH), proAMH, AMHN,C, and the ratio of the two forms in predictive models for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis. Total AMH consists of proAMH (inactive precursor) and AMHN,C (receptor-competent), but neither isoform has been tested individually for their ability to predict PCOS diagnosis. Design Cross-sectional study using biobanked samples collected between July 2008 and January 2010. Setting Not applicable. Patient(s) Overweight, premenopausal women aged 18-45 years with PCOS (n = 45, with 21 fulfilling National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria and 24 fulfilling European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE) criteria, but not National Institutes of Health criteria) and without PCOS (n = 23 controls). Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Serum concentrations of proAMH and total AMH (proAMH and AMHN,C combined) were determined by immunoassay. The AMHN,C concentrations were calculated by subtraction ([AMHN,C] = [total AMH] - [proAMH]). Relative levels of proAMH were expressed as the AMH prohormone index (API = [ProAMH]/[Total AMH] x 100). Result(s) In women with PCOS, total AMH, proAMH, and AMHN,C levels were higher, and the API was lower (P=.010), than in controls indicating increased conversion of proAMH to AMHN,C. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis for proAMH (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.82), AMHN,C (AUC = 0.86), and API (AUC = 0.70) did not improve the prediction for PCOS when compared with total AMH (AUC = 0.86). Conclusion(s) The proAMH and AMHN,C do not appear to improve the ability to predict a diagnosis of PCOS beyond total AMH assays. However, the ratio of inactive proAMH precursor to receptor-competent AMHN,C (API) differs in women with PCOS relative to unaffected controls indicating that AMH signaling mechanisms may be altered in women with PCOS.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - Study objective Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common multifaceted disorder found among females of the reproductive age presenting major clinical conditions of hirsutism, oligomenorrhea and infertility. Socioeconomic studies from India have observed PCOS as a lifestyle disorder highly prevalent among middle and high income urban population as compared to rural population. A large ethnographic study that identifies the prevalence of PCOS among different socioeconomic groups would be greatly helpful to reiterate women about lifestyle modifications. Design Cross - sectional survey study. Setting Random from the general population. Materials and methods A survey was taken up by 502 young women (between 18 and 24 years) from Chennai and collectively 566 girls from Thiruvallur and Dindugal districts to represent urban and rural population respectively. The responses were entered into an excel workbook and were analyzed statistically for correlation of influencing parameters and manifestation of the disorder. Main outcome measures From our survey, we have identified a PCOS prevalence rate of 6% in south India, according to the Rotterdam criteria. We have observed that the odds of urban women prone to acquiring PCOS are 0.1 times higher than women in rural India. Major conclusions Family history was found to have a strong association in incidence and manifestation of the disorder. Stress was found to set off the symptoms pertaining to PCOS. We also noticed that the awareness, among the rural population especially, was very minimum and thus they were not oblivious of diagnosis.Copyright © 2017 Middle East Fertility Society

N2  - Context: Daughters of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are thought to be at increased risk for developing stigmata of the syndrome, but the ontogeny during puberty is uncertain. Objective(s): We phenotyped daughters (n = 76) of mothers with PCOS and daughters (n = 80) from control mothers for reproductive and metabolic parameters characteristic of PCOS. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): We performed a matched case/control study at Penn State Hershey Medical Center that included non-Hispanic, white girls 4 to 17 years old. Intervention(s): We obtained birth history, biometric, ovarian ultrasounds, whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan for body composition, 2-hour glucose challenged salivary insulin levels, and two timed urinary collections (12 hours overnight and 3 hours in the morning) for gonadotropins and sex steroids. Main Outcome Measure(s): We measured integrated urinary levels of adrenal (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) and ovarian [testosterone (TT)] steroids. Other endpoints included integrated salivary insulin levels and urinary luteinizing hormone levels. Result(s): There were no differences in detection rates or mean levels for gonadotropins and sex steroids in timed urinary collections between PCOS daughters and control daughters, nor were there differences in integrated salivary insulin levels. Results showed that 69% of Tanner 4/5 PCOS daughters vs 31% of control daughters had hirsutism defined as a Ferriman-Gallwey score >8 (P = 0.04). There were no differences in body composition as determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry between groups in the three major body contents (i.e., bone, lean body mass, and fat) or in ovarian volume between groups. Conclusion(s): Matched for pubertal stage, PCOS daughters have similar levels of urinary androgens and gonadotropins as well as glucose-challenged salivary insulin levels.Copyright © 2017 by the Endocrine Society.

N2  - This was a prospective cross-sectional study in which 126 female students between the ages of 18 and 30 years were evaluated for the frequency of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) through clinical interview, questionnaire, and anthropometric measurements. The diagnostic criteria of the US National Institutes of Health criteria were used. Menstrual irregularities (MI) were identified, and clinical hyperandrogenism was evaluated by self-assessment of hirsutism using modified Ferriman-Gallwey score. Blood analysis was done for measurement of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and the androgen hormones. Of all the students, 37 (30.8%) had MI, 38 (31.7%) had clinical hirsutism, 37 (30.8%) had acne, and 76 (63.3%) had a family history of type 2 diabetes. The estimated frequency of PCOS was 18.33% according to the US National Institutes of Health definition. Hormonal analysis demonstrated a significant increase in androgens (total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and free testosterone), and a significant decrease in sex hormone-binding globulin in our PCOS group, with a P-value <0.05. This study revealed a higher level of the androgen hormones among PCOS subjects with a frequency of PCOS (18.33%) similar to the global estimates of 10%-20%.Copyright © 2017 Sharif et al.

N2  - Clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism is one of the diagnostic criteria for PCOS. An evaluation of the role of salivary testosterone (salT) and androstenedione (salA) for the diagnosis of PCOS was undertaken in a cross sectional study involving 65 women without PCOS and 110 women with PCOS fulfilling all 3 diagnostic Rotterdam criteria. Serum and salivary androgen measurements were determined by LC-MS/MS. salT and salA were significantly elevated in PCOS compared to controls (P<001). No androgen marker was more predictive than another using ROC curves, but multiple logistic regression suggested salT was more predictive than free androgen index (FAI) (p<0.01). The combination of salT or FAI identified 100% of PCOS women. PCOS women with both biochemical and clinical hyperandrogenism as opposed to clinical hyperandrogenism alone showed a metabolic phenotype (p<0.05) and insulin resistance (p<0.001). PCOS patients with an isolated elevated FAI showed increased insulin resistance compared to those with an isolated salT (P<0.05). salT appeared to be at least as predictive as FAI for the diagnosis of the classical PCOS phenotype, and the combination of salT or FAI identified 100% of PCOS patients. This suggests that salT measurement by LC-MS/MS holds the promise of complementing existing laboratory tests as a means of assessing hyperandrogenemia.

N2  - Background: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have greater cardiac risk factor clustering but the link with mortality is incompletely described. Objective(s): To evaluate outcomes in 295 postmenopausal women enrolled in the National Institutes of Health-National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NIH-NHLBI) sponsored Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) study according to clinical features of PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 25/295 (8%) women had clinical features of PCOS defined by a premenopausal history of irregular menses and current biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenemia, defined as the top quartile of androstenedione (>=701 pg/mL), testosterone (>=30.9 ng/dL), or free testosterone (>=4.5 pg/mL). Cox proportional hazard model estimated death (n = 80). Result(s): Women with clinical features of PCOS had an earlier menopause (p = 0.01), were more often smokers (p < 0.04), and trended toward more angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD) (p = 0.07) than women without these features. Cumulative 10-year mortality was 28% for women with (n = 25) versus 27% without clinical features of PCOS (n = 270) (p = 0.85). PCOS was not a significant predictor (p = NS) in prognostic models including diabetes, waist circumference, hypertension, and angiographic CAD. Conclusion(s): From this longer-term follow up of a relatively small cohort of postmenopausal women with suspected ischemia, the prevalence of PCOS is similar to the general population, and clinical features of PCOS are not associated with CAD or mortality. These findings question whether identification of clinical features of PCOS in postmenopausal women who already have known cardiovascular disease provides any additional opportunity for risk factor intervention.© Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.

N2  - Objective Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrinological disorders in women of reproductive age, and is characterized by hyperandrogenism. It is associated with long-term metabolic dysfunctions including sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). We hypothesized that the increased prevalence of SDB in PCOS results from raised testosterone levels. Methods This was a prospective, cross-sectional, case-control study in which 50 case patients with untreated PCOS and 100 control subjects were included. All the case patients and control subjects went through a detailed clinical, biochemical, and hormonal evaluation. Overnight polysomnography was performed in all case patients and the snorers (16 of 100) in the control group. Results SDB was seen in 66% of the case patients and in 4% of control group with (odds ratio [OR]=46.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]=14.6-148.4; p<0.001). After adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), the difference was not significant (p=0.993 and p=0.931, respectively). The SDB patients with PCOS showed significantly higher respiratory distress index (RDI) values than SDB patients in the control group (22.5+/-21.5 vs 9.0+/-5.6, p=0.01). On the Epworth Sleepiness Scale the PCOS case patients reported feeling more sleepy than did the control subjects (12.5+/-3.2 vs 9.32+/-1.7, p<0.001). Free testosterone levels were also significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the control subjects (2.95+/-3.44 vs 1.5+/-1.0, p<0.001). There was a significant correlation between free testosterone level and RDI values (r=0.377; p=0.007), WC (r=0.315; p=0.026), and BMI (r=0.398; p=0.004). A significant correlation of WC (r=0.551; p<0.001) and BMI (r=0.572; p<0.001) was observed with RDI. Conclusion Testosterone-induced obesity is probably the common pathway for the development of SDB in PCOS.Copyright © 2016

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the commonest endocrine disorder and cause of androgen excess in women. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) could be a new marker of hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to assess the concentration PSA (total PSA - TPSA and free PSA - fPSA) in 165 patients with PCOS and 40 healthy female controls, the relationship between PSA (TPSA and fPSA) and hormonal parameters and to determine the performance of PSA in diagnosis of PCOS. Result(s): Total PSA was higher in PCOS group versus controls. The fPSA was below the lower detection levels among all patients. The median value of FAI was 4.31 in PCOS patients versus 1.79 in controls, p < 0.001. There was a correlation of TPSA and tT (r= 0.173, p = 0.027) and TPSA and FAI (r = 0.2603, p = 0.001). AUC for FAI was 82.1%, threshold 2.56 nmol/l, for tT AUC 80.5%, threshold 0.54 ng/ml, for TPSA AUC 66.3%, threshold 0.005 ng/ml. The ROC analysis for A AUC 62.7%, threshold 3.95 ng/ml. Conclusion(s): PCOS women have higher serum concentration of TPSA than controls. TPSA positively correlate with T and FAI, which is the best marker for hyperandrogenic states and has better accuracy for tT and total PSA serum levels in diagnostic of PCOS.Copyright © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heritable, complex genetic disease. Animal models suggest that androgen exposure at critical developmental stages contributes to disease pathogenesis. We hypothesized that genetic variation resulting in increased androgen production produces the phenotypic features of PCOS by programming during critical developmental periods. Although we have not found evidence for increased in utero androgen levels in cord blood in the daughters of women with PCOS (PCOS-d), target tissue androgen production may be amplified by increased 5alpha-reductase activity analogous to findings in adult affected women. It is possible to noninvasively test this hypothesis by examining urinary steroid metabolites. Objective(s): We performed this study to investigate whether PCOS-d have altered androgen metabolism during early childhood. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Twenty-one PCOS-d, 1-3 years old, and 36 control girls of comparable age were studied at an academic medical center. Main Outcome Measure(s): Urinary steroid metabolites were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Twenty-four hour steroid excretion rates and precursor to product ratios suggestive of 5alpha-reductase and 11beta;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities were calculated. Result(s): Age did not differ but weight for length Z-scores were higher in PCOS-d compared to control girls (P = .02). PCOS-d had increased 5alpha-tetrahydrocortisol:tetrahydrocortisol ratios (P = .04), suggesting increased global 5alpha-reductase activity. There was no evidence for differences in 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity. Steroid metabolite excretion was not correlated with weight. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that differences in androgen metabolism are present in early childhood in PCOS-d. Increased 5alpha-reductase activity could contribute to the development of PCOS by amplifying target tissue androgen action.

N2  - Aim The aim of this study was to determine the correlation of clinical hyperandrogenism and biochemical hyperandrogenism (hyperandrogenemia) in Thai women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand. Subjects were 145 women with PCOS who were diagnosed in accordance with the revised Rotterdam 2003 criteria and registered during January to July 2008. Clinical hyperandrogenism was assessed using the modified Ferriman-Gallwey score for hirsutism, the American Academy of Dermatology criteria for severity of acne, and the Ludwig scale for androgenic alopecia and virilization. Biochemical hyperandrogenism was determined from serum concentration of total testosterone (TT), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and free testosterone (FT). Results The participants had a mean age of 25.5 +/- 6.5 years and a body mass index of 26.2 +/- 6.9 kg/m2. The most common presenting symptom was oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. The most common expression of clinical hyperandrogenism was acne (56.6%). Most of the participants (84.8%) had high serum-FT. There was a statistically significant correlation between clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism in the following pairs: hirsutism and FT (r = 0.3, P < 0.001); hirsutism and TT (r = 0.26, P < 0.001); and acne and TT (r = 0.26, P = 0.002). The others had little or no correlations. Conclusion Clinical hyperandrogenism is not a good predictor for biochemical hyperandrogenism in Thai women with PCOS. A modified Ferriman-Gallwey score cut-off point of 8 has low sensitivity but high specificity for hyperandrogenemia; therefore, it is useful for the diagnosis but not useful for the exclusion of hyperandrogenemia in Thai women with PCOS.Copyright © 2016 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

N2  - Background/Aims: We aimed to investigate whether the anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), PCOS risk, and isolated oligomenorrhea (OM) were different than in adolescents with a normal/regular menstrual cycle (NMC). Method(s): The diagnosis of PCOS was based on the 2012 Amsterdam [European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM)] criteria. The PCOS group consisted of cases meeting 3 diagnostic criteria (n = 21), and the PCOS risk group was the 'at risk' group meeting 2 diagnostic criteria (n = 20). Cases with isolated OM that did not satisfy other PCOS diagnostic criteria made up the OM group (n = 21). Thirty adolescent girls with NMCs (21-45 days) were recruited in this study. Result(s): The AMH levels in the PCOS group were similar to those in the PCOS risk group but significantly higher than those in the OM and NMC groups. The AMH levels in the PCOS risk group were similar to those in the OM group and significantly higher than those in the NMC group. They were also significantly higher in the OM group compared to the NMC group. The specificity for PCOS and PCOS risk with a cutoff value of 7.25 ng/ml for AMH was 72.5% and the sensitivity was 58%. Conclusion(s): An AMH cutoff value of 7.25 ng/ml can be used for the diagnosis of PCOS in the adolescent period.Copyright © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess the value of serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in various phenotypes and to assess ovarian ultrasound parameters., METHODS: We performed a retrospective matched controlled study of 113 females with various PCOS phenotypes and 47 matched controls. The diagnostic utility of AMH measurement and ovarian ultrasound were compared. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, the threshold for AMH (>4.7 ng/mL) and ultrasound parameters (follicle number per ovary [FNPO] >22 and ovarian volume [OV] >8 cc) were established., RESULTS: In the entire cohort, AMH had a low sensitivity of 79%; while FNPO and OV were 93% and 68%, respectively. Specificities ranged from 85 to 96%. In classic anovulatory PCOS, AMH exhibited a sensitivity of 91%, and for FNPO and OV the corresponding sensitivities were 92% and 72%. In the ovulatory phenotype, AMH sensitivity was only 50%, while FNPO and OV were 95% and 50%, respectively. In the nonhyperandrogenic phenotype, the sensitivity of AMH was 53% while those for FNPO and OV were 93% and 67%., CONCLUSION: AMH does not appear to be helpful for all subjects with PCOS but may be of some value in those who are anovulatory. However, FNPO was highly sensitive in all phenotypes, and was the single best criterion assessed for all subjects, suggesting the important role of ultrasound.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and cancer, especially of the endometrium, breast and ovary., METHODS: The Danish National Patient Register was used to identify 12,070 in- and outpatients in whom PCOS was diagnosed when they were aged 9-49 years during 1977-2012. Using the Danish Cancer Registry, we followed the cohort through 2012 and compared the women's cancer incidence with that of the general Danish female population by means of standardized incidence ratios (SIRs)., CONCLUSION: The results of this large cohort study support those of case-control studies showing that women with PCOS are at increased risk for endometrial cancer, whereas their risks for breast and ovarian cancer are similar to those of women in the general population. Our finding that women with PCOS also are at increased risk for cancers of the kidney, colon and brain requires further study., RESULTS: Cancer was diagnosed in 279 women with PCOS (SIR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.06-1.34). We found an almost fourfold increased risk for endometrial cancer (numbers observed (N) = 16, SIR = 3.9; 95% CI = 2.2-6.3), the large majority of cases being type 1 (N = 14, SIR = 4.7; 95% CI = 2.6-7.9). We found no association between PCOS and breast (N = 59, SIR = 1.1; 95% CI = 0.8-1.4) or ovarian cancer (N = 10, SIR = 1.8; 95% CI = 0.8-3.2); however, significantly increased risks were found for kidney, colon and brain cancers.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - The potential implications of a PCOS diagnosis on a woman's long-term health using data linkage
A1  - Hart R.
A1  - Doherty D.A. 
Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Context: The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the commonest endocrine abnormality in women of reproductive age. Objective(s): To determine the rate of hospital admissions for women with PCOS in Western Australian population in comparison to women without PCOS. Design(s): A population-based retrospective cohort study using data linkage in a statewide hospital morbidity database system. Setting(s): All hospitals within Western Australia. Participant(s): A total of 2566 women with PCOS hospitalized from 1997-2011 and 25 660 randomly selected age-matched women without a PCOS diagnosis derived from the electoral roll. Main Outcome Measure(s): Hospitalizations by ICD-10-M diagnoses from 15 years were compared. Result(s): Hospitalizations were followed until a median age of 35.8 years (interquartile range, 31.0-39.9). PCOS was associated with more nonobstetric and non-injury-related hospital admissions (median, 5 vs 2; P < .001), a diagnosis of adult-onset diabetes (12.5 vs 3.8%), obesity (16.0 vs 3.7%), hypertensive disorder (3.8 vs 0.7%), ischemic heart disease (0.8 vs 0.2%), cerebrovascular disease (0.6 vs 0.2%), arterial and venous disease (0.5 vs 0.2% and 10.4 vs 5.6%, respectively), asthma (10.6 vs 4.5%), stress/anxiety (14.0 vs 5.9%), depression (9.8 vs 4.3%), licit/illicit drug-related admissions (8.8 vs 4.5%), self-harm (7.2 vs 2.9%), land transport accidents (5.2 vs 3.8%), and mortality (0.7 vs 0.4%) (all P < .001). Women with PCOS had a higher rate of admissions for menorrhagia (14.1 vs 3.6%), treatment of infertility (40.9 vs 4.6%), and miscarriage (11.1 vs 6.1%) and were more likely to require in vitro fertilization (17.2 vs 2.0%). Conclusion(s): PCOS has profound medical implications for the health of women, and health care resources should be directed accordingly.Copyright © 2015 by the Endocrine Society.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate serum concentration of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in adolescent patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with respect to body mass index (BMI), and to investigate the relationship with clinical, metabolic and hormonal parameters. Study design: Fifty-eight adolescent girls (29 normal weight and 29 overweight-obese) diagnosed with PCOS and 28 apparently healthy girls (controls) were enrolled in the study. BMI was calculated in all cases. Serum AMH, hormonal and metabolic parameters were compared between patients with PCOS (normal weight and overweight-obese) and controls. Result(s): Serum AMH did not differ between patients with PCOS and controls (p = 0.283), and no correlation was found between BMI and AMH. A significant positive correlation was found between 2-h plasma glucose on 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and AMH (R = 0.364, p = 0.005). HOMA-IR index and insulin were significantly higher in overweight-obese patients with PCOS than in controls, but no significant difference was found between controls and normal-weight patients with PCOS. Conclusion(s): AMH was not found to be a reliable predictor for the presence of PCOS, and serum AMH did not differ between obese and non-obese adolescent patients with PCOS.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION Should fasting glucose (FG) or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) be used to screen for dysglycaemia in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? SUMMARY ANSWER A full OGTT should be recommended as the screening method for dysglycaemia in women with PCOS, regardless of BMI or family history of diabetes mellitus (DM). STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A cross-sectional study on 467 Chinese women diagnosed with PCOS by the Rotterdam criteria between January 2010 to December 2013. PARTICIPANTS, SETTING, METHODS The study was done at a university hospital in Hong Kong. All subjects underwent a 75 g OGTT after overnight fasting. We evaluated the performance of FG alone, when compared with the full OGTT, in identifying subjects with dysglycaemia (prediabetes or DM, according to the 2010 diagnostic criteria of the American Diabetes Association). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Of the 467 subjects, 58 (12.4%) had dysglycaemia, among which 46 (9.8%) had prediabetes and 12 (2.6%) had DM, including 4 with known DM. Of the 46 subjects with prediabetes, 25 (54.3%) had normal FG and of the 8 subjects with screened DM in this study, 1 (12.5%) had normal FG. The sensitivity of FG alone in screening for prediabetes, DM and overall dysglycaemia were 45.7, 87.5 and 48.1%, respectively, i.e. missing 54.3% of prediabetes and 12.5% of DM cases as defined by the OGTT. Among the 54 subjects with screened dysglycaemia, 20 (37.0%) had BMI < 25 kg/m2 and 35 (64.8%) had no family history of DM. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION We only reported on the biochemical diagnosis of DM based on a single time point. In clinical practice, confirmatory results at another time point is required for definitive diagnosis in asymptomatic subjects. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS There is an ongoing debate as to whether FG or an OGTT should be used as a screening method for dysglycaemia in women with PCOS. Some guidelines also recommend glucose screening only in those who are overweight and/or having family history of diabetes (DM). There have been scarce data on this issue in the Chinese population, which the current study aims at addressing.Copyright © The Author 2015.

N2  - Background: Female abdominal obesity is associated with hyperandrogenemia (HA), but few studies have addressed the possible association between HA and metabolic syndrome (MetS) among obese women. Some studies indicate that insulin resistance may cause HA through different mechanisms. On the other hand, a bidirectional relationship between HA and insulin resistance has been suggested. Thus, we aimed to investigate if morbidly obese women with HA had higher odds of MetS and its components than those without HA (controls), independent of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) status. Method(s): This cross-sectional study comprised 1900 consecutive treatment seeking morbidly obese women <50 years. Free testosterone index (FTI) >0.6 defined HA. Women with previously diagnosed PCOS and those with oligo- / anovulation combined with clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism were defined as having PCOS. Multiadjusted associations between HA and MetS were assessed by logistic regression analysis. Result(s): Out of 1900 morbidly obese women, 1089 (57 %), 846 (45 %) and 312 (16 %) had MetS, HA and PCOS, respectively. Compared with controls (without HA), women with HA were younger (34 [1] years vs. 39 [2], p<0.001) had a higher prevalence of MetS (62 % vs. 53 %, p<0.001), type 2 diabetes (18 % vs. 15 %, p=0.045), low HDL-cholesterol (65 % vs. 48 %, p<0.001) and hypertriglyceridemia (48 % vs. 41 %, p=0.004), but a lower prevalence of raised blood pressure (53 % vs. 59 %, p=0.014). Multivariable analyses showed that HA was associated with increased odds of MetS (OR 1.61 [95 % CI 1.27, 2.02]), dysglycemia (1.65 [1.28, 2.11]), low HDL-cholesterol (1.58 [1.27, 1.97]), and hypertriglyceridemia (1.43 [1.15, 1.79]). After stratification for the presence of PCOS, the results remained largely unchanged in women without PCOS; MetS (1.52 [1.18, 1.96), dysglycemia (1.71 [1.30, 2.25]), low HDL-cholesterol (1.55 [1.22, 1.98]) and hypertriglyceridemia (1.36 [1.06, 1.74]). Conclusion(s): Morbidly obese women with HA had an approximately 1.5-fold increased odds of having MetS even in the absence of PCOS. Randomized controlled clinical trials, including therapeutic strategies to lower free testosterone levels, are however necessary to explore any cause-and-effect relationship.Copyright © 2015 Valderhaug et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

N2  - Introduction No study has examined how the relationship between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (aCVD), of ischemic stroke (ISCH), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and peripheral vascular disease (PAD), differ in the presence of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Materials and methods We performed a cross-sectional analysis using Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial databases from 2004-2011. The association between women aged 18-64 years with and without PCOS, and aCVD was assessed using VTE-stratified multivariable logistic regression models. Results Overall, women with PCOS were more likely to have aCVD, (aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10-1.46) especially ISCH (aOR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.30-1.88), than women without PCOS. When stratified by VTE status, women with PCOS and a VTE diagnosis had a decreased odds of having any aCVD (aOR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.98), and VTE diagnosis more often preceded the occurrence of ISCH and AMI among women with PCOS compared with women without PCOS. Conclusions Overall, women with PCOS were more likely to have aCVD, with stroke being the most prevalent manifestation. Although VTE often occurred before any aCVD, it appeared to have an inverse association with the development of ISCH, AMI, and PAD among women with PCOS, suggesting that aggressively treating VTE or aCVD early may limit the chances of developing the other thrombogenic condition among women with PCOS.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects around 15% of Indigenous women who are also a group at high risk of cardiometabolic disease. Aim(s): To explore the impact of PCOS on metabolic syndrome in Indigenous women. Method(s): A cross-sectional reproductive health questionnaire, biochemical and anthropometric assessments, of 109 Indigenous women (35 with PCOS and 74 without PCOS) aged 15-44years in and around Darwin between 2003 and 2005. PCOS was defined using the National Institutes of Health criteria, and metabolic syndrome (MetS) using the National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Programme III criteria. The outcome was prevalence of MetS by PCOS status; relationship of PCOS with MetS before and after adjustment for markers of obesity and insulin resistance. Result(s): Women with PCOS had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) (P=0.0001) and MetS was more frequent in women with PCOS (51%) than those without PCOS (23%) (P=0.003). The most frequent components of MetS in both groups were a high density lipoprotein cholesterol <=1.29mmol/L (80% PCOS, 55% non-PCOS) and a waist circumference >88cm (77% PCOS, 41% non-PCOS); these were significantly more frequent in women with PCOS (P=0.01). In logistic regression models, PCOS was significantly associated with MetS by itself but not after adjustment for BMI or sex hormone binding globulin. Conclusion(s): While MetS was more common in Indigenous women with PCOS, PCOS was not an independent predictor of MetS. This may be because obesity and insulin resistance are integral parts of PCOS and are the mechanisms through which PCOS exerts metabolic effects.Copyright © 2015 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.

N2  - Purpose: We aimed to assess the feasibility and reproducibility of real-time elastography (RTE) for displaying the effects of morphological changes in the ovary in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): Forty-eight patients diagnosed with PCOS and 48 healthy women were enrolled in the study. Ultrasonography and RTE were performed on the 3rd day of the menstrual cycle. Evaluations were performed independently by two radiologists. Ovarian volume, number of follicles, elasticity pattern, and strain ratio were measured. Elasticity patterns were assessed as hard (type 1; blue or blue-green), moderate (type 2; green or green-yellow) or soft (type 3; red or orange-red). Result(s): Both radiologists determined the elasticity pattern as mostly type 1 in the PCOS group and type 3 in the control group (P < 0.01). The mean strain ratios obtained by the first and second radiologist were 6.1+/-1.8 (2.7-10.1) and 6.0+/-1.5 (3.0-9.0) in PCOS and 3.3+/-1.2 (1.7-7.2) and 3.2+/-0.9 (1.7-6.8) in the control group, respectively (P < 0.001). Interobserver agreement was moderate for the elasticity pattern (kappa=0.48) and good for the strain ratio (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.77). A strain ratio of 3.8 was determined as the optimized cutoff point by receiver operating curve analysis. Strain ratio was correlated with the ovarian volume and the number of detected follicles (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Elasticity pattern and strain ratio can help identify morphological changes that make PCOS ovaries stiffer than normal ovaries.Copyright © Turkish Society of Radiology 2015.

N2  - We evaluated the association of hirsutism and oligomenorrhea (persistent menstrual cycles > 45 days) as screening criteria for the detection of biochemical hyperandrogenism (BH) and polycystic ovaries (PCOM) during adolescence and determined which androgens, granulosa cell hormone, ultrasonographic parameters have the best association with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Hirsute girls with oligomenorrhea (N = 26 Hirs/Oligo group) and non-hirsute girls with regular cycles (N = 63, C group) were studied. Prevalence of BH and PCOM, diagnostic performance of androgens and ultrasound parameters for PCOS diagnosis were analyzed. BH and PCOM prevalence were higher in the Hirs/Oligo girls than in the C girls (76.9% versus 25.5%; 92.3% versus 33.3%, respectively; p < 0.0001). A complete PCOS phenotype (Hirs/Oligo with BH and PCOM) was observed in 73.1% of the Hirs/Oligo group. The presence of both BH and PCOM was observed in 7.9% of the C group. The parameters with the best diagnostic performance were free androgen index >=6.1, testosterone >=2.4 nmol/L, follicle number >=12 and ovarian volume >=10 ml anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) exhibited a low diagnostic accuracy. Hirsutism and persistent menstrual cycle over 45 days are highly associated with BH and PCOM suggesting that the presences of both criteria are necessary for the diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Objective: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increased in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but the prevalence of other diseases is not clarified. We aimed to investigate morbidity and medicine prescriptions in PCOS. Design(s): A National Register-based study. Method(s): Patients with PCOS (PCOS Denmark and an embedded cohort; PCOS Odense University Hospital (OUH)) and one control population. Premenopausal women with PCOS underwent clinical and biochemical examination (PCOS OUH, n=1217). PCOS Denmark (n=19 199) included women with PCOS in the Danish National Patient Register. Three age-matched controls were included per patient (n=57 483). Main Outcome Measure(s): Diagnosis codes and filled prescriptions. Result(s): The mean (range) age of the PCOS Denmark group and controls was 30.6 (12-60) years. Patients in PCOS Denmark had higher Charlson index, higher prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension than controls. PCOS was associated with a two times increased risk of stroke and thrombosis, whereas the risk of other cardiovascular diseases was not increased. Thyroid disease, asthma, migraine, and depression were more prevalent in PCOS Denmark vs controls, whereas fractures were rarer. Infertility was increased in patients compared with controls, but the mean number of births was higher in PCOS. Medicine prescriptions within all diagnosis areas were significantly higher in PCOS patients than in controls. In PCOS OUH, polycystic ovaries (PCO) and irregular menses were associated with a more adverse metabolic risk profile, but individual Rotterdam criteria were not associated with cardiometabolic diagnoses. Conclusion(s): Cardiometabolic and psychiatric morbidity were significantly increased in a Danish population with PCOS. Medical diseases are frequent also in young patients with PCOS.Copyright © 2015 European Society of Endocrinology.

N2  - Objective. To assess the association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and cancer, especially of the endometrium, breast and ovary. Methods. The Danish National Patient Register was used to identify 12,070 in- and outpatients in whom PCOS was diagnosed when they were aged 9-49 years during 1977-2012. Using the Danish Cancer Registry, we followed the cohort through 2012 and compared the women's cancer incidence with that of the general Danish female population by means of standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). Results. Cancer was diagnosed in 279 women with PCOS (SIR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.06-1.34). We found an almost fourfold increased risk for endometrial cancer (numbers observed (N) = 16, SIR = 3.9; 95% CI = 2.2-6.3), the large majority of cases being type 1 (N = 14, SIR = 4.7; 95% CI = 2.6-7.9). We found no association between PCOS and breast (N = 59, SIR = 1.1; 95% CI = 0.8-1.4) or ovarian cancer (N = 10, SIR = 1.8; 95% CI = 0.8-3.2); however, significantly increased risks were found for kidney, colon and brain cancers. Conclusion. The results of this large cohort study support those of case-control studies showing that women with PCOS are at increased risk for endometrial cancer, whereas their risks for breast and ovarian cancer are similar to those of women in the general population. Our finding that women with PCOS also are at increased risk for cancers of the kidney, colon and brain requires further study.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy in premenopausal women, associated with risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD risk evaluation is recommended for PCOS patients. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of CVD in PCOS patients and to identify the best predictors for metabolic and cardiovascular disturbances., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 169 PCOS patients and 110 healthy women in reproductive age. We estimated cardiovascular risk according to American Heart Association and Androgen Excess-PCOS Society criteria that classified patients as metabolically unhealthy (MU) or metabolically healthy (MH)., RESULTS: The PCOS group had significantly higher body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio (P < 0.000001). Metabolic syndrome was only defined among PCOS patients (8.9%). No obesity was observed in the control group. Waist circumference >= 80 cm was presented in 44% of PCOS patients in comparison to 14.5% of control participants (P < 0.000001). There was a significant tendency for higher fasting insulin levels in the PCOS population (P < 0.00001). Surprisingly the PCOS-MH group had the highest high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. ROC curves were used to indicate parameters diagnosing metabolically unhealthy women and revealed that WC, BMI and HC seem to be the strongest predictors of metabolic disturbances in PCOS but in the healthy population in reproductive age biochemical findings such as low HDL or increased fasting glycemia presented stronger predictive value than patients' anthropometric features., CONCLUSIONS: Physicians need to remember to adopt different diagnostic approach while seeking metabolic complications in these different groups of women.

N2  - Methods: 80 women with PCOS diagnosed according to the Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group 2003 and 48 controls were enrolled between 2011 and 2013. PCOS patients fulfilling all Rotterdam criteria were defined as having severe PCOS (n = 59), while patients showing oligo-/amenorrhoea and polycystic ovaries but without hyperandrogenemia were defined as having mild PCOS (n = 21). All patients were treated at the University Hospital of Essen, Germany., Purpose: Features of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) including sonographic aspects, androgens, LH and LH/FSH ratio as well as Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) were evaluated according to their diagnostic potency in detecting different degrees of PCOS severity., Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the diagnostic potency of AMH, sonographic aspects, androgens, and LH/FSH ratio according to different PCOS subgroups while accounting for the age-dependency of AMH. In cases where vaginal scans are not feasible or in patients without hyperandrogenemia AMH may be used as a surrogate parameter in PCOS diagnosis, superior to androgens and gonadotropins., Results: The strongest group difference between controls and severe PCOS patients was observed for AMH showing an age-adjusted odds ratio of 2.56 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.00-3.27; p < 0.0001]. Age-adjusted receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95 % CI: 0.80-0.95) for AMH and 0.94 (95 % CI 0.88-0.98) for antral follicle count did not differ significantly in their ability to discriminate between severe PCOS patients and controls. AMH showed higher AUC estimates than androgens, ovarian volume, LH and LH/FSH ratio and an AUC of 0.80 (95 % CI: 0.65-0.91) for detecting mild PCOS.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the performance of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and ultrasound parameters, such as ovarian volume and outline, in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Study design This prospective, observational, case-controlled study included 43 women with PCOS, and 40 controls. Between day 3 and 5 of the menstrual cycle, fasting serum samples were collected and transvaginal ultrasound was performed. The diagnostic performance of each parameter [total PSA (tPSA), total-to-free PSA ratio (tPSA:fPSA), ovarian volume, ovarian outline] was estimated by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, along with area under the curve (AUC), threshold, sensitivity, specificity as well as positive (+) and negative (-) likelihood ratios (LRs). Multivariate logistical regression models, using ovarian volume and ovarian outline, were constructed. Results The tPSA and tPSA:fPSA ratio resulted in AUC of 0.74 and 0.70, respectively, with moderate specificity/sensitivity and insufficient LR+/- values. In the multivariate logistic regression model, the combination of ovarian volume and outline had a sensitivity of 97.7% and a specificity of 97.5% in the diagnosis of PCOS, with +LR and -LR values of 39.1 and 0.02, respectively. Conclusions In women with PCOS, tPSA and tPSA:fPSA ratio have similar diagnostic performance. The use of a multivariate logistic regression model, incorporating ovarian volume and outline, offers very good diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing women with PCOS patients from controls.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study included 893 patients referred for routine infertility evaluation and treatment. The patients were divided into three groups: (i) the control group (n = 621) included women with regular menstrual cycles and no signs of hyperandrogenism (HA), (ii) the full-blown PCOS group (n = 95) consisted of women who were diagnosed as having PCOS based on the presence of both HA and oligo/amenorrhoea (OA), (iii) the mild PCOS group included women with only two items of the Rotterdam classification, i.e. PCOM at ultrasonography according to the FNPO threshold of 12 or more and either OA (n = 110) or HA (n = 67)., MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: After exclusion of women with PCOM from the controls, the AMH threshold of 28 pmol/l with specificity 97.5% and sensitivity 84.2% [area under the curve (AUC) 0.948 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.915-0.982)] and FNPO threshold of 12 with specificity 92.5% and sensitivity 83.2% [AUC 0.940 (95% CI 0.909-0.971)] for identifying PCOS were derived from the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The AMH threshold of 28 pmol/l had the same specificity for discriminating the mild and the full-blown PCOS phenotypes from controls., STUDY QUESTION: Can cluster analysis can be used to identify a homogeneous subpopulation of women with polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) within a very large population of control women in a non-subjective way?, SUMMARY ANSWER: Identification and exclusion of the cluster corresponding to women with PCOM from controls improved the diagnostic power of serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level and follicle number per ovary (FNPO) in discriminating between women with or without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)., WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: There is disagreement as to whether women with PCOM should be excluded from the control population when establishing FNPO and AMH diagnostic thresholds for the definition of PCOS and how to identify such women. It has been demonstrated that cluster analysis can detect women with PCOM within the control population through a set of classifying variables among which the most relevant was AMH. The adequacy of this approach has not been confirmed in other clinical settings., STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a retrospective study using clinical and laboratory data derived from the computerized database. The data were collected from March 2011 to May 2013., LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: There was no selection bias other than being evaluated for infertility treatment, however, this could also be considered as a limitation of the study as these women may not necessarily be a representative sample of the general population. The study demonstrated that serum AMH has intrinsically a very high potency to detect women with PCOM within a control group. However, the AMH threshold is specific for this method and clinical setting., WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: AMH threshold value for the definition of PCOM is method specific and cannot be universally applied. This study confirmed the results of previous studies that cluster analysis can identify women with PCOM within the very large control population without using a predefined diagnostic threshold for FNPO, and that AMH can detect women with PCOM with a high specificity. The exclusion of PCOM women from the controls by using a cluster analysis should be considered when establishing reference intervals and decision threshold values for various parameters used to characterize PCOS., STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The authors have no funding/competing interest(s) to declare.Copyright © 2014 The Author.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. The aims of this study were to provide an estimate of the prevalence of PCOS in clinical practice; compare the risk of established cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease, and other comorbid conditions in women with PCOS to that of age- and race-matched controls; and explore the total costs of care that can be attributed to PCOS. Method(s): Louisiana Medicaid claims data were used to identify women with PCOS or its defining features and a control group in a ratio of 1:3. The prevalence of PCOS, cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, dyslipidemia, dysmetabolic syndrome, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and obesity), key comorbidities (anxiety, bipolar disorders, depression, eating disorders, infertility, obstructive sleep apnea), and diagnosed cardiovascular disease were measured. Result(s): During 2010, the prevalence of PCOS was 0.88%. Women with PCOS were more likely to have a diagnosis of diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 4.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.63Y5.21), dyslipidemia (OR, 3.56; 95% CI, 3.04Y4.19), dysmetabolic syndrome (OR, 23.46; 95% CI, 13.64Y40.36), glucose intolerance (OR, 5.46; 95% CI, 3.10Y9.60), hypertension (OR, 2.76; 95% CI, 2.41Y3.18), obesity (OR, 5.79; 95% CI, 5.07Y6.62), infertility (OR, 23.42; 95% CI, 10.63Y51.61), obstructive sleep apnea (OR, 6.47; 95% CI, 3.62Y11.55), anxiety (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.53Y2.04), bipolar disorders (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.55Y2.44), and depression (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.94Y2.54) than did controls. Average total costs of care for the year was $5551 in the PCOS group and $3496 in the control group. After controlling for the effects of other variables, the average total cost of care for PCOS was $637 higher than that of the control group. Other variables that contributed significantly to the total costs of care included race, age, acute myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, peripheral artery disease, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Conclusion(s): Although the clinical burden of PCOS is high, it is diagnosed less frequently in clinical practice compared with systematic screening studies. This is concerning considering that PCOS is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and other comorbidities. Mean total costs of care for the PCOS group was higher than the mean total costs of care for the control group. Polycystic ovary syndrome is independently associated with an increase in mean total costs of care. Copyright © 2014 by The American Federation for Medical Research.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome confers an increased riskfortype2 diabetes in affected women as early as adolescence. First-degree relatives (FDRs) of affected women are at increased risk for associated reproductive and metabolic phenotypes., Objective: We sought to prospectively assess insulin sensitivity and secretion and to measure reproductive hormone levels using sensitive techniques., Design, Setting, and Participants: Twelve premenarchal FDR girls and 10 control girls of comparable age, Tanner stage, and body mass index were studied at an academic medical center., Interventions: Frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests and oral glucose tolerance tests were performed., Main Outcome Measures: Reproductive hormone levels, lipid profiles, glucose tolerance, and frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance test parameters of insulin sensitivity and secretion were investigated., Results: Disposition index (DI), insulin secretion corrected for insulin sensitivity, was decreased in FDR compared with control girls at baseline (P =.01), independent of dysglycemia. Decreases in DI persisted in FDR girls during the 2-year follow-up (P =.003). T levels were increased (P =.02) in FDR compared with control girls at baseline, but this difference did not persist because T levels increased in control girls., Conclusions: DI is decreased in peripubertal FDR girls, and this decrease persists as puberty progresses. These findings suggest that beta-cell dysfunction is an early defect in glucose homeostasis preceding decompensation in glucose tolerance in FDR girls. T levels were increased in FDR girls earlier than previously reported, but these changes did not persist, suggesting an earlier onset of pubertal increases in glandular androgen secretion in FDR girls.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders in women. The data on this syndrome in a Chinese community are limited. Method(s): A community-based cross-sectional survey was undertaken. Cluster-randomized sampling was used. Female residents of Chengdu aged between 12 and 44 were included according to the constituent ratio of the female population of Sichuan province. We used three diagnostic criteria to determine the prevalence: the National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria of PCOS (NIH-1990), the revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria of PCOS (Rott-2003), and the recommended diagnostic criteria of PCOS by the Androgen Excess Society (AES-2006). Result(s): 1,645 participants were included. The prevalence of PCOS in women aged between 12 and 44 was 7.1, 11.2 and 7.4%, respectively, according to the three different criteria. After the onset of puberty, the prevalence of PCOS increased rapidly from 12 to 14 years of age, peaked between 15 and 24 and decreased gradually thereafter and reached its lowest point before menopause. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of PCOS in this study was in the PCOS prevalence range from existing studies. According to the trend of prevalence, PCOS might be a temporary condition. © 2014 S.

N2  - Objective To determine whether liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) determination of total (TT) and free (FT) testosterone is more specific than extraction chromatography-radioimmunoassay (RIA) for distinguishing women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) from controls and whether differing cutoff values should be used depending on the setting. Design Prospective case-control cohort study. Setting Tertiary care center and reference laboratory. Intervention(s) Blood sampling. Patient(s) One hundred patients with PCOS and 100 controls. Main Outcome Measure(s) Circulating TT measured by RIA and LC-MS/MS and FT measured by equilibrium dialysis using RIA or LC-MS/MS-generated TT values. Result(s) T measurement by RIA and LC-MS/MS similarly differentiated patients with PCOS from controls; detection of PCOS was higher for FT for both methods. TT values demonstrated greater overlap between patients with PCOS and controls than did FT for both RIA (80% vs. 42% overlap) and LC-MS/MS (52% vs. 67% overlap). A lower cutoff value by LC-MS/MS was better suited for the study of patients seen in the clinical (referred) setting (35 and 4.0 ng/dL for TT and FT, respectively) than in the screening of a general population (50 and 5.0 ng/dL for TT and FT, respectively). Conclusion(s) Extraction chromatography-RIA and LC-MS/MS measurements of T have similar performance for differentiating patients with PCOS from healthy controls; LC-MS/MS may be preferable given its relative ease of automation. Compared with FT, measurement of TT has relatively limited value for distinguishing PCOS from normal. Finally, different cutoff values should be considered depending on the clinical/investigative setting, with higher values being used in the study of biased (e.g., clinical or referred) populations. © 2014 American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective To describe the prevalence of androgenic alopecia (AGA) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to characterize associated clinical and biochemical features. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Multidisciplinary PCOS clinic at a tertiary academic center. Patient(s) A total of 254 women with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria were systematically examined from 2007 to 2012 by a reproductive endocrinologist, a dermatologist, and a psychologist. Intervention(s) Comprehensive dermatologic exams, ultrasonic imaging, serum testing, and Beck Depression Inventory Fast Screen (BDI-FS). Main Outcome Measures Presence of AGA, acne, hirsutism, biochemical hyperandrogenemia, metabolic dysfunction, and clinical depression. Result(s) Fifty-six of 254 patients with PCOS (22.0%) had AGA. Subjects with PCOS and AGA were more likely to have acne or hirsutism than those without AGA (96.3% vs. 70.6%). Subjects with AGA were more likely to report concern with hair loss (70.4% vs. 37.7%); however, their BDI-FS scores were no different from subjects without AGA. There were no differences between subjects with and without AGA in biochemical hyperandrogenism or metabolic parameters. Conclusion(s) AGA is prevalent in 22% of subjects meeting diagnostic criteria for PCOS. AGA is associated with other manifestations of clinical hyperandrogenism, but not with greater risk of biochemical hyperandrogenemia or metabolic dysfunction than with PCOS alone. © 2014 American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Published by Elsevier Inc.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition affecting ~8% of women. The objective of the present study was to quantify separately the risk of endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer in women with PCOS compared with non-PCOS controls, and quantify separately the risk to women of all ages as well as the risk to premenopausal women. Method(s): We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they compared women with PCOS to non-PCOS groups for fatal or non-fatal gynaecological cancers. Studies listed in MEDLINE and EMBASE published up to 7 October 2013 in any languagewere identified, and relevant papers were also searched by hand. Relevant data (for example, study design, source of control data, diagnostic criteria) were extracted and tabulated. Result(s): From698 references, 11 studies (5of endometrial cancer and 3 each of ovarian andbreast cancer) met the inclusion criteria for themetaanalysis (919 women with PCOS and 72054 non-PCOS controls). Using the Mantel-Haenszel method, with fixed or random effects model as appropriate, women with PCOS were at a significantly increased risk of endometrial cancer (odds ratio (OR), 2.79; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.31-5.95, P < 0.008), but the risk of ovarian and breast cancers was not significantly increased (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.93-2.15, P < 0.11 and OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.64-1.39, P < 0.78, respectively).Howeverwhen studies which includedwomen aged over 54 yearswere excluded fromthe analysis, the risk forwomenwith PCOS increased further for endometrial cancer (OR, 4.05; 95% CI, 2.42-6.76, P < 0.00001), became significantly increased for ovarian cancer (OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.08-5.89, P < 0.03), but remained non-significant for breast cancer (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.46-1.32, P < 0.35). Conclusion(s): This is the firstmeta-analysis to examine gynaecological cancers in women with PCOS younger than 54 years of age compared with controls of similar age.Current data suggest thatwomen of all ageswith PCOS are at an increased riskof endometrial cancer but the riskofovarian and breast cancerwas not significantly increased overall. These results highlight the potential risk of gynaecological cancer morbidities associatedwith PCOS.However, the available evidence is far fromrobust and variationin diagnostic criteria forPCOS, associated risk factors (particularly obesity), and selection bias in the studies may have resulted in an exaggeration of the increased risk. Furthermore, women who have PCOS should also be made aware that any increased risk for endometrial cancermust be judged in the context of its relatively lowincidence in the general population.Alargewellcontrolled prospective study is required in order to gain a more accurate estimate of the risk of gynaecological cancers in women with PCOS. © The Author 2014.

N2  - Purpose: This study aimed to assess the effect of hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) detection on the diagnostic screening for glucose metabolic disorders in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 161 patients with PCOS (mean age = 23.68 +/- 4.23 years) were subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and HbA1C was used to probe the sensitivity and specificity of abnormal glucose tolerance. Result(s): Based on the traditional standards of blood sugar, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 5.6%, and the pre-diabetes prevalence was 7.5%. Based on the HbA1C standards, 4.3% of patients were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and 10.6% of the diabetic patients can be considered as high-risk populations. Based on the combined standards of OGTT and HbA1C, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 6.2%, and the pre-diabetes prevalence was 12.4%. OGTT is considered the gold standard for identifying abnormal glucose tolerance, and HbA1C detection is considered to be stronger than FPG. The areas under the ROC curves of HbA1C and FPG were 0.968 and 0.672, respectively (p < 0.01). The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends the cut-off value of HbA1c >= 5.7% and FPG >=.6 mmol/l for identifying abnormal glucose tolerance. The sensitivity and specificity were 76.7% and 89.5% for HBA1C, as well as 40.5% and 94.3% for FPG, respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 7.3 and 0.26 for HbA1C, as well as 7.1 and 0.63 for FPG, respectively. Conclusion(s): HbA1C detection can be used as a method for diagnosis and screening.

N2  - Objective-To study the independent associations of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and its 2 components, hyperandrogenism and anovulation, with coronary artery calcification (CAC) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT)., Approach and Results-At the year 20 of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a population-based multicenter cohort of young adults, women (mean age, 45 years) with information on menses and hirsutism in their twenties were assessed for CAC (n=982) and IMT (n=988). We defined PCOS as women who had both irregular menses and hyperandrogenism (n=55); isolated oligomenorrhea (n=103) as women who only had irregular menses; and isolated hyperandrogenism (n=156) as women who had either hirsutism or increased testosterone levels. Logistic regressions and general linear models were used to estimate the associations between components of PCOS and subclinical CVD. The prevalence of CAC was 10.3% overall. Women with PCOS had a multivariable adjusted odds ratio of 2.70 (95% confidence interval, 1.31-5.60) for CAC. Women with either isolated oligomenorrhea or isolated hyperandrogenism had no increased risk of CAC when compared with unexposed women. Women with PCOS had significantly increased bulb and internal carotid-IMT measurements; however, no significant differences were noted in bulb or internal carotid artery IMT among women with either isolated oligomenorrhea or isolated hyperandrogenism when compared with unexposed women. There were no differences in common carotid-IMT among the 4 study groups., Conclusions-In this study, women with PCOS, manifested as both anovulation and hyperandrogenism, but not women with one of these manifestations alone, were at increased risk for the development of subclinical CVD.Copyright © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.

N2  - Objective To investigate whether retesting with the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is useful and necessary for all women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design Follow-up study. Setting Tertiary medical center. Patient(s) Eighty-four women with PCOS and 45 healthy controls. Intervention(s) Peripheral venous blood sampling. Main Outcome Measure(s) We performed a 75-g 2-hour OGTT in women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) at the time of the first test with and without PCOS. Result(s) The average follow-up period for women with PCOS was 2.6 years (range, 2-4.17 years). Seventy-eight of these women had NGT at baseline, 11.5% converted to IGT, with an annualized incidence rate of 4.5%. Of those women with IGT at baseline (n = 6), 33.3% converted to type 2 diabetes mellitus, with an annualized incidence rate of 10.4%. In the healthy subjects, the average follow-up period was 2.6 years (range, 2-4.08 years). Forty-two of these women had NGT at baseline, 2.3% converted to IGT, giving a progression of 0.9% per year. Among the three women with IGT at baseline, 33.3% reverted to NGT, and 66.6% had persistent IGT. Conclusion(s) Conversion rates from NGT to IGT or type 2 diabetes mellitus were accelerated in women with PCOS compared with healthy subjects. Women with PCOS should be tested regularly for early detection of abnormal glucose tolerance. In addition, the interval for periodic rescreening should be determined by further studies involving more women with PCOS.

N2  - Objective To compare the diagnostic potential of ultrasonographic markers of ovarian morphology, used alone or in combination, to predict polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design A diagnostic test study using cross-sectional data collected from 2006-2011. Setting Academic hospital and clinical research unit. Patient(s) Eighty-two women with PCOS and 60 healthy female volunteers. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Follicle number per ovary (FNPO), ovarian volume (OV), follicle number per single cross-section (FNPS), follicle distribution pattern, stromal area, ovarian area, stromal-to-ovarian area ratio (S:A), and stromal index (SI). Result(s) Follicle number per ovary best predicted PCOS (R2 = 67%) with 85% sensitivity and 98% specificity, followed by OV (R2 = 44%), and FNPS (R2 = 36%). Neither S:A nor SI had predictive power for PCOS. In combination, FNPO+S:A and FNPO+SI most significantly predicted PCOS (R2 = 74% vs. 73%, respectively). The diagnostic potentials of OV and FNPS were substantially improved when used in combination (OV+FNPO, R2 = 55%). Conclusion(s) As a single metric, FNPO best predicted PCOS. Although the addition of S:A or SI improved the predictive power of FNPO, gains were marginal, suggesting limited use in clinical practice. When image quality precludes a reliable estimation of FNPO, measurements of OV+FNPS provide the next closest level of diagnostic potential. © 2014 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Context: Although there is evidence of metabolic risks in young women with irregular menses and androgen excess, persistence of risks after menopause is unclear. Objective(s): The objective of the study was to determine the impact of menopause on the cardiometabolic profile in women with high androgens and a history of menstrual irregularity. Method(s): Study of Women's Health Across the Nation is a longitudinal cohort study. Data from 1929womenwithout metabolic syndrome (MetS) at baseline were analyzed for incidence of MetS, self-reported stroke, and myocardial infarction. Cox hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated, adjusting for age, ethnicity, body mass, smoking, menopausal status, and study site. Result(s): Among MetS-free women at baseline, 497 new cases were identified during 20 249 woman- years of follow-up over 12 years. Women with hyperandrogenemia (HA) and oligomenorrhea (Oligo) developed incident cases of MetS at a comparable rate compared with their counterparts: eumenorrheic, normoandrogenic women [HR 1.4 (0.9 -2.2)], oligomenorrheic, normoandrogenic women [HR 1.3 (0.8 -2.2)], and eumenorrheic hyperandrogenic women [HR 1.2 (0.7-1.8)]. Smoking and obesity were the strongest predictors of incident MetS. There was no significant difference in incidence of self-reported stroke or MI by HA/Oligo status. Conclusion(s): Longitudinal evidence suggests that a history of androgen excess and menstrual irregularity is not associated with worsening of metabolic health after menopause. Our findings challenge the notion that a history of concurrent HA and Oligo reflects ongoing cardiometabolic risk in postmenopausal women. © 2014 by the Endocrine Society.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders in women. The data on this syndrome in a Chinese community are limited. Method(s): A community-based cross-sectional survey was undertaken. Cluster-randomized sampling was used. Female residents of Chengdu aged between 12 and 44 were included according to the constituent ratio of the female population of Sichuan province. We used three diagnostic criteria to determine the prevalence: the National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria of PCOS (NIH-1990), the revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria of PCOS (Rott-2003), and the recommended diagnostic criteria of PCOS by the Androgen Excess Society (AES-2006). Result(s): 1,645 participants were included. The prevalence of PCOS in women aged between 12 and 44 was 7.1, 11.2 and 7.4%, respectively, according to the three different criteria. After the onset of puberty, the prevalence of PCOS increased rapidly from 12 to 14 years of age, peaked between 15 and 24 and decreased gradually thereafter and reached its lowest point before menopause. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of PCOS in this study was in the PCOS prevalence range from existing studies. According to the trend of prevalence, PCOS might be a temporary condition.Copyright © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is linked with metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and endocrine function in patients with PCOS. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of adolescent PCOS and characteristics associated with PCOS in adolescents in Babol, Iran. Material(s) and Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1549 girl high school students aged 16-20 years who were living in Iran. After overnight fasting, blood samples were collected to determine hormones and lipid levels in PCOS patients between the first and fifth days of their menstrual period or withdrawal bleeding. Result(s): The overall prevalence of adolescent PCOS was 129 (8.3%) (95% CI; 4.0, 12.0). Irregular menstruation was observed in 24.1% of adolescents. A total of 68% of PCOS adolescents had insulin resistance. Compared with non-PCOS adolescents, the OR of adolescent PCOS for family history of hirsutism was 1.53 (95% CI, 1.06-2.20; p=0.024), family history of irregular menstrual cycle was 2.27 (95% CI, 1.56-3.30; p<0.001), menarche age <13 years was 1.95 (95% CI, 1.36-2.81; p<0.001), hirsutism was 1.14 (CI 95%, 1.10-1.17; p<0.001), acne was 5.10 (CI 95%, 3.52-7.40; p<0.001), and wrist circumference was 1.28 (CI 95%, 1.07-1.54; p=0.007). Conclusion(s): The presenting findings showed the high prevalence of PCOS among Iranian adolescents. Emphasis should be placed on clinical screening in adolescents with high-risk factors, including irregular menstrual, menarche <13 years, hirsutism, acne, high wrist circumference, and paternal obesity to help reduce the risk of developing metabolic disturbance and to find ways to improve long-term health.Copyright © 2014, WDG.

N2  - Objective: To determine the incidence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) among Han women of reproductive age in Liaoning Province in Northeastern China, based on the Revised Rotterdam 2003 criteria. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective cohort study was carried out on 1,600 women using questionnaires, physical examination, ultrasonography, and biochemical indices (aged = 19 to 45 years; n = 1,600). PCOS patients were identified using the Revised Rotterdam 2003 criteria. Result(s): A total of 132 Han women of reproductive age were diagnosed with PCOS, with a prevalence of 8.25%. The prevalence of menstrual dysfunction was as follows: 97 patients (73.48%) had abnormal menstruation, three (2.27%) had polymenorrhea, and 94 (71.21%) had oligomenorrhea. Up to 64 patients (48.48%) had androgen excess, 42 (31.82%) had biochemical evidence of androgen excess, and 34 (25.76%) had clinical androgen excess. Up to 34 patients (25.76%) were obese (body mass index [BMI] >= 25) and 19 (14.39%) had hirsutism (F-G scoring >= 6). A total of 127 patients (96.22%) were diagnosed with PCOS via ultrasonography, 67 of whom (50.76%) had a unilateral polycystic ovary and 60 (45.46%) had bilateral polycystic ovaries. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of PCOS in this study population was 8.25%, with an infertility rate of 27.8%. The classical manifestation of PCOS is PCO, abnormal menstruation, and obesity. The high-risk factors of PCOS include high free testosterone index, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), increased serum testosterone and androstenedione, decreased sex hormone-binding globulin, long history of infertility, menarche later than 16 years old, and failure to have regular menstruation within two years.

N2  - STUDY QUESTIONWhat is the prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in Han Chinese women from different communities?SUMMARY ANSWERThe prevalence of PCOS in Chinese women aged 19-45 years is 5.6%.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYThe prevalence of PCOS is reported to range from 5 to 10% but to the best of our knowledge the Han Chinese population has not been studied.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONA large-scale epidemiological study was carried out between October 2007 and September 2011 in 15 924 Han Chinese women of reproductive age (19-45 years) from the 10 provinces and municipalities in China.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSA total of 16 886 women from 152 cities and 112 villages were involved in the study. All study participants received a questionnaire and underwent a physical and transvaginal ultrasound examination. Blood samples were collected from a subsample of women (n = 3565) for analysis of metabolic markers and hormones. Based on the Rotterdam PCOS criteria, we assessed hyperandrogenism (H), chronic anovulation (O) and polycystic ovaries (P). Following diagnosis, women with PCOS were assigned to one of four different phenotypes. Finally, the prevalence and related risks of PCOS among Chinese women were estimated based on all the data sources.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEA total of 16 886 women were initially involved in the study and 15 924 eligible participants then completed the study; the overall response rate was 94.3% (15 924/16 886). The prevalence of PCOS in the Chinese community population was 5.6% (894/15 924). Blood samples were analyzed from 833 of these women who were assigned to the four PCOS phenotypes as follows: 19% H + O, 37% H + P, 15% O + P and 29% H + O + P. Comparing the 833 women with PCOS to 2732 women without PCOS indicated that PCOS occurs in younger women (P < 0.05) and these women were prone not only to menstrual problems, hyperandrogenism, PCO and infertility but also metabolic syndrome (MS) and insulin resistance (IR). However, there was no significant difference in the rate of hypertension or hyperlipemia between the two groups. Obese patients with PCOS had a higher rate of MS (16 versus 48%), IR (7 versus 28%), hypertension (8 versus 30%) and hyperlipemia (48 versus 73%) compared with non-obese patients (all P < 0.05), respectively. The rates of metabolic complications in patients with PCOS increased with age.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONAge and ethnic origin contribute to the differing manifestations of PCOS; therefore, sampling is one of the most important issues in epidemiological research into PCOS. Owing to the mobility of the Chinese population, the survey among resident populations caused a certain deviation in the age distribution.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSThe prevention and treatment of PCOS, particularly in those who are obese, are essential in Chinese women of reproductive age. © The Author 2013.

N2  - STUDY QUESTIONAre HbA1c and fasting glucose (FG) useful in predicting the presence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in a large cohort of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?SUMMARY ANSWERHbA1c and FG are not suitable as screening tools for prediabetes in a large cohort of PCOS women but do show a good level of agreement with T2DM.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYWomen with PCOS have an increased risk of prediabetes and T2DM. As performing an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is time consuming, HbA1c and FG have been suggested as screening tools for prediabetes and T2DM.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONThis was a cross-sectional study of 671 women with PCOS conducted from 2006 to 2012.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSThe study was carried out at the endocrinological outpatient department of the Medical University of Graz, Austria. We performed 75 g 2-h OGTTs and measured HbA1c in 671 women with PCOS aged 16-45 years with a median BMI of 24.2 (21.3-30.1) kg/m2. PCOS was defined according to the Rotterdam criteria. Prediabetes (FG 100-125 mg/dl and/or 2-h glucose 140-199 mg/dl and/or HbA1c 5.7-6.4%) and T2DM (FG >= 126 mg/dl and/or 2-h glucose >=200 mg/dl and/or HbA1c >= 6.5%) were diagnosed according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. Levels of agreement between different definitions were analyzed using kappa-index.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEAccording to the ADA criteria, we found prediabetes and T2DM in 12.8% (n = 76) and 1.5% (n = 9) of PCOS women, respectively. When using elevated HbA1c (5.7-6.4%) for defining prediabetes, 19 (3.2%) of all PCOS women had prediabetes with a kappa-index of 0.36. When using elevated FG (100-125 mg/dl) for defining prediabetes, 31 (5.2%) of all the PCOS women were diagnosed with prediabetes with a kappa-index of 0.05. Further, elevated HbA1c (>=6.5% defining T2DM) was found in six (0.9%) PCOS women (kappa-index 0.80), and elevated FG (>=126 mg/dl diagnosing T2DM) was found in seven PCOS women (1%; kappa-index 0.82).LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONOur results are limited to an Austrian cohort of PCOS women diagnosed by Rotterdam criteria with a median BMI in the normal weight range.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSOur results are in line with results from previous smaller PCOS cohorts. Our findings do not support the recommendation that FG or HbA1c can be used for the screening of prediabetes in women with PCOS. For such women, OGTT should be performed for screening of prediabetes. Whether this finding is generalizable to other cohorts remains to be determined in further studies. © The Author 2013.

N2  - Study Questio: NDo the ultrasonographic criteria for polycystic ovaries supported by the 2003 Rotterdam consensus adequately discriminate between the normal and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) condition in light of recent advancements in imaging technology and reliable methods for estimating follicle populations in PCOS?STUDY ANSWERUsing newer ultrasound technology and a reliable grid system approach to count follicles, we concluded that a substantially higher threshold of follicle counts throughout the entire ovary (FNPO)-26 versus 12 follicles-is required to distinguish among women with PCOS and healthy women from the general population. What Is Known Already: The Rotterdam consensus defined the polycystic ovary as having 12 or more follicles, measuring between 2 and 9 mm (FNPO), and/or an ovarian volume (OV) >10 cm3. Since their initial proposal in 2003, a heightened prevalence of polycystic ovaries has been described in healthy women with regular menstrual cycles, which has questioned the accuracy of these criteria and marginalized the specificity of polycystic ovaries as a diagnostic criterion for PCOS.STUDY Design: , SIZE, DURATIONA diagnostic test study was performed using cross-sectional data, collected from 2006 to 2011, from 168 women prospectively evaluated by transvaginal ultrasonography. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to determine the appropriate diagnostic thresholds for: (i) FNPO, (ii) follicle counts in a single cross section (FNPS) and (iii) OV. The levels of intra-and inter-observer reliability when five observers used the proposed criteria on 100 ultrasound cases were also determined. Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods: Ninety-eight women diagnosed with PCOS by the National Institutes of Health criteria as having both oligo-amenorrhea and hyperandrogenism and 70 healthy female volunteers recruited from the general population. Participants were evaluated by transvaginal ultrasonography at the Royal University Hospital within the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of Saskatchewan (Saskatoon, SK, Canada) and in the Division of Nutritional Sciences' Human Metabolic Research Unit, Cornell University (Ithaca, NY, USA).MAIN RESULTSDiagnostic potential for PCOS was highest for FNPO (0.969), followed by FNPS (0.880) and OV (0.873) as judged by the area under the ROC curve. An FNPO threshold of 26 follicles had the best compromise between sensitivity (85%) and specificity (94%) when discriminating between controls and PCOS. Similarly, an FNPS threshold of nine follicles had a 69% sensitivity and 90% specificity, and an OV of 10 cm3 had a 81% sensitivity and 84% specificity. Levels of intra-observer reliability were 0.81, 0.80 and 0.86 when assessing FNPO, FNPS and OV, respectively. Inter-observer reliability was 0.71, 0.72 and 0.82, respectively. Limitations, Reasons for Caution Thresholds proposed by this study should be limited to use in women aged between 18 and 35 years. Wider Implications of the Findings: Polycystic ovarian morphology has excellent diagnostic potential for detecting PCOS. FNPO have better diagnostic potential and yield greater diagnostic confidence compared with assessments of FNPS or OV. Whenever possible, images throughout the entire ovary should be collected for the ultrasonographic evaluation of PCOS.

N2  - Objective Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are potentially at increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) diseases due to well-established risk factors, including insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, data showing excess CV events in this population are still lacking. We investigated the incidence and prevalence of CV events in a cohort of women with PCOS. Design Retrospective cohort study (total follow-up >12 000 person-years). Setting Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland (Total Female population of 434 859), UK. Participants Two thousand three hundred and one women with PCOS (mean age = 29.6 years) attending a speciality clinic in Leicestershire, UK. Main outcomes measures T2DM, myocardial infarction (MI), angina, heart failure (HF), stroke and CV-related death. Results Incidence of T2DM, MI, angina, HF, stroke and CV death was respectively 3.6, 0.8, 1.0, 0.3, 0.0 and 0.4 per 1000 person-years. At the end of follow-up, the prevalence of MI in the age groups 45-54, 55-64 and >65 years was 1.9%, 6.0% and 27.3% and of angina was 2.6%, 6.0% and 27.3%, respectively. Age-group-specific odds ratios for the prevalence of MI and angina compared to the local female population ranged between 2.6 (95% CI: 1.0-6.3) and 12.9 (CI: 3.4-48.6) with the highest ratio being for MI in the group >65 years old. Age, history of hypertension and smoking had significant correlations with CV outcomes in the PCOS patients. Conclusion We have shown a high incidence and age-group-specific prevalence of T2DM, MI and angina in the women with PCOS, with over a quarter having had MI or angina in those >65 years. These findings should be considered in the treatment strategies and long-term planning for women with PCOS. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Objective To evaluate the role of mean ovarian volume (MOV) in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) during adolescence, and its relationship with metabolic and endocrine parameters. Design Observational study. Patients A total of 134 young girls, including 86 adolescents with PCOS and 48 controls, were studied. Measurements During the early follicular phase, a pelvic ultrasound examination was performed to measure the ovarian volume of both ovaries and to calculate the MOV. All subjects underwent hormonal assessment and an ultrasound examination. PCOS subjects were submitted to an oral glucose tolerance test. The homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and several insulin resistance indexes were also determined. Results Androgens, free androgen index (FAI), LH and insulin resistance indexes were higher in the PCOS group. MOV was significantly different between the two groups: control group 4.6 +/- 1.9 cm3, adolescent PCOS group 9.6 +/- 4.4 cm 3. The MOV threshold of 5.596 cm3 offered the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity based on the characteristics of the operating receiver curve analysis. Therefore, an ovarian volume higher than 5.6 increased the risk of PCOS by about 15 times (OR 16.25 IC 95% 6.3-41.3). In adolescent PCOS girls, the ovarian volume was significantly associated with circulating testosterone and insulin, and indices of insulin resistance. Conclusions During early adolescence MOV evaluation may offer an effective means to screen and follow up young girls with irregular cycles in order to prevent the long-term metabolic disturbances of the polycystic ovary syndrome. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Objective: Hirsutism is frequently present in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and is a major sign of hyperandrogenism. However, other disorders frequently present in PCOS, particularly abdominal obesity and insulin resistance (IR), have also been implicated in the development of hirsutism in this population but relevant data are limited. We aimed to define the determinants of the presence of hirsutism in PCOS. Design(s): Observational study. Method(s): We studied 1297 patients with PCOS (age 24.3+/-5.8 years, BMI 26.8+/-6.9 kg/m2). Hirsutism was defined as a modified Ferriman-Gallwey score >=8. Result(s): Women with hirsutism were younger, had greater BMI, and had higher levels of circulating androgens than women without hirsutism; markers of IR did not differ between the two groups after adjustment for age and BMI. The prevalence of hirsutism progressively declined with age, was lower in normal-weight women than in overweight and obese women, and was comparably prevalent in the hyperandrogenemic phenotypes of PCOS. In binary logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of the presence of hirsutism were younger age, larger waist circumference (W), and higher serum testosterone levels. In stepwise linear regression analysis, the Ferriman-Gallwey score independently correlated with age, W, free androgen index, and serum DELTA4-androstenedione and DHEAS levels. Conclusion(s): Besides hyperandrogenemia, abdominal obesity, and young age are independently associated with the presence of hirsutism. In contrast, the relationship between IR and hirsutism appears to be mediated by the more severe obesity of insulin-resistant patients with PCOS. © 2013 European Society of Endocrinology.

N2  - Context: Most of the estimates of the prevalence of hyperandrogenic states refer to the general adult population. Objective(s): The objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence of hyperandrogenic states in late adolescence and youth and to evaluate potential independent predictors. Design(s): This was a cross-sectional study. Setting(s): The study was conducted in high schools. Patient(s): Patients included female students, aged 16-19 years. Main Outcome Measure(s): The study protocol was designed with 3 possible levels of participation: the first level consisted of a self-compiled questionnaire; the second level added a medical examination; and the third level added a blood sample for laboratory testing. Liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry was used to measure total testosterone, and a reference interval was established in-house. Result(s): We offered participation to 2052 students, and 1469 of those compiled the questionnaire. Of these, 1038 were examined, and 519 also provided blood samples. Two hundred three of the 1038 examined students and 125 of the 519 students who provided blood samples were subsequently excluded because of treatment with oral contraceptives or because of endocrine disorders. In the sample of women with a questionnaire + a medical examination, 13% were affected by isolated menstrual irregularity, 16.1% by isolated clinical hyperandrogenism, and 3.8% by both states. A similar prevalence of isolated menstrual irregularity (10.2%) and isolated clinical hyperandrogenism (16.7%) was found in the subsample of women with laboratory tests; in addition, 6.6% showed isolated hyperandrogenemia, and 4.3% proved to be affected by polycystic ovary syndrome. Conclusion(s): This study provides for the first time a reliable assessment of the prevalence of hyperandrogenic states in late adolescent and young females and confirms that hyperandrogenic disorders originate at a young age.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents and its association with obesity. Design(s): Cross-sectional study using electronic medical records. Setting(s): Not applicable. Patient(s): Adolescents aged 15-19 years (n = 137,502). Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): PCOS diagnosed or defined according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria. Result(s): The prevalence of a confirmed diagnosis of PCOS was 0.56%, which increased to 1.14% when undiagnosed cases with documented symptoms qualifying for PCOS according to NIH criteria were included. Compared with normal/underweight girls, the odds ratios (OR and 95% confidence interval [CI]) for confirmed PCOS diagnosis were 3.85 (3.04-4.88), 10.25 (8.16-12.84), and 23.10 (18.66-28.61) for overweight, moderately obese, and extremely obese adolescents, respectively, after adjusting for potential confounders. When adolescents with two or more supportive diagnoses were included (diagnosed and undiagnosed PCOS-NIH), the ORs (95% CI) for PCOS-NIH by weight class were significantly attenuated to 2.95 (2.53-3.44), 6.73 (5.78-7.83), and 14.65 (12.73-16.86) for overweight, moderately obese, and extremely obese adolescents, respectively. Conclusion(s): Overweight and obesity were associated with higher odds of PCOS in adolescents. Studies based solely on diagnosis codes may underestimate the prevalence of PCOS and overestimate the magnitude of the association between obesity and PCOS.

N2  - Objective: To study the association between birth weight and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adult life in Danish women born 1973-1991. Design(s): Register study. Setting(s): Data were extracted from the Danish Medical Birth Register and the Danish National Patient Register (NPR). Patient(s): All female children born of Danish mothers in Denmark between 1973 and 1991 were included (n = 523,757) and followed for a total of 4,739,547 person-years at risk. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Information on birth weight was extracted from the Danish Medical Birth Register. The cohort was followed up in the NPR for PCOS diagnoses from age 15 years until the end of 2006. Furthermore, information on maternal diabetes diagnoses was extracted from the NPR. Result(s): The risk of PCOS was significantly increased in women with birth weight >=4,500 g (incidence rate ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval 1.21-2.03) compared to women with birth weight 3,000-3,499 g. All women with birth weight >=4,500 g were born large for gestational age and a birth weight of 4,500 g represented the 98.5th percentile of the birth weights. Women born of mothers diagnosed with diabetes were at increased risk of PCOS. In these women the risk of PCOS increased with decreasing birth weight. Conclusion(s): The risk of PCOS was increased in women born with birth weight >=4,500 g. In women of diabetic mothers we found an increased risk of PCOS, which was inversely related to birth weight. ©2013 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Background: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common gynecological endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age. Despite its heavy burden on female reproduction and general health, there is no study regarding PCOS prevalence in Palestine. This study aims to establish prevalence of PCOS among female university students at An-Najah National University-Palestine and to explore its possible risk factors. Method(s): A cross sectional study was conducted on 137 female students using convenience sampling method for age group (18-24) years. PCOS cases were identified according to the National Institute of health (NIH) criteria through clinical interview and assessment for participants at the University clinics. Menstrual irregularities regarding cycle and flow were identified and clinical hyperandrogenism was assessed as the self-reported degree of hirsutism using the modified Ferriman Gallwey (mF-G) scoring method of more than 8 score. Biochemical hyperandrogenism for girls with menstrual irregularities was assessed by measuring free testosterone level. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 17 applying descriptive methods; different risk factor relationships were estimated using bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. Result(s): The estimated prevalence of PCOS was 7.3%, acne was the only studied risk factor among others to be statistically significantly related to PCOS patients (OR = 8.430, P-value = 0.015). Clinical Hirsutism was found in 27% of participants, 70% of whom had idiopathic hirsutism. Conclusion(s): Prevalence of PCOS in Palestine seems to be relatively high but similar to other Mediterranean statistics. We recommend further studies using wider age group and larger sample for all parts of Palestine in order to generalize results. © 2013 Musmar et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate in a cross-sectional study adiponectin and leptin levels in prepubertal and pubertal daughters of women with PCOS and their relationship to insulin sensitivity and reproductive features. Study design: We studied 92 daughters of PCOS women (PCOSd) and 76 daughters of control women (Cd) matched by age and body mass index SD scores and distributed according to breast Tanner stage: prepuberty (Tanner 1), early puberty (Tanner 2-3) or late puberty (Tanner 4-5). In all girls an oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Leptin, adiponectin, sex steroids, SHBG, glucose, insulin and lipid profile were determined. Leptin-adiponectin ratio, free androgen index and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR and ISI composite) were then calculated. Result(s): Prepubertal PCOSd showed lower serum adiponectin compared to Cd (p = 0.028), whereas during puberty no differences were observed between the groups. Leptin concentrations were similar in both groups in all Tanner stages. In addition, in PCOSd during early puberty, adiponectin showed a negative correlation with testosterone and leptin showed a negative correlation with ISI composite, which were independent of BMI SDS (r = -0.39; p = 0.02 and r = -0.42; p = 0.01). Conclusion(s): These observations suggest that during the prepubertal period PCOSd exhibit abnormal adiponectin levels, independently of BMI. Moreover, leptin and adiponectin may be related to metabolic and reproductive abnormalities observed in PCOSd during the early stages of sexual development. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - STUDY QUESTIONWhat is the prevalence, phenotype and metabolic features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in the same population according to three different diagnostic criteria? SUMMARY ANSWERThe prevalence of PCOS under National Institutes of Health (NIH), Rotterdam and Androgen Excess and PCOS (AE-PCOS) Society criteria was 6.1, 19.9 and 15.3, respectively. PCOS carried a 2-fold increased risk of metabolic syndrome regardless of the diagnostic criteria used. WHAT IS KNOWN AND WHAT THIS PAPER ADDSThe prevalence rates of PCOS differ depending on the diagnostic criteria used to define the syndrome. The current paper gives the prevalence rates of the component and composite phenotypes of PCOS in the same population and reports similar rates of metabolic syndrome in women with PCOS under contrasting diagnostic criteria. DESIGNIn this cross-sectional study, 392 women between the ages of 18 and 45 years were analyzed. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGWhen the prevalence of PCOS according to NIH was set to 8 with a precision of 2.2 and confidence interval of 95, the sample size required for a prevalence survey was found to be 400 subjects. The study was carried out in the General Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration, a government-based institute, in which the largest number of female staff (n=527) are employed within a single institute in Ankara, Turkey. The study was performed between 7 December 2009 and 30 April 2010. All female subjects between the ages of 18 and 45 years were invited to participate. Women older than 45 or younger than 18 years, post-menopausal women, women with a history of hysterectomy or bilateral oopherectomy and pregnant women were excluded. Totally, 392 of the employees were recruited for the final analyses. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEThe prevalence of PCOS under NIH, Rotterdam and AE-PCOS Society criteria were 6.1, 19.9 and 15.3, respectively. While the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 6.1 in the whole study group, within the patients diagnosed as PCOS according to NIH, Rotterdam and AE-PCOS Society criteria, it was 12.5, 10.3 and 10.0, respectively. BIAS, CONFOUNDING AND OTHER REASONS FOR CAUTIONEven though we have included women working at a single institution with a high response rate for the participation, we cannot exclude potential selection bias due to undetermined differences between our sample and BACKGROUNDBACKGROUND community. We might have underestimated actual prevalence of metabolic syndrome in PCOS due to lack of oral glucose tolerance test 2 h glucose data. GENERALIZABILITY TO OTHER POPULATIONSCurrent results can be generalized to Caucasian populations and may present variations in other populations according to race and ethnicity.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background Given the current lack of clarity in the published literature, we performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the exact strength of the association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometrial cancer (EC). Methods All published studies on the association between PCOS and EC identified through MEDLINE (1966-April 2011), EMBASE (1980-April 2011) and Cochrane (1998-April 2011). Original data were abstracted where available and summarized on a separate Microsoft Excel (2007) database for analysis. A total of 14 studies comparative and non-comparative were identified and included. Results The non-comparative and comparative data suggested that women with PCOS were more likely to develop EC. A meta-analyses of five comparative studies showed an increased risk of EC in women with an odds ratio of 2.89 with a 95 confidence interval of 1.525.48. Conclusions Women with PCOS are about three times more likely to develop EC compared with women without it. This translates into a 9 lifetime risk of EC in Caucasian women with PCOS compared with 3 in women without it. Although most women (91) with PCOS will not develop endometrial cancer, our study has shown that they are more likely at increased risk. More studies are required to clarify the exact molecular mechanisms, determine the best way of screening and preventing disease progression. © 2012 The Autho.

N2  - Objectives: To explore the clinical and metabolic features exhibited by Chinese adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to determine the differences between nonobese and obese adolescent patients with PCOS. Design(s): Clinical cross-sectional study. Setting(s): Department of Gynecology and Reproductive Center. Participant(s): 25 obese and 66 nonobese adolescents with PCOS and 26 age-matched controls. Intervention(s): Fasting venous blood samples and an oral glucose tolerance test using 75 g of glucose were obtained from PCOS patients and controls. Main Outcome Measure(s): Clinical features were summarized. Serum levels of FSH, LH, E2, TT, SHBG, fasting insulin, and fasting glucose were measured. Result(s): The prevalence of obesity in adolescents with PCOS was 27% (25/91). 99% of these patients presented with menstrual disorders, 84% presented with clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and 90% exhibited an ultrasonographic appearance of polycystic ovaries. The prevalence of hirsutism and acanthosis nigricans were higher in the obese PCOS group than in the nonobese PCOS group (72% vs 41% and 44% vs 5%, respectively). A total of 5 of 20 obese (25%) and 5 of 36 nonobese patients (14%) demonstrated impaired glucose tolerance levels. Conclusion(s): Chinese adolescents with PCOS manifest clinical and metabolic features similar to those of adult Chinese women with PCOS except for the increased prevalence of hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. Adolescents with high risk factors, especially those with menstrual disorders and hyperandrogenism, may need careful clinical screening. © 2012 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and its phenotypes as defined by the National Institutes of Health, Rotterdam criteria, and Androgen Society. Study Design: Thomson Reuters MarketScan Commercial databases (Thomson Reuters Healthcare Inc, New York, NY) for 2003-2008 were used to calculate the prevalence of PCOS and to assess differences in demographic characteristics and comorbid conditions among women who were 18-45 years old with and without PCOS. Result(s): The prevalence of PCOS was 1585.1 per 100,000; women with phenotype A or classic PCOS were most prevalent at 1031.5 per 100,000. Women with PCOS were more likely than those without PCOS to be 25-34 years old, be from the South, be infertile, have metabolic syndrome, have been seen by an endocrinologist, and have taken oral contraceptives. Conclusion(s): This is the first study to use all available criteria to estimate the prevalence of PCOS. Providers should evaluate women with menstrual dysfunction for the presence of PCOS.

T1  - Polycystic ovary syndrome in Salvador, Brazil: A prevalence study in primary healthcare
A1  - Gabrielli L.
A1  - Aquino E.M.L. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition in women of reproductive age. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and polycystic ovaries. It is associated with obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. No studies have been conducted on the prevalence of PCOS in Brazilian or South American women. Few studies using the Rotterdam criteria have been published. The objective of the present study was to calculate the prevalence of PCOS at primary healthcare level in Salvador, Brazil based on these criteria. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional, two-phase study conducted in a probability sample of women of 18-45 years of age screened for cervical cancer in the primary healthcare network of the city of Salvador, Brazil. In the first phase, interviews were conducted, weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure and random blood sugar levels were measured, and the presence of acne and hirsutism was investigated. Women with at least one diagnostic criterion were referred for the second phase, which consisted of specialist consultation, pelvic ultrasonography and hormone measurements for differential diagnosis and/or investigation of a second criterion. Result(s): Of the 859 women interviewed, 88.5% were black and 58.7% had 11 years of schooling or less. A diagnosis of PCOS was excluded in 84.4%, undetermined in 7.1% and confirmed in 8.5% (95%CI: 6.80-10.56). There were no statistically significant differences between these three groups with respect to weight, body mass index, waist circumference, blood sugar levels or arterial blood pressure. Women with PCOS were younger (p = 0.00), taller (p = 0.04), had fewer children (p = 0.00), were better educated (p = 0.01), and had higher total testosterone levels (p = 0.01) and a higher LH/FSH ratio (p = 0.01). Conclusion(s): According to the Rotterdam criteria, the prevalence of PCOS in women seeking primary healthcare in Salvador, Brazil, was 8.5%. © 2012 Gabrielli and Aquino; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, and dyslipidemia, but the effects of these disturbances on long-term health are not fully understood. Aim(s): Our aim was to determine the relative risk of type 2 diabetes, cancer, large-vessel disease (LVD), and all-cause mortality for women diagnosed with PCOS. Design(s): Data were extracted from the General Practice Research Database, a longitudinal, anonymized research database derived from nearly 600 primary-care practices in the United Kingdom. Patients with a diagnosis of PCOS between 1990 and 2010 were selected. Patients were matched to two sets of controls. The first set was matched according to primary-care practice and age, and the second was also matched on body mass index. Primary outcome was first incident record of diabetes. Crude rates for diabetes were presented, and time to diabetes was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models. Secondary outcomes (cancer, LVD, and mortality) were also modeled. Result(s): Of 53,303 identified with a diagnosis of PCOS, 21,740 (40.8%) met the eligibility criteria. Median follow-up was 4.7 yr (interquartile range = 2.0-8.6 yr) in those with PCOS and 5.8 yr (2.7-9.6) in the reference group. Crude rates of diabetes were 5.7 and 1.7 per 1000 patient-years for cases and controls, respectively. The corresponding adjusted hazard ratio was 3.015 (95% confidence interval = 2.733-3.327). Of cases matched by body mass index, crude rates of diabetes were 4.7 and 2.4 per 1000 patient-years, respectively. The corresponding adjusted hazard ratio was 1.752 (1.514-2.028). No significant difference in BMI-adjusted risk was evident for cancer, LVD, or all-cause mortality. Conclusion(s): During this follow-up period, women with PCOS were not at increased risk of LVD, cancer, or death, but they had increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

N2  - Objective: To compare the polysomnography findings and cardiometabolic function among adolescent girls with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and matched female and male controls. Method(s): Retrospective chart review of electronic medical records of 28 girls with PCOS (age: 16.8 +/- 1.9. years, body mass index (BMI) Z-score 2.4 +/- 0.4), 28 control females (age: 17.1 +/- 1.8, BMI Z-score 2.4 +/- 0.3) and 28 control males (age: 16.6 +/- 1.6, BMI Z-score 2.5 +/- 0.5) in a tertiary care centre. Result(s): The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) was higher in girls with PCOS compared to control females (16/28 (57%) vs. 4/28(14.3%), p<0.01); however, it was comparable to that of the control males (16/28(57%) vs. 21/28(75%), p=0.4). Girls with PCOS had a significantly higher prevalence of insulin resistance compared to control females and control males (20/28 (71.4%) vs. 9/22 (41.0%) (p=0.04) vs. 8/23 (34.8%) (p=0.01). Among girls with PCOS, those with OSA had significantly higher proportions of metabolic syndrome (MetS) (9/16 (56.3%) vs. 1/12 (8.3%) p=0.03), higher insulin resistance (14/16 (87.5%) vs. 6/12 (50%), p=0.04), elevated daytime systolic blood pressure (128.4 +/- 12.8 vs. 115.6 +/- 11.4, p<0.01), lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (38.6 +/- 8.7 vs. 49 +/- 10.9, p=0.01) and elevated triglycerides (TG) (149.7 +/- 87.7 vs. 93.3 +/- 25.8, p=0.03) compared to those without OSA. Conclusion(s): We report a higher prevalence of OSA and metabolic dysfunction in a selected group of obese girls with PCOS referred with sleep-related complaints compared to BMI-matched control girls without PCOS. We also report higher prevalence of cardiometabolic dysfunction in girls with PCOS and OSA compared to girls with PCOS without OSA. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have increased prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. However, data on the incidence of CV events are lacking in this population. Using Rochester Epidemiology Project resources, we conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing CV events in women with PCOS with those of women without PCOS in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Between 1966 and 1988, 309 women with PCOS and 343 without PCOS were identified. Mean (SD) age at PCOS diagnosis was 25.0 (5.3) years; mean age at last follow-up was 46.7 years. Mean (SD) follow-up was 23.7 (13.7) years. Women with PCOS had a higher body mass index (29.4 kg/m2 vs 28.3 kg/m2; p=.01). Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension and levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were similar in the two groups. We observed no increase in CV events, including myocardial infarction (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32 to 1.72; p=.48); coronary artery bypass graft surgery (adjusted HR 1.52; 95% CI 0.42 to 5.48; p=.52); death (adjusted HR 1.03; 95% CI, 0.29 to 3.71; p=.96); death due to CV disease (adjusted HR 5.67; 95% CI 0.51 to 63.7; p=.16); or stroke (adjusted HR 1.05; 95% CI 0.28 to 3.92; p=.94). Although women with PCOS weighed more than controls, there was no increased prevalence of other CV risk factors. Furthermore, we found no increase in CV events. While prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings, women with PCOS do not appear to have adverse CV outcomes in midlife. © Van Zuiden Communications B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: To assess metabolic and endocrine defects in girls genetically predisposed to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Controlled cross-sectional study. Setting(s): University hospital. Patient(s): Nine girls, aged 8-14 years, having a first-degree relative diagnosed with PCOS (PCOSr) and 10 age-matched girls without a family history of PCOS. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Insulin sensitivity (ISFSIVGTT) determined by frequently sampled IV glucose tolerance testing (GTT) and insulin-induced nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) suppression, estimated by the log-linear slope of NEFA levels during the first 20 minutes of GTT. Result(s): In comparison to controls, PCOSr had higher body mass index (BMI) Z-score, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio. Levels of the androgen 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) were significantly increased in PCOSr, independent of adiposity, and inversely correlated with ISFSIVGTT. The ISFSIVGTT was decreased and the NEFA suppression was less steep in PCOSr compared with controls, independent of BMI and 17-OHP. The NEFA suppression was more pronounced with increasing ISFSIVGTT, independent of adiposity. Conclusion(s): Girls at high risk of developing PCOS display increased adiposity and 17-OHP levels, but are mainly characterized by global insulin resistance and resistance to insulin-induced suppression of lipolysis that were independent of adiposity and 17-OHP levels. Therefore, genetic predisposition to PCOS may be related to early insulin resistance and adipocyte dysfunction. © 2012 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Background: The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hyperandrogenic disorder that arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Aim(s): To assess the role of the androgen receptor (AR) CAG repeat polymorphism in the metabolic and reproductive features in daughters of women with PCOS (PCOSd). Method(s): Sixty-seven PCOSd and 60 daughters of control women (Cd) were studied in early stages of sexual development. Sex steroids, glucose, insulin and lipids were determined. The AR CAG repeat sizes and X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) were analyzed. Result(s): PCOSd and Cd had similar mean number of CAG repeats and XCI pattern. In PCOSd and Cd, methylation-weighted biallelic means CAGn (mwCAGn) was not associated with androgen levels. In infants and pubertal PCOSd, mwCAGn was associated with a low concentration of HDL-cholesterol. Conclusion(s): AR CAG repeat polymorphism appears to be unrelated with serum androgen levels. However, the short mwCAGn variant may have a possible impact on the lipid profile in PCOSd. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Context: We have previously described increased serum levels of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and stimulated insulin in daughters of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), suggesting that these girls may have an altered ovarian follicular development which may be modulated by insulin. However, the specific relationship between serum AMH and insulin levels during each Tanner stage of puberty in this cohort has not been established. Objective(s): The aim of our study was to establish the relationship between AMH and poststimulated insulin serum concentrations during each stage of puberty in daughters of women with PCOS (PCOSd), compared to daughters of control women (Cd). Design(s): We studied 135 PCOSd and 93 Cd classified according to their Tanner stage. Gonadotrophins, sex steroids, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and AMH were determined in a fasting sample. Ovarian volume was measured by pelvic ultrasound. In addition, in both groups we performed an oral glucose tolerance test with measurements of glucose and insulin. Result(s): Anti-Mullerian hormone levels were significantly higher in PCOSd compared to Cd at all Tanner stages. Daughters of women with PCOS having AMH concentrations greater than 2 standard deviation (SD) above the mean AMH value for the Cd group showed decreased serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations and increased stimulated levels of insulin during Tanner stages I, II, and III. Conclusion(s): Anti-Mullerian hormone levels are increased in PCOSd during all stages of puberty. We suggest that those PCOSd with the highest AMH levels probably represent a group of girls with more severe ovarian dysfunction and metabolic derangements. © The Author(s) 2012.

N2  - Objective. To evaluate the contribution to glucose intolerance and metabolic syndrome of obesity combined with the diagnostic criteria of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design. Prospective study. Setting. University teaching hospital from 31 August 2010 to 31 August 2011. Population. Two hundred and twenty women with PCOS and seventy normal control women. Methods. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of women with PCOS and control women were evaluated. Main outcome measures. The impact of obesity, hyperandrogenism, oligo-anovulation and polycystic ovary morphology on impaired glucose tolerance and metabolic disturbances. Results. Obese women with PCOS had significantly higher insulin resistance than obese normal control women. Logistic regression analysis showed that obesity was the only factor that predicted impaired glucose tolerance and metabolic syndrome. Use of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for the body mass index to predict impaired glucose tolerance and metabolic syndrome was more accurate than AUROCs for serum total testosterone level and the average menstrual interval. Conclusions. Body weight status was the major factor determining the risk of impaired glucose tolerance and metabolic syndrome in women with PCOS. Obesity should be treated as the major factor determining long-term health consequences associated with PCOS. © 2012 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

N2  - Objective: To document the prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and its associated characteristics in a sample of urban Indigenous women. Design(s): A cross-sectional survey of Indigenous women, including biochemical and anthropometric assessments. PCOS was assessed using the National Institutes of Health 1990 criteria. Setting and participants: Indigenous women, aged 15-44 years, living in a defined area in and around Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia, September 2003 - March 2005. Main Outcome Measure(s): Proportion of participants with PCOS overall and measures of obesity. Result(s): Among 248 women eligible for assessment, the proportion who had PCOS was 15.3% (95% CI, 10.8%-19.8%). The proportion with PCOS was similar across age groups, but was significantly higher (P = 0.001) in women with a body mass index (BMI) of >=30.0 kg/m2 (30.5%) compared with women with a BMI of 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 (8.2%) or a BMI of < 25.0 kg/m2 (7.0%). Conclusion(s): A high proportion of these Indigenous women had PCOS. The significant relationship with obesity gives a strong rationale for screening for PCOS during routine care of Indigenous women who are obese and of reproductive age.

N2  - Objective: To find diagnostic values and thresholds of ovarian volume and follicle number for Turkish patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and to clarify whether the Rotterdam ultrasound criteria are optimal for the diagnosis of PCOS in Turkish patients. Study design: Two hundred and fifty-one newly diagnosed PCOS cases according to Androgen Excess Society (AES) criteria (using clinical and biochemical parameters) and 65 regularly menstruating healthy, non-hirsute, normo-ovulatory volunteers as a control group were taken into the study. Evaluation of the ovaries and measurement of ovarian volumes of all cases were performed by transvaginal ultrasound. Ovarian volume (OV) and follicle number (FN) were recorded in all cases. Result(s): Mean and median OV were 12.5 +/- 8.1 and 10.1 cm3 in PCOS cases. Mean and median FN in the PCOS group were 9.8 +/- 2.8 and 10, respectively. In the control group, the mean and median OV were 5.4 +/- 1.8 and 5.5 cm3. Mean and median FN of controls was 5 +/- 1.5 and 5, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in both OV and FN between PCOS patients and controls (all p < 0.001). Cut off values for ovarian volume in PCOS cases for the Turkish population were determined by receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. The areas under the curve (AUCs) for mean OV and mean FN were 0.938 and 0.998, respectively, indicating a good diagnostic power of the tested variables. Combining sensitivity and specificity using the Youden index, setting the cut off value for threshold OV and FN at 6.43 cm3 and 8, respectively, yielded the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion(s): There may be some differences in ultrasound characteristics of PCOS, resulting in differing diagnostic power and cut off points for different populations. OV and FN have powerful diagnostic value in determination of PCOS with different threshold values for different ethnicities. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background Polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) at ultrasound is currently used in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We hypothesized that the previously proposed threshold value of 12 as an excessive number of follicles per ovary (FN) is no longer appropriate because of current technological developments. In this study, we have revisited the thresholds for FN and for the serum Anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH) level (a possible surrogate for FN) for the definition of PCOM. Methods Clinical, hormonal and ultrasound data were consecutively recorded in 240 patients referred to our department between 2008 and 2010 for exploration of hyperandrogenism (HA), menstrual disorders and/or infertility. Results According to only their symptoms, patients were grouped as: non-PCOS without HA and with ovulatory cycles (group 1, n = 105), presumption of PCOS with only HA or only oligo-anovulation (group 2, n = 73) and PCOS with HA and oligo-anovulation (group 3, n = 62). By cluster analysis using androgens, LH, FSH, AMH, FN and ovarian volume, group 1 appeared to be constituted of two homogeneous clusters, most likely a non-PCOM non-PCOS subgroup (n = 66) and a PCOM, non-PCOS (i.e. asymptomatic) subgroup (n = 39). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was applied to distinguish the non-PCOM non-PCO members of group 1 and to group 3. For FN and serum AMH respectively, the areas under the curve were 0.949 and 0.973 and the best compromise between sensitivity (81 and 92) and specificity (92 and 97) was obtained with a threshold values of 19 follicles and 35 pmol/l (5 ng/ml). Conclusions For the definition of PCOM, the former threshold of >12 for FN is no longer valid. A serum AMH >35 pmol/l (or >5 ng/ml) appears to be more sensitive and specific than a FN >19 and should be therefore included in the current diagnostic classifications for PCOS. © 2011 The Author.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a familial syndrome, associated with multiple cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Thus, parents of affected women may have a higher prevalence of CVD events than the general population. Method(s): PCOS probands (n 410) and their participating parents (n 180 fathers and 211 mothers) were queried for CVD events in themselves and non-participating family members. In order to include the family CVD history of all parents, agreement between the proband and parental reports of CVD events was assessed. Estimated 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk was calculated using the Framingham risk calculator. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 20012002 database was used to generate gender, age and body mass index-relevant population parameters of CVD prevalence in the USA population. Result(s): Ninety-eight percent of the parents self-reporting of CVD events agreed with the probands report of parental heart attack history [Kappa 0.82; 95 CI: (0.69, 0.94)] and 99 with parental stroke history [Kappa=0.79; 95 CI: (0.62, 0.97)]. Fathers of women with PCOS had a higher prevalence of heart attack and stroke compared with the reference NHANES population (heart attack: 11.1 versus 5.3, P < 0.0001; stroke: 3.0 versus 1.0, P 0.002). Fathers of women with PCOS had an elevated 10-year risk for CHD (11.5 versus 9.9 in NHANES, P=0.03). No statistically significant increased prevalence of CVD events or 10-year risk was noted in probands or mothers. Conclusion(s): Fathers, and not mothers, may be disproportionately burdened with CVD in PCOS families. The strengths of this study include the size of our cohort, the consistent phenotyping and the validation of probands reporting of parental CVD events. © 2011 The Author Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The overall risk of developing diabetes mellitus and glucose intolerance seems to be higher in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) than in healthy women. The aim of this long-term follow-up study was to examine glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in middle-aged women previously diagnosed with PCOS in comparison with age-matched healthy controls. Methods Women diagnosed with PCOS between 1987 and 1995 were invited to participate in the study. A total of 84 PCOS patients and 87 control subjects participated. Anthropometric (BMI, waist/hip ratio) and metabolic parameters (oral glucose tolerance test) were measured. Insulin sensitivity was expressed by the Matsuda index and beta cell function by the insulinogenic index. PCOS women were subgrouped according to phenotype at the index assessment (with or without hyperandrogenism) and persistence of PCOS symptoms at the follow-up (persisting or resolved PCOS). Results Eighteen (21.4%) PCOS patients and four (4.5%) controls had developed type 1 or type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) at the follow-up investigation (P < 0.05). Matsuda insulin sensitivity index was lower and the insulinogenic index was increased in women with previously diagnosed PCOS compared with control subjects. In addition, PCOS patients with or without hyperandrogenism, and PCOS patients with persisting and resolved PCOS all had lower Matsuda insulin sensitivity index and increased insulinogenic index in comparison with controls. CONCLUSIONS IGT and type 2 diabetes occurred more often in PCOS patients. Independent on PCOS phenotype at index assessment and persistence of PCOS symptoms at the follow-up investigation, women with PCOS had lower insulin sensitivity but a well-preserved beta cell function in comparison with control subjects. © The Author 2011.

N2  - Intriguing studies suggest that osteocalcin (OC) and its carboxylated (Gla)/uncarboxylated form are involved in the regulation of insulin secretion and action. Additionally, advanced glycated end products (AGEs) directly regulate the secretion of these osteoblast-derived molecules. In polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), among the pathophysiological aberrations, deregulation of insulin secretion and action as well as elevated AGEs levels have been demonstrated. In this study, we evaluated the serum levels of osteocalcin and Gla osteocalcin and their possible associations with metabolic, hormonal, and ultrasonographic components of PSOS: 97 women were studied, 50 PCOS patients and 47 controls, matched for age and body mass index (BMI). In each subject, the levels of bone metabolism markers have been evaluated, and metabolic and hormonal profiles as well as ovarian ultrasound were carried out. Osteocalcin (4.30 +/- 1.74 vs. 6.20 +/- 1.78 ng/ml, P\0.0005) values were significantly lower, whereas Gla osteocalcin (37.93 +/- 6.87 vs. 9.64 +/- 8.21 ng/ml, P\ 0.0005) and receptor activator for nuclear factor-jB ligand (0.54 +/- 0.26 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.15 pmol/l, P\0.0005) values were significantly higher in PCOS subjects compared to the control group, independently of obesity. A significant association was disclosed between osteocalcin and Gla osteocalcin with androgens, insulin resistance, AGEs, and ovarian morphology. Receiver operating curve analysis revealed that Gla osteocalcin [AUC, 0.975 (95% CI, 0.93- 1.00)] as well as AGEs are significant prognostic factors of PCOS [AUC, 0.986 (95% CI, 0.97-1.00)]. Lower osteocalcin and elevated serum levels of its carboxylated form are displayed in PCOS subjects and are associated with several PCOS components. These findings suggest a potential interaction between bone-derived markers and the metabolic/hormonal abnormalities observed in PCOS. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms and moreover the possible clinical implications require further investigation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

N2  - Objective: To determine the pre-malignant and malignant potential of endometrial polyps and to assess whether different clinical parameters are associated with malignancy in the polyps of premenopausal women. Method(s): The clinical records of operative office hysteroscopic and resectoscopic procedures for endometrial polyps in 417 premenopausal women who attended Baskent University were examined over a retrospective period of 30 months. Only premenopausal patients were included in the study. Result(s): In 97.8% of women, histology showed benign endometrial pathology. In 2.2% of women, pre-malignant or malignant conditions were found in the polyp. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the presence of 2 or more polyps were associated with significant pre-malignant or malignant changes. Conclusion(s): The presence of irregular vaginal bleeding was not a predictor of malignancy in the polyp. Premenopausal women with PCOS and those with 2 or more polyps had an increased prevalence of polyp malignancy. These groups of patients, whether symptomatic or not, should be evaluated by hysteroscopic resection of the polyps. © 2010 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Background: There is no clear and contemporaneous method for screening of idiopathic hirsutism (IH) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) at the community level and current estimates regarding their prevalence are limited. We aimed to ascertain the prevalence of IH and PCOS in a randomly selected sample of reproductive aged female participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS). Method(s): One thousand and two women, aged 18-45 years, were randomly selected from among reproductive aged women who participated in the TLGS. Those women with either hirsutism or menstrual dysfunction were assessed for biochemical hyperandrogenemia; whereas those participants with hirsutism per se were further assessed for subclinical menstrual dysfunction. PCOS were diagnosed using the National Institute of Health (NIH) criteria. IH was defined as hirsutism without clinical or sub clinical menstrual dysfunction or biochemical hyperandrogenemia (BH). Result(s): The mean +/- SD of age of study population was 29.2 +/- 8.7 years. Estimated prevalences of idiopathic hirsutism and pure menstrual dysfunction were 13.0% (95% CI: 10.9%-15.1%) and 1.5%(95% CI: 1.1%-1.9%), respectively. The prevalence of PCOS was 8.5% (95% CI: 6.8% - 10.2%); more than one third of these cases would possibly have remained undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, had we not assessed them for subclinical menstrual dysfunction or biochemical hyperandrogenemia. Conclusion(s): These data from a large representative and non selected population of women confirm the concept that IH and PCOS are the two most common gynecological endocrinopathies among reproductive aged women. The estimated prevalence of these conditions is highly influenced by their screening methods at the community level. © 2011 Tehrani et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is defined by hyperan- drogenism (HA) and ovarian dysfunction, but is also characterised by insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic anomalies. The aim of this study was to verify whether metabolic and endocrine perturbations develop early in girls genetically linked to PCOS. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 9 girls aged 8-14 years having a relative (mother or sister) diagnosed with PCOS (PCOSr) and 10 girls of similar age with no PCOS relative. Anthropometry and pubertal stage (Tanner) were assessed. A 2h oral glucose tolerance test and a 3h frequently sampled intra-venous glucose tolerance test (FSivGTT) were performed to determine insulin sensitivity (IS). Androgens and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were assayed. Insulin-induced NEFA suppression (NEFAsupp) was estimated by the negative slope of decreasing NEFA levels (on log scale) during the first 20 min of FSivGTT. Groups were compared with Wilcoxon tests and correlations were verified by Spearman tests. Adjustments were made by ANCOVA, using log-transformed variables when required. RESULT(S): In comparison to controls, PCOSr had higher body mass index (BMI) (P<0.05) and decreased IS (P=0.003). Levels of the androgen 17OH- progesterone (17Pg) were increased in PCOSr (P=0.03), independently of adiposity (Ps>=0.05) or Tanner stage (>=2vs >2), but not of IS. Indeed, 17Pg was strongly correlated with IS (P=0.0003) even after correction for Tanner stage (P=0.0007). Finally, NEFAsupp was decreased in PCOSr(P=0.004) as compared to controls, independently of Tanner stage (P=0.02), adiposity (Ps>=0.01), 17Pg (P=0.05) or BMI & 17Pg (P=0.05). NEFAsupp was correlated with IS (P=0.02). CONCLUSION(S): Girls at high risk of developing PCOS presents elevated adiposity, IR and HA, but are mainly characterized by resistance to insulin-induced lipolysis, independently of adiposity. We thus report the first evidence that genetic predisposition to PCOS may be related to early adipocyte dysfunction.

N2  - Introduction: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) frequently suffer from metabolic disturbances and might be affected by hepatic steatosis. The fatty liver index (FLI) was developed as a simple and accurate predictor of hepatic steatosis. We aimed to analyze the association of FLI with endocrine and metabolic parameters in a cohort of PCOS and control women. Method(s): FLI was calculated using body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, triglycerides, and gamma-glutamyl transferase in 611 PCOS and 139 BMI-matched control women within the same age range. Elevated FLI was defined as >60. Metabolic, endocrine, and anthropometric measurements and oral glucose tolerance tests were performed. Result(s): PCOS women had significantly higher FLI levels than control women in age-adjusted analyses (11.4 (4.3-48.8) and 8.8 (3.9-35.0), respectively, P=0.001), whereas fibrosis indices were similar (aspartate amino transferase-to-platelet ratio index) or lower (FIB-4) respectively. In binary logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, odds ratio (OR) for elevated FLI was 2.52 (1.31-4.85), P=0.006, for PCOS women when compared with controls. PCOS women with high FLI levels had an adverse anthropometric, metabolic, and endocrine risk profile. The prevalence of elevated FLI was 88.7% in PCOS women with metabolic syndrome (MS) and 11.3% in PCOS women without MS (P<0.001). In control women, elevated FLI was present in 66.7% of women with MS and 30.8% of women without MS. Conclusion(s): High FLI levels are a common finding in obese PCOS women and are closely linked to MS. FLI calculation might be a useful tool for identifying PCOS patients at high risk for metabolic and hepatic disturbances. © 2011 European Society of Endocrinology.

N2  - Objective: To assess the relationship between antimullerian hormone (AMH) and parameters related to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Prospective study. Setting(s): Academic tertiary care center. Patient(s): A total of 290 women. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Parameters related to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Result(s): Women with polycystic ovary morphology had significantly higher AMH levels than women in the control group. The prevalence of PCOS increased from 21% in the low-AMH (<4 ng/mL) group to 37% in the moderate-AMH (4-11 ng/mL) group and 80% in the high-AMH (>11 ng/mL) group. However, significant differences in insulin resistance parameters were not observed among groups. The results of the correlation analysis revealed that AMH levels were positively correlated with LH, total T, A, and total cholesterol content; however, AMH levels were negatively correlated with age, body mass index, and the number of menstrual cycles per year. AMH levels were not correlated with insulin resistance parameters. Conclusion(s): Elevated serum AMH levels increase the risk of PCOS but do not affect the risk of insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. © 2011 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - We hypothesized that adolescent oligomenorrhea (ages 14-19) would independently predict impaired fasting glucose (IFG; >=110 to <126 mg/dL) plus type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; >=126 mg/dL), insulin and glucose levels, and insulin resistance (IR) in young adulthood (ages 19-25). A prospective 15-year follow-up of 370 schoolgirls starting at age 10 was performed. Age 14 waist circumference was the most important explanatory variable for IFG + T2DM during ages 19 to 24 (P =.002; odds ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.10), along with oligomenorrhea category from ages 14 to 19 (0, 1, 2, >=3 reports over 6 years; P =.032; odds ratio, 1.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-3.14). Impaired fasting glucose + T2DM at ages 19 to 24 were more common in girls having 1 (6%), 2 (11%), and >=3 (38%) oligomenorrhea reports from ages 14 to 19 than in girls without oligomenorrhea (3%; P =.0003). Positive explanatory variables (all Ps <=.05) for homeostasis model assessment of IR at ages 19 to 24 included age 14 waist (partial R2 = 30.1%), oligomenorrhea with hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary syndrome; partial R 2 = 4.1%), black race (3.8%), and oligomenorrhea frequency during ages 14 to 19 (0.8%); sex hormone binding globulin was a negative explanatory variable (0.7%). This is the first prospective study to report an independent association of adolescent oligomenorrhea with young adult IFG + T2DM, with insulin and glucose levels, and with IR. Age 14 waist circumference, oligomenorrhea with hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary syndrome), black race, oligomenorrhea frequency at ages 14 to 19, and age 14 sex hormone binding globulin were independently associated with IR at ages 19 to 24, potentially facilitating primary prevention of IFG, T2DM, and hyperinsulinemia. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between ovarian volume (OV) and mean platelet volume (MPV) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Hormonal parameters and lipid profile of cases, and their relationship to OV were also assessed. Bilateral OV of 210 newly diagnosed PCOS patients and 100 healthy non-hirsute women were measured by ultrasonography. Blood samples were obtained for full blood count, hormone levels and for lipid profiles. It was found that MPV increased gradually as OV increased. This implies a higher risk of hypercoagulability and therefore an increased risk of future cardiovascular disease. © 2011 Spandidos Publications Ltd.

N2  - The aim of this study was to compare polysomnographic variables of obese adolescents with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) to those of healthy controls and to analyse whether polysomnographic variables correlate to parameters of body weight/body composition, to serum androgens and to parameters of glucose metabolism. Thirty-one obese adolescents with PCOS (15.0years+/-1.0, body mass index 32.7kg per m2+/-6.2) and 19 healthy obese adolescents without PCOS (15.2years+/-1.1, body mass index 32.4kg per m2+/-4.0) underwent polysomnography to compare apnoea index, hypopnoea index, apnoea-hypopnoea index, the absolute number of obstructive apnoeas, percentage sleep Stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, percentage of REM sleep, TIB, total sleep time (TST), sleep-onset latency, total wake time (TWT), wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO) and sleep efficiency. Furthermore, we correlated polysomnographic variables to parameters of body weight/body composition, to serum androgens and to parameters of glucose metabolism. We found no differences between the two groups concerning the respiratory indices, percentage sleep Stages 2, 3 and 4 of NREM sleep, TIB and sleep-onset latency. The girls with PCOS differed significantly from the controls regarding TST, WASO, TWT, sleep efficiency, percentage Stage 1 of NREM sleep and percentage of REM sleep. We found a weak significant correlation between insulin resistance and apnoea index and between insulin resistance and apnoea-hypopnoea index. Concerning the respiratory variables, adolescents with PCOS do not seem to differ from healthy controls; however, there seem to be differences concerning sleep architecture. © 2010 European Sleep Research Society.

N2  - Objective: To study hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a tool for diagnosing diabetes and to study HbA1c as a cardiovascular risk marker in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Retrospective observational study. Setting(s): Academic tertiary-care medical center. Patient(s): Two hundred eight premenopausal women with PCOS. Intervention(s): Patients underwent clinical evaluation (Ferriman-Gallwey score, body mass index, waist, blood pressure), hormone analyses (T, sex hormone-binding globulin, fasting lipids, insulin, glucose, HbA1c), transvaginal ultrasound, and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) measuring capillary blood glucose (BG) at 0 (BG 0) and 120 (BG 120) minutes, insulin, and C-peptide. Main Outcome Measure(s): Results of OGTT, HbA1c values. Result(s): Twenty patients were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes during OGTT. The sensitivity and specificity of HbA1c >=6.5% for the diagnosis of diabetes were 35% and 99%, respectively, compared with the diagnosis established by OGTT. Hemoglobin A1c showed closer correlation with waist, body mass index, and lipid profile than BG 120, suggesting that HbA1c could be a cardiovascular risk marker. Conclusion(s): The clinical utility of HbA1c for diagnosing impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes in PCOS in daily practice is low. Long-term prospective studies are needed to determine whether HbA1c is superior to glucose levels as a cardiovascular risk marker in patients with PCOS. © 2011 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with the metabolic syndrome and, consequently, with a potentially increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related mortality later in life. Studies regarding CVD and mortality in PCOS women well into the postmenopausal age are lacking. Objective(s): Our objective was to examine whether postmenopausal PCOS women differ from controls regarding cardiovascular risk factors, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and mortality. Design and Setting: We conducted, at a university hospital, a prospective study of 35 PCOS women (61-79 yr) and 120 age-matched controls. The study was performed 21 yr after the initial study. Participant(s): Twenty-five PCOS women (Rotterdam criteria) and 68 controls participated in all examinations. Data on morbidity were based on 32 of 34 PCOS women and on 95 of 119 controls. Intervention(s): Interventions included reexamination, interviews, and data from the National Board of Health and Welfare and from the Hospital Discharge Registry. Main Outcome Measure(s): Blood pressure, glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein, apolipoprotein A1 and B, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor antigen were studied. Incidences of MI, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, cause of death, and age at death were recorded. Result(s): PCOS women had a higher prevalence of hypertension (P = 0.008) and higher triglyceride levels (P = 0.012) than controls. MI, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and mortality prevalence was similar in the two cohorts with similar body mass index. Conclusion(s): The well-described cardiovascular/metabolic risk profile in pre- and perimenopausal PCOS women does not entail an evident increase in cardiovascular events during the postmenopausal period.

N2  - Background. There is evidence of familial occurrence of metabolic disturbances in first-degree relatives of women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Objectives. The aim of this study was to establish whether siblings of women with PCOS have the metabolic abnormalities that are typical of PCOS. Material and Methods. Forty-four sisters and forty-two brothers of women with PCOS were recruited. There were two control groups consisting of 70 healthy women and 30 healthy men. Anthropometric and metabolic parameters (glucose and insulin, fasting and during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT 30', 60' and 120'), insulin-sensitivity and insulin-resistance indexes, lipidogram) were assessed in all subjects. Results. In comparison with the controls, siblings of women with PCOS had higher glucose levels, higher insulin levels at 120' and higher mean insulin levels during the OGTT. There were no differences in the insulin-sensitivity indexes or insulin resistance indexes between siblings and the controls. The total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were higher in sisters and brothers of women with PCOS than in the controls. Conclusions. Siblings of patients with PCOS are predisposed to some metabolic abnormalities, such as higher fasting glycemia, glucose intolerance and a more adverse lipid profile than the controls. Insulin resistance in PCOS families is related mainly to obesity and seems not to have a genetic background. © Copyright by Wroclaw Medical University.

N2  - Objective Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with dyslipidaemia and obesity. It is not clear whether the dyslipidaemia of PCOS is attributable to PCOS itself, obesity, or a combination of both. Our objective was to assess the importance of familial dyslipidaemia in PCOS by comparing fasting lipids between probands and their (affected and nonaffected) sisters. Design Retrospective data set analyses. Patients Family study; 157 probands, 214 sisters and 76 control women (normal ovaries and regular cycles). All probands had PCOS, defined by symptoms of anovulation and/or hyperandrogenism with polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. Affected or unaffected status of sisters was defined by ovarian morphology. Measurements Serum concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Results Triglyceride levels and body mass index (BMI) were higher and HDL cholesterol levels were lower in the probands than affected sisters, unaffected sisters and controls. These differences in lipid profiles between the groups disappeared after adjustment for BMI. No differences in lipids were seen between affected and unaffected sisters. Conclusions These data are consistent with heritability of lipid levels in sisters but strongly suggest that the predominant influence on the manifestation of dyslipidaemia in PCOS is body weight. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Background: PCOS is a common female endocrine disorder with prevalence ranging from 2.2% to 26%. Most reports have studied adult women with age ranged from 18 to 45 years. The aim of this study was to find the prevalence of PCOS in Indian adolescents. Method(s): We prospectively studied 460 girls aged 15 to 18 years from a residential college in Andhra Pradesh, South India, who underwent clinical examination. Out of which 72 girls with oligomenorrhea and/or hirsutism were invited for biochemical, hormonal, and ultrasonographic evaluation for diagnosis of PCOS by Rotterdam criteria.PCOS was defined as the presence of any two of the three features: (1) Oligo/amenorrhea: absence of menstruation for 45 days or more and/or <=8 menses per year. (2) Clinical hyperandrogenism: Modified Ferriman and Gallway (mFG) score of 6 or higher. (3) Polycystic ovaries: presence of >10 cysts, 2-8 mm in diameter, usually combined with increased ovarian volume of >10 cm3, and an echo-dense stroma in pelvic ultrasound scan. Result(s): Out of 460 girls, one (0.22%) had oligo/amenorrhea with clinical hyperandrogenism, 29 (6.30%) had oligomenorrhea with polycystic ovaries, one (0.22%) had polycystic ovaries with clinical hyperandrogenism and 11 (2.39%) had oligomenorrhea with polycystic ovaries in the presence of clinical hyperandrogenism. Thus 42 (9.13%) girls satisfied Rotterdam's criteria for PCOS, which increased to 50.46 (10.97%) when imputed data were included. Conclusion(s): Prevalence of PCOS in Indian adolescents is 9.13%.This draws attention to the issue of early diagnosis in adolescent girls. © 2011 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

N2  - Background: Both non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are associated with metabolic syndrome (MS) and insulin resistance (IR). Except for a few case reports, there are no systematic assessments of NASH in PCOS patients. Aim. To determine the prevalence of NASH and independent factors associated with NASH in a cohort of patients with documented PCOS. Methods. Patients with established diagnosis of PCOS and matched controls (matched for gender, age, and body mass index (BMI)) were included in the study. Causes of other liver diseases were systematically excluded by clinical and laboratory tests. Excessive alcohol use was defined as alcohol consumption of greater than 10 g/day. All liver biopsies were read by a single pathologist blinded to the clinical data. Histologic NASH was defined as steatosis with lobular inflammation and ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes with or without Mallory-Denk bodies or pericellular fibrosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses with logistic regression were performed to compare PCOS to matched controls. Results. Sixty-six patients were included in the study (34 PCOS and 32 matched controls). Of PCOS patients, 73% had a liver biopsy while 78% of the matched controls had a liver biopsy. In comparing PCOS patients to the matched controls, clinical (BMI, waist circumference, type 2 diabetes, MS, or its components, any alcohol consumption in the prior year, ethnic background, age, gender, etc.) and laboratory data (aminotransferases, ferritin, glucose, etc.) were not significantly different (p > 0.05). However, PCOS patients tended to have more histologic NASH on their liver biopsies (44.0% vs. 20.8%, p = 0.08). Independent predictors of histologic NASH in PCOS patients were elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), high triglycerides and small amounts of alcohol consumption (p = 0.019, 10-fold cross-validated AUC = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.56-0.94). Although about half of PCOS patients did not report any alcohol consumption, 50% did report rare alcohol use. In fact, PCOS patients with histologic NASH tended to report higher alcohol consumption per week than PCOS without NASH (3.80 +/- 6.16 vs. 1.11 +/- 1.87 g/week, p = 0.1). Nevertheless, these amounts of alcohol consumption were quite minimal. Conclusions. Despite similar clinical and laboratory profiles to the matched controls, PCOS patients seem to have more histologic NASH. Although alcohol consumption was rare for both PCOS and controls, even rare alcohol consumption in PCOS patients was independently associated with histologic NASH. © 2011 Informa Healthcare.

N2  - Objective: To estimate whether women aged 20-32 years who fulfilled National Institutes of Health criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) would be at higher risk for subsequent development of incident diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, and to estimate whether normal-weight women with PCOS would have the same degree of cardiovascular risk as overweight women with PCOS. Method(s): We estimated the association of PCOS with incident diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension over a period of 18 years among 1,127 white and African-American women in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort. We classified women at baseline (ages 20-32 years) based on self-reported symptoms and serum androgen measures using National Institutes of Health PCOS criteria. We estimated the association of PCOS and subsequent cardiovascular risk factors, independent of baseline body mass index (BMI), using multivariable logistic regression. Additionally, among 746 women with a second assessment of PCOS at ages 34-46 years, we estimated the association of persistent PCOS with cardiovascular risk factors. Result(s): Of 1,127 women, 53 (4.7%) met criteria for PCOS at ages 20-32 years. Polycystic ovary syndrome was associated with a twofold higher odds of incident diabetes (23.1% compared with 13.1%, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.4, confidence interval [CI] 1.2-4.9) and dyslipidemia (41.9% compared with 27.7%, AOR 1.9, CI 1.0-3.6) over the course of 18 years; the association with incident hypertension was not significant (26.9% compared with 26.3%, AOR 1.7, CI 0.8-3.3). Normal-weight women with PCOS (n=31) had a threefold higher odds of incident diabetes compared with normal-weight women without PCOS (AOR 3.1, CI 1.2-8.0). Compared with those without PCOS, women with persistent PCOS (n=11) had the highest odds of diabetes (AOR 7.2, CI 1.1-46.5). Conclusion(s): Polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with subsequent incident diabetes and dyslipidemia, independent of BMI. Diabetes risk may be greatest for women with persistent PCOS symptoms. © 2010 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Background: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in Iranian women based on different diagnostic criteria. Material(s) and Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2009 in Isfahan, Iran among females referred to the mandatory pre-marriage screening clinic. Menstrual irregularity was assessed as the presence of chronic amenorrhea or a menstrual cycle length of less than 21 days or more than 35 days, or more than four days of variation between cycles. Clinical hyperandrogenism was assessed as the self-reported degree of hirsutism using the modified Ferriman Gallwey (mF-G) scoring method based on a chart displaying degree of hair growth in nine regions. Those participants who reported menstrual irregularity and/or who had an mF-G score of >= 8 were invited for a clinical examination. Those who did not have these criteria were not further evaluated and were deemed not to have PCOS. Participants with abnormal findings underwent blood test and abdominal sonography of their ovaries. In those with hirsutism, serum was obtained on the 22nd-24th day of the cycle for the measurement of progesterone; free testosterone was measured in those with menstrual irregularity. Result(s): The estimated prevalence of PCOS was 7% based on the NIH criteria, 15.2% under the Rotterdam criteria, and 7.92% according to the AES criteria. Conclusion(s): The Rotterdam prevalence estimates were double those obtained with the NIH criteria. This study can be used for international comparisons because it was conducted on a representative sample of females using different criteria for the definition of PCOS.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of hyperandrogenism on metabolic disorders among patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of the clinical records of 883 women with PCOS and 717 premenopausal controls identified from the general population. Result(s): A total of 686 (77.7%) patients were classified with PCOS based on National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, and 164 out of 197 (83.2%) additional patients had no hyperandrogenism. Women with normal androgen levels exhibited lower frequencies of obesity, type 2 diabetes, acanthosis nigricans, genetic history of diabetes, and elevated Matsuda index compared with hyperandrogenic patients. Hyperandrogenemia, but not hirsutism, was independently associated with the risk for type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 5.7; P = 0.028) and obesity (OR 1.7; P = 0.005) among Chinese patients with PCOS. Conclusion(s): Hyperandrogenemia is associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity in Chinese women with PCOS and should be considered at first-line management of hyperandrogenism and infertility due to PCOS. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To assess the influence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) on respiratory events during sleep in nonobese Taiwanese women. Method(s): Overnight polysomnography was recorded in 18 nonobese women with PCOS who had not received treatment (body mass index [BMI] 21.7 +/- 0.57, age 29.1 +/- 1.43 years) and in 10 age- and BMI-matched women without PCOS (BMI 20.9 +/- 0.58, age 31.6 +/- 3.87 years). Result(s): The nonobese women with PCOS had a higher total apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) especially during the non-rapid eye movement stage (AHINREM) than the women who did not have PCOS. The women with PCOS had higher serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and this was positively correlated with AHIREM. Total testosterone level was positively correlated with AHINREM, and androstenedione was negatively correlated with AHINREM. Conclusion(s): PCOS was directly linked to increased obstructive respiratory events during sleep in nonobese women in Taiwan. © 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

A1  - Bhattacharya S.M. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Objectives: To compare the prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and controls, and assess risk factors associated with PCOS. Method(s): A fasting oral glucose tolerance test after ingestion of 75 g of glucose was administered to 264 women with and 116 without PCOS. Moreover, fasting glucose, insulin, and testosterone levels were measured in the women with PCOS. Body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were calculated for each woman with PCOS. Result(s): The AGT prevalence was 14.4% in the PCOS group and 11.2% in the control group (P = 0.17). The women with both PCOS and AGT had significantly higher BMIs, WHRs, testosterone levels, and HOMA-IR values than those with normal glucose tolerance. Conclusion(s): While AGT was not associated with PCOS, the women with both PCOS and AGT were significantly more obese, hyperandrogenic, and insulin resistant than those with PCOS and normal glucose tolerance. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background: Adults with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can have multiple metabolic abnormalities. However, studies in the adolescent population are still limited and these results seem to vary widely. This study was to investigate the metabolic abnormalities in adolescents with PCOS in South China and the potential risk factors contributed to these health risks. Method(s): Anthropometric measurements and biochemical parameters were evaluated in 128 adolescents with PCOS and their age- and BMI-matched controls. Result(s): The prevalence of pre-diabetes, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome in adolescents with PCOS was 11.7%, 46.9%, 29.7%, 22.7% and 4.7%, respectively. 16.3%, 74.4%, 67.4%, 39.5% and 14% of the PCOS subjects with BMI > 85th had pre-diabetes, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome, whereas 9.4%, 32.9%, 10.6%, 14.1% and 0% of the PCOS subjects with BMI < 85th had such disturbances. Conclusion(s): Adolescents with PCOS in South China had more metabolic abnormalities than their age- and BMI-matched non-PCOS counterparts. Obesity could worsen insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and metabolic syndrome in PCOS adolescents. © 2010 Huang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature to determine whether there is an association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and gynaecological malignancy. Medline and Embase databases (1968-2008) were searched to identify publications on the association between PCOS and gynaecological cancers including breast cancer. Studies were selected that examined the association between PCOS and all types of gynaecological malignancies. A total of 19 studies exploring the association between PCOS and breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer were identified. Of these, only eight could be included after review. The data showed variability in the definition of PCOS. A meta-analysis of the data suggests that women with PCOS are more likely to develop cancer of the endometrium (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.00-7.29) and ovarian cancer (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.08-5.89) but not breast cancer (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.44-1.77). Women with PCOS appear to be three times more likely to develop endometrial cancer but are not at increased risk of breast cancer. There is insufficient evidence to implicate PCOS in the development of vaginal, vulval, cervical or ovarian cancers. The paucity of studies investigating the association between PCOS and gynaecological cancers is likely to affect the reliability of the conclusions.

N2  - Background/Aims: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been found to affect 4-8% of women of reproductive age; however, in Mexican-Americans a prevalence of 12.8% has been reported. This study determines the prevalence of PCOS in a sample of Mexican women. Method(s): This prospective cross-sectional study included 150 female Mexican volunteers aged 20-45 years. Menstrual cycles were recorded and hirsutism was graded. Pelvic ultrasound was performed and androgen levels were measured. PCOS was diagnosed by hyperandrogenism and/or hyperandrogenemia, and oligo-ovulation (NIH 1990 criteria), and also by 2 of 3 findings: oligo-ovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries (PCO) (Rotterdam 2003 criteria), excluding other disorders. Result(s): Nine of the 150 women were diagnosed with PCOS, a prevalence of 6.0% (95% CI: 1.9-10.1%), according to NIH criteria. The ultrasound morphology added one patient to give ten PCOS patients, a prevalence of 6.6% (95% CI: 2.3-10.9%) according to Rotterdam criteria. All PCOS patients presented oligo-ovulation, 9 had hirsutism and 7 of them had acne. Eight of the 10 PCOS patients had morphologic characteristics of PCO. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of PCOS in Mexican women is approximately 6.0%, similar to other populations, but lower than 12.8% reported in Mexican-American women. © 2010 S. Karger AG, Base.

N2  - Objective: Although polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is commonly cited as a risk factor for endometrial cancer, supporting epidemiological evidence is currently very limited. Our aim was to assess the associations between PCOS, PCOS symptoms, and risk of endometrial cancer in women aged less than 50 years. Method(s): Data came from a national population-based case-control study in Australia. Cases with newly diagnosed histologically confirmed endometrial cancer were identified through treatment clinics and cancer registries Australia wide. Controls were randomly selected from the national electoral roll. Women were interviewed about their reproductive and medical history, including self-reported PCOS, and lifestyle. Current analyses were restricted to women aged under 50 (156 cases, 398 controls). We estimated odds ratios (OR) using logistic regression to adjust for confounding factors. Result(s): Women with PCOS had a fourfold increased risk of endometrial cancer compared to women without PCOS (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.7-9.3). This association was attenuated when additionally adjusted for body mass index (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.9-5.7). Risk was slightly greater when restricted to Type I cancers. PCOS symptoms including hirsutism and very irregular periods were significantly associated with endometrial cancer risk. Conclusion(s): These data extend existing findings, including adjustment for confounders, suggesting PCOS is a risk factor for endometrial cancer. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

N2  - Purpose: The objective of this study was evaluate influence of body mass index (BMI), hyperinsulinemia and/or insulin resistance (IR), and androgens on the lipid profile of adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): A total of 71 PCOS and 94 healthy adolescent girls from a Southern Italian region were included in the study. At day 5-8 of menstrual cycle, patients underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test to evaluate insulin levels; lipid and homocysteine levels were also assessed, baseline hormonal assays and ultrasound examination performed, and anthropometric characteristics measured. Result(s): No differences were observed in the incidence of overweight or obesity and total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level; triglycerides and homocysteine levels did not differ between PCOS and control groups. All fasting metabolic indexes were similar, whereas insulin secretion after glucose load (I-AUC) was significantly higher in PCOS subjects. Total cholesterol levels were significantly related to waist-hip ratio (WHR). Low-density lipoprotein level was positively correlated with BMI, waist, WHR, and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) but not I-AUC. Findings obtained for HDL correlated negatively to the same parameters, being also negatively correlated to both fasting insulin and HOMA, but not I-AUC. Moreover, HDL was positively correlated to circulating androstenedione (A) and negatively to circulating testosterone (T) levels. Triglycerides seemed to correlate positively with body BMI, waist, and WHR, and negatively with A levels. Homocysteine levels correlated positively with plasma triglyceride content. Conclusion(s): In the adolescent population studied, no differences were revealed in lipid profile between PCOS and controls. The PCOS is not a discriminant factor. The anthropometric characteristics resulted in the primary factor influencing the lipid derangement, confirming the importance of treating obesity at an early age to reduce morbidity rates. Hyperinsulinemia and IR, peculiarities of PCOS capable of influencing long-term evolution into cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus, are not associated with worse lipid profile. Young patients should be encouraged and motivated to change their lifestyle, with the aim of losing weight and thus reducing risk of onset of overt dyslipidemia. © 2010 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

N2  - Context: Low birthweight has been associated with metabolic and reproductive abnormalities in adults. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between birthweight and gestational age and its association with reproductive and metabolic phenotypes in women with PCOS and their first-degree relatives. Design and Setting: We conducted a family-based study of PCOS at an academic health center. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 1038 individuals (845 females and 193 males) from the cohort and 168 controls participated in the study. Main Outcome Measure(s): The association between birthweight and familial phenotype was measured. Result(s): Self-reported and actual birthweight were highly correlated [Spearman correlation coefficient (r) = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66, 0.89; P = 0.001) and concordant (concordance correlation coefficient =0.86; 95% lower limit=0.78). We noted that birthweight for both genders in PCOS families and controls fell within the 10th and 90th percentiles for gestational age based on U.S. population norms. The 50th percentiles for a gestational age of 40 wk were very similar (3409 g in PCOS, 3455 g for controls, and 3495 g for the United States). There were no significant associations between phenotype and birthweight in PCOS probands. Furthermore, there were not any significant relationships between phenotype and birthweight in female or male family members of the PCOS probands. Conclusion(s): Birthweight in PCOS families mirrors control and U.S. population data, even corrected for gestational age, and has no substantive association with reproductive and metabolic abnormalities in women with PCOS, their female relatives, or their male relatives.

N2  - Context: Despite the high prevalence of hyperandrogenemia, the principal biochemical abnormality in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a definitive endocrine marker for PCOS has so far not been identified. Objective(s): To identify a tentative diagnostic marker for PCOS, we compared serum levels of sex steroids, their precursors, and main metabolites in women with PCOS and controls. Design and Methods: In this cross-sectional study of 74 women with PCOS and 31 controls, we used gas and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to analyze serum sex steroid precursors, estrogens, androgens, and glucuronidated androgen metabolites; performed immunoassays of SHBG, LH, and FSH; and calculated the LH/FSH ratio. Result(s): Androgens and estrogens, sex steroid precursors, and glucuronidated androgen metabolites were higher in women with PCOS than in controls. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, estrone and free testosterone were independently associated with PCOS. The odds ratios per SD increase were 24.2 for estrone [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0 -144.7] and 12.8 for free testosterone (95% CI, 3.1-53.4). In receiver operating characteristic analyses, the area under curve was 0.93 for estrone (95% CI, 0.88-0.98) and 0.91 for free testosterone (95% CI, 0.86-0.97), indicating high sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS have elevated levels of sex steroid precursors, estrogens, androgens, and glucuronidated androgen metabolites as measured with a specific and sensitive mass spectrometry-based technique. The combination of elevated estrone (>50 pg/ml) and free testosterone (>3.3 pg/ml) appeared to discriminate with high sensitivity and specificity between women with and without PCOS.

N2  - Context: In some patients, PCOS may develop as a consequence of an exaggerated adrenarche during pubertal development. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to assess adrenal function during childhood and pubertal development in daughters of women with PCOS (PCOSd). Design(s): We included 98 PCOSd [64 during childhood (ages 4-8 yr) and 34 during the peripubertal period (ages 9-13 yr)] and 51 daughters of controlwomen(Cd) [30 during childhood and 21 during the peripubertal period]. In both groups, an acute ACTH-(1-24) stimulation test (0.25 mg) and an oral glucose tolerance test were performed. Bone age and serum concentrations of cortisol, androstenedione, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEAS), glucose, and insulin were determined. Result(s): PCOSd and Cd were similar in age and body mass index. During the peripubertal period, basal and poststimulated DHEAS concentrations were higher in PCOSd compared to Cd. Among PCOSd, 12.5% of girls in childhood and 32.4% in peripuberty presented biochemical evidence of exaggerated adrenarche. Stimulated insulin was higher in PCOSd compared to Cd during childhood (P = 0.03) and peripuberty (P = 0.03). An advancement of 8 months between bone and chronological age was observed in peripubertal PCOSd compared to Cd. Conclusion(s): In PCOSd, basal and stimulated DHEAS concentrations were higher during the onset of puberty. Around 30% of the PCOSd demonstrated an exacerbated adrenarche, which may reflect increased P450c17 activity. In addition, a modest advance in bone age was observed, probably secondary to the hyperinsulinemia and/or adrenal hyperandrogenism. Copyright © 2009 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - Context: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have twice the risk for metabolic syndrome (MetS) compared to women from the general population. Mothers and sisters of affected women also have an increased prevalence of MetS. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of MetS in fathers and brothers of women with PCOS compared to men from the general population. Design and Setting: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study at academic medical centers. Participant(s): A total of 211 fathers and 58 brothers of women with PCOS were studied and compared to 1153 and 582 Third National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES III) men of similar age and race/ethnicity, respectively. Main Outcome Measure(s): We measured MetS prevalence. Result(s): The prevalence of MetS was increased in fathers (42 vs. 32%; P = 0.006) and brothers (22 vs. 9%; P = 0.001) compared to NHANES III men. Fathers and brothers had higher body mass index (BMI) than NHANES III men (P<0.0001). MetS rates were similar in fathers and brothers compared to NHANES III groups after adjusting for BMI. Total testosterone was inversely related to MetS in both fathers and brothers, but this relationship was also accounted for by the higher BMI in male relatives. Conclusion(s): Male relatives of women with PCOS had increased prevalence rates of MetS and obesity compared to the general U.S. male population from NHANES III. In contrast to women with PCOS and their female relatives, the higher prevalence of MetS in male relatives was accounted for by elevated BMI. These findings suggest that the high rates of MetS in male relatives of women with PCOS are related to higher rates of obesity than the general population. Copyright © 2009 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - Purpose: The goal of this study was focused on two subjects. First, to determine possible association between PCOS and family history of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, heart attack, thrombosis, diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Second, to evaluate maternal and paternal transmission in PCOS patients with positive family history of a disease. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted in 549 infertile women (273 with PCOS and 276 controls) in Arash hospital of Tehran, Iran, between 2007 and 2008 by using questionnaire. Result(s): In this analysis, there were significantly increased number of women with the positive family history of diabetes among PCOS group (28.21% vs. 19.20%, p=0.01). Meanwhile, four women in PCOS group had self history of diabetes while no one in the control group reported diabetes. A statistically significant positive family history of breast cancer was found among the control group (4.35% vs. 1.30%, p=0.02). Endometrial cancer and diabetes were observed in mother or mother's side of the family but heart attack and thrombosis manifested in father or father's side of the family more. There were no statistically significant differences in a positive individual or family history of ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, heart attack, thrombosis and CVD between the two groups. Conclusion(s): In the present study, women and their relatives with PCOS had an increased prevalence of diabetes and it is more common in mother's side of the family. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Concept: Ovaries meeting criteria for polycystic ovary morphology during peak reproductive years may no longer meet the criteria with age. Objective(s): Ovarian volume and follicle number decrease with age in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), permitting age-dependent criteria for PCOM. Design and Setting: We conducted longitudinal (7-15 year interval) and cross-sectional studies to examine polycystic ovarian morphology over time at an outpatient clinic and pathology laboratory in a tertiary care hospital. Patient(s): Subjects included those with PCOS defined by the National Institutes of Health criteria (n = 11 and 483 for longitudinal and cross-sectional, respectively) and control women with regular menstrual cycles and no hyperandrogenism (n = 15 and 367), age 18-64 yr. Intervention(s): Subjects underwent an ovarian ultrasound by a single observer. Main Outcome Measure(s): Ovarian volume and follicle number were measured and ultrasound findings confirmed by a pathologist in a subset (n = 9). Result(s): Ovarian volume (15.2 +/- 7.4 vs. 7.1 +/- 3.7 ml; P < 0.01) and follicle number (12.8 +/- 3.2 vs. 8.1 +/- 3.9; P < 0.05) decreased longitudinally in PCOS and control women (volume 11.6 +/- 4.4 vs. 5.4 +/- 2.2 ml and follicle number 8.3 +/- 1.9 vs. 6.3 +/- 1.8; both P < 0.005). Using cross-sectional data, log ovarian volume and follicle number decreased in both groups, but the decrease in log ovarian volume was less pronounced in women with PCOS than in controls (P < 0.01). A combination of age, log ovarian volume, follicle number, and testosterone distinguished PCOS subjects from controls with a receiver operator characteristic curve area of 0.90. Conclusion(s): Ovarian volume and follicle number decrease with age in women with PCOS and controls necessitating age-based criteria to define polycystic ovarian morphology. It is possible to use these criteria to distinguish PCOS in women over age 40 yr. Copyright © 2009 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - Context: A significant proportion of the first-degree female relatives of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may be at risk for developing PCOS. However, it is not known at which stage of pubertal development the hormonal and metabolic abnormalities ensue in PCOS. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to assess the reproductive and metabolic profiles of daughters of women with PCOS (PCOSd) during the peripubertal period, a stage during which the gonadal axis is activated and PCOS may become clinically manifest. Design(s): Ninety-nine PCOSd [30 prepubertal and 69 pubertal (Tanner II-V)] and 84 daughters of control women (Cd) (20 prepubertal and 64 pubertal) were studied. An oral glucose tolerance test, a GnRH agonist test (leuprolide acetate, 10 mug/kg sc), and a transabdominal ultrasound were performed. Gonadotropins, sex steroids, SHBG, glucose, insulin, and lipids were determined. Result(s): Both groups had similar chronological ages and body mass index SD scores according to Tanner stage distribution. Ovarian volume and 2-h insulin were significantly higher in PCOSd compared to Cd at all Tanner stages. In Tanner stages IV and V, basal testosterone and poststimulated LH, testosterone, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations were significantly higher in PCOSd compared to Cd. Conclusion(s): Hyperinsulinemia and an increased ovarian volume are present in PCOSd before the onset of puberty and persist during pubertal development. The biochemical abnormalities of PCOS appear during late puberty. Considering the early onset and the nature of the alterations, PCOSd constitute a high-risk group for metabolic and reproductive derangements. Copyright © 2009 by The Endocrine Society.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: About one third of overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have either impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) by the age of 30. We sought to determine if overweight Hispanic adolescents with PCOS are more likely to be insulin resistant and glucose intolerant than those without PCOS. METHOD(S): A retrospective chart review of 101 subjects with PCOS and 40 without PCOS was conducted. Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI), and fasting glucose/insulin ratio (FGIR) values were calculated by using fasting glucose and insulin levels. Insulin resistance (IR) was defined as a fasting insulin level of >15 muU/mL, a 2-hour insulin level of >75 muU/mL, a HOMA-IR value of >3.16, a QUICKI value of <0.357, and/or a FGIR value of <7. RESULT(S): Of the 101 overweight subjects with PCOS (BMI: 33.2 +/- 5.9 kg/m2), 4 had IGT and 2 had DM versus none of the 40 subjects without PCOS (BMI: 32.4 +/- 5.3 kg/m 2). IR was more frequent in the overweight PCOS than in the overweight non-PCOS group (QUICKI: 68.4% vs 14.3%, P = .014) and FGIR (47.4% vs 0%, P = .024). Of the 6 subjects with glucose intolerance, only the QUICKI value was abnormal in all. CONCLUSION(S): This retrospective study demonstrated that overweight Hispanic adolescents with PCOS had more IR, IGT and DM than their non-PCOS counterparts. As the QUICKI Index was abnormal in all subjects with IGT and DM, we suggest its use as the first step in deciding which overweight Hispanic adolescents with PCOS should be further tested with an OGTT.

N2  - The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of menstrual and reproductive variables, breastfeeding, exogenous hormones, and gynecological conditions on endometrial cancer risk. We conducted a case-control study in Italy, including 454 women with endometrial cancer and 908 hospital controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariate logistic regression models. Endometrial cancer risk was inversely associated with age at menarche (OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.5-1.0, for >=14 vs. <12 years), and directly associated with age at menopause (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1-2.7, for >=55 vs. <50 years) and years of menstruation (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.7-3.4, for highest vs. lowest tertile). Multiparity strongly reduced the risk among women under 60 years of age (OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.2-0.6, for >=3 deliveries vs. <2). Oral contraceptive use conferred a 40% reduced risk (95% CI = 0.4-1.0), irrespective of time since cessation. Although based on small numbers, women with a history of treated infertility (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.1-6.4) or endometriosis (OR = 4.0, 95% CI = 1.0-15.5) were at increased risks. No significant associations with endometrial cancer risk emerged for age at first/last birth, breastfeeding, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, and history of uterine fibromyomas or polycystic ovary. In conclusion, this study confirms the importance of multiparity, years of menstruation, and oral contraceptive use in endometrial cancer etiology, thus contributing to identify women at elevated risk of such neoplasm. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine-metabolic disorder with strong familial aggregation. It has been demonstrated that parents and brothers of PCOS women exhibit insulin resistance and related metabolic defects. However, metabolic phenotypes in sons of PCOS women have not been described. Objective(s): Our objective was to assess the metabolic profiles in sons of women with PCOS during different stages of life: early infancy, childhood, and adulthood. Design(s): Eighty sons of women with PCOS (PCOSS) and 56 sons of control women without hyperandrogenism (CS), matched for age, were studied. In early infancy, glucose and insulin were determined in the basal sample. In children and adults, a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test was performed with measurements of glucose and insulin. Adiponectin, leptin, C-reactive protein, SHBG, and serum lipids were determined in the basal sample during the three periods. Result(s): During early infancy, PCOSS showed higher weight (P = 0.038) and weight SD score (P = 0.031) than CS. During childhood, weight (P = 0.003), body mass index (BMI) (P < 0.001), BMI SD score (P < 0.001), waist circumference (P = 0.001), total cholesterol (P = 0.007), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.022) were higher in PCOSS compared with CS, but after adjusting for BMI, these differences were nonsignificant. During adulthood, PCOSS exhibited higher weight (P = 0.022), BMI (P = 0.046), and waist circumference (P = 0.028) than CS. Fasting insulin (P = 0.030), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (P = 0.034), total cholesterol (P = 0.043), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.034), and 2-h insulin (P = 0.006) were also significantly higher and insulin sensitivity index composite significantly lower in PCOSS than in CS (P = 0.003). After adjusting for BMI, only 2-h insulin and insulin sensitivity index composite remained significantly different. Conclusion(s): This study indicates that sons of PCOS women exhibit higher body weight from early infancy. In addition, insulin resistance became evident as the subjects got older, which may place them at risk for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

N2  - Objective: The objective was to determine the prevalence and metabolic parameters of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in southern China. Study design: The study was observational with a parallel study. Participants were studied in a medical examination center. A population of 915 women of reproductive age was investigated at the time of their annual physical examination to determine the prevalence of PCOS in unselected women from southern China. Result(s): Our results demonstrated a 2.2% (20/915) prevalence of PCOS. Women with PCOS had higher levels of luteinizing hormone and higher luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone ratios than those in the other groups. Women with PCOS had higher fasting insulin levels and lower fasting glucose/fasting insulin ratios than women in any of the other groups. Conclusion(s): Some clinical and biochemical characteristics were apparent in PCOS patients in our population, and ethnic differences may be considered when studying the clinical and metabolic features of PCOS in China. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - The FTO (Fat mass and obesity associated) locus has recently been associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in humans. To understand the role of the FTO gene in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) we genotyped single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1421085 (C/T) in women with PCOS (n = 207) and controls (n = 100) from a Central European population. The homozygous C/C genotype showed increased prevalence in PCOS patients either obese or with metabolic syndrome (MetS) compared to lean PCOS patients or controls (27.6%, 38.9%, 22.3%, and 16.3%, respectively). In logistic regression, this genotype strongly associated with MetS (P < 0.0001, OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.8-5.7) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) with P < 0.0007, OR 7.7, 95% CI 2.1-28.6, independently of BMI or age, and to AUCgluc during OGTT (P < 0.0001, alpha = 0.99), indicating an influential role of the FTO gene in the glucose intolerance component of MetS. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The aim of this study was to establish the frequency of gene CYP17 promoter polymorphism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) from a Chilean population and to examine the association of this polymorphism with body weight and estimate of insulin resistance in PCOS patient carriers and noncarriers of the A2 allelic variant. A total of 159 women with clinical and hormonal evidence of PCOS and 93 healthy women (HW) were evaluated. Diagnosis of PCOS was made according to the National Institutes of Health consensus criteria. In PCOS and HW, an oral glucose tolerance test was performed; and serum glucose and insulin were measured before the glucose load and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after. Lipid profile and free fatty acid concentrations were determined in the basal sample. Insulin resistance was evaluated by homeostatic model assessment and insulin sensitivity index composite. A polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed in all women to determine the A2 allele of the gene CYP17 promoter. The genotype frequency was similar between HW and PCOS women. No differences in anthropometric measurements and metabolic parameters were observed in HW carrier and noncarrier of the A2 variant. In PCOS women, an increase in body mass index, waist circumference, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and fasting insulin according to the A2 allele dosage was observed (P = .008, P = .016, P = .012, and P = .006, respectively). Polycystic ovary syndrome patient carriers of the A2 allele with a body mass index greater than 29.9 kg/m2 showed an odds ratio of 9.1 (confidence interval, 3.0-27.4; P < .0001) for developing insulin resistance. These data suggest that the frequency of the A2 allele is similar between PCOS patients and HW; however, the presence of this gene defect in PCOS patients seems to be associated with increase in body weight, abdominal adiposity, and metabolic components. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE - Hyperandrogenemia, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia demonstrate familial aggregation in the female first-degree relatives of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), suggesting that these defects are heritable. Hyperandrogenemia also appears to be the male reproductive phenotype. We performed this study to test the hypothesis that brothers of women with PCOS have metabolic defects similar to those of their proband sisters. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - This was a prospective case-control study performed at four academic medical centers in the U.S. Fasting blood was obtained from 196 non-Hispanic white brothers of women with PCOS and 169 control men of age, BMI, and ethnicity comparable to those of brothers. A separate analysis was performed by study site to assess potential regional variations in metabolic parameters. RESULTS - Overall, brothers of women with PCOS had significantly higher total (P = 0.001) and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.01) as well as triglyceride levels (P = 0.01) compared with control men, although there were regional variations in these differences. There were significant positive correlations between brothers and their sisters with PCOS for total (p = 0.2, P = 0.009) and LDL cholesterol (p = 0.3, P = 0.001) and triglyceride (p = 0.2, P = 0.05) levels. Brothers also had significantly higher fasting insulin levels and homeostatic index of insulin resistance (P = 0.02 for both comparisons) compared with control men. CONCLUSIONS - Brothers of women with PCOS have dyslipidemia as well as evidence for insulin resistance similar to that of their proband sisters with PCOS. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that some metabolic abnormalities in PCOS are heritable and are not sex specific. © 2008 by the American Diabetes Association.

N2  - Objective: To assess the value of ovarian volume and follicle number in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in a Chinese population. Method(s): This study included 432 women with PCOS selected using the National Institutes of Health criteria, who were compared with 153 age-matched women as controls. All participants were given a transvaginal or transrectal ultrasound scan during day 3-5 of the menstrual cycle (for regularly menstruating women) or randomly (for oligomenorrheic or amenorrheic women). The ovarian volume (calculated using the simplified formula: 0.5 x length x height x width) and follicle number were obtained and the best diagnostic cut-off values were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristics (ROC)-curve analysis. Result(s): The 10 th and 90th centiles of ovarian volume in PCOS patients were 4.89 and 15.79 cm3, respectively, and the median was 9.21 cm3; the 10th and 90th centiles of follicle number were 8 and 19, respectively, and the median was 12. The 10th and 90th centiles of ovarian volume in controls were 2.43 and 7.75 cm3, respectively, and the median was 4.46 cm3; the 10th and 90th centiles of follicle number were 3 and 10, respectively, and the median was 6. The differences in ovarian volume and follicle number between patients and controls were statistically significant. The areas under the ROC curves for mean ovarian volume (MOV), maximum ovarian volume (MaxOV), mean follicle number (MFN) and maximum follicle number (MaxFN) to diagnose PCOS were 0.898, 0.882, 0.909 and 0.911, respectively. Setting the threshold for MOV at 6.4 cm3 (sensitivity 81%, specificity 85.6%), the threshold for MaxOV at 7.9 cm3 (sensitivity 78%, specificity 85.6%), the threshold for MFN at 10 (sensitivity 85.2%, specificity 88.8%) and the threshold for MaxFN at 12 (sensitivity 85.2%, specificity 92.6%) obtained the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity, based on the Youden index. Conclusion(s): We conclude that ovarian volume and follicle number have satisfactory power for use in the diagnosis of PCOS. Cut-offs of 6.4 cm 3, 7.9 cm3, 10 and 12, for MOV, MaxOV, MFN and MaxFN, respectively, obtained the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of PCOS in Chinese women.

N2  - Background: This study revisited the ovarian volume (OV) as one of the diagnostic criteria for Chinese adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unknown whether the threshold of 10 cm3 for the OV, chosen at the PCOS international consensus in 2003, was optimal for Chinese PCOS adolescents or not. Method(s): 69 adolescent PCOS patients and 26 controls were involved in this study. Ultrasound examination was performed between cycle days 2 and 7 or at random with a 6-MHz transvaginal transducer. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis was mainly used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Mean OV and maximum OV were significantly larger in PCOS group than that in controls. The area under the ROC curve was >0.8 for both criteria, indicating a satisfactory diagnostic potency. The two criteria had no statistical difference in diagnostic potency. Setting the threshold of mean OV at 6.74 cm3 offered the best compromise between specificity (92.3%) and sensitivity (75.4%) and setting the threshold of maximum OV at 7.82 cm3 offered the best compromise between specificity (88.5%) and sensitivity (73.9%). Conclusion(s): OV yields good diagnostic accuracy to distinguish normal ovaries from polycystic ovaries in Chinese adolescents, but for Chinese PCOS adolescents, the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity was obtained with a threshold set at 6.74 cm3 for mean ovarian volume and at 7.82 cm3 for maximum ovarian volume instead of the 10 cm3 threshold proposed by the Rotterdam consensus conference based on general PCOS patients. © 2008 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

N2  - Objective: Hyperandrogenia and insulin resistance are heritable family traits, likely to cluster in children of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) mothers. Design(s): We performed a case control study of PCOS children (n = 32) compared with children from control women (n = 38) for reproductive and metabolic abnormalities, stratifying results by three Tanner stage groupings. The children underwent history and physical examinations, a 3-h timed urine collection, a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test, and abdominal ultrasound examination (females only). Serum was obtained in older children (age > 8 yr) who consented. Result(s): Urine LH levels were significantly lower in the Tanner IV-V PCOS girls compared with controls (P = 0.04). Urine testosterone levels were significantly elevated in Tanner II-III PCOS boys compared with controls (P = 0.007). There were no significant differences in dehydroepiandrosterone levels. We validated the correlation between salivary and serum levels of insulin (insulin areas under the curve) in an adult population [n = 30, Pearson correlation coefficient (r) = 0.67; P < 0.0001], which also replicated in the children (2-h insulin r = 0.57; P = 0.0004). Mean area under the curve salivary insulin levels were significantly higher in the Tanner IV-V PCOS girls in the later stages of puberty when compared with controls (3625 +/- 1372 vs. 1766 +/- 621 min x muU/ml, 95% confidence interval 475-3242; P < 0.02). Conclusion(s): Hyperinsulinism may be a familial characteristic of PCOS children (or at least girls) but does not appear until the later stages of puberty. Other reproductive abnormalities that characterize PCOS may develop later. Copyright © 2008 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - Context: Insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes are common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been linked to metabolic dysfunction. We studied women with and without PCOS to determine the extent to which OSA is responsible for insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in PCOS. Method(s): In a prospective design, 52 women with PCOS and 21 women without PCOS of similar age and body mass index had an overnight polysomnogram and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Result(s): Twenty-nine women (56%) with PCOS had OSA compared with four controls (19%) (adjusted odds ratio 7.1;95% confidence interval, 1.7-45.7; P = 0.01). PCOS women with OSA were more insulin resistant than those without OSA [homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index 5.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.5 +/- 0.4; P = 0.006] after controlling for age, body mass index, and ethnicity. Impaired glucose tolerance was found in 16 of 29 (55%) PCOS women with OSA and only six of 23 (26%) of those without OSA (unadjusted P = 0.049). Insulin resistance and glucose intolerance were highly correlated with the presence and severity of OSA. Among PCOS women with normal glucose tolerance, the presence of OSA was associated with a nearly 2-fold higher fasting insulin level and HOMA index. The severity of OSA wa a highly significant predictor of the fasting concentrations of glucose and insulin as well as the 2-h glucose concentration and HOMA index. Conclusion(s): OSA is a highly prevalent and important determinant of insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and type 2 diabetes in PCOS. Copyright © 2008 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy of uncertain etiology but with strong evidence for a genetic contribution. Objective(s): The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that the typical polycystic ovarian morphology is a marker of inherited biochemical features in families of women with PCOS. Design(s): A study of probands with PCOS and their sisters. Patient(s): Patients included 125 probands and 214 sisters. All probands had PCOS, defined by symptoms of anovulation and/or hyperandrogenism with polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. Affected sisters were defined by polycystic ovaries, regardless of symptoms, and unaffected sisters defined by normal ovarian morphology. Setting(s): This was a clinic-based study. Main Outcome Measure(s): Clinical, endocrine, and metabolic features in the various groups were compared, and estimates of broad-sense heritability were obtained using the quantitative transmission disequilibrium test. Result(s): Although affected sisters had fewer symptoms than probands (30% had no symptoms of PCOS), serum testosterone, androstenedione, LH, and fasting insulin and insulin sensitivity were similar in the two groups with polycystic ovaries but significantly different from those in unaffected sisters or controls. We observed moderate to high heritabilities for all traits studied in affected sister pairs, whereas heritabilities calculated from discordant siblings were substantially lower. Conclusion(s): These data provide further evidence for a genetic basis of PCOS. The high heritability of biochemical features in probands and affected sisters, despite wide variation in symptoms, shows that not only are these biochemical traits strongly influenced by genetic factors but also, importantly, that polycystic ovarian morphology is an index of inherited traits in families with PCOS.

N2  - Context: An important proportion of male members of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) families exhibit insulin resistance and related metabolic defects. However, the reproductive phenotypes in first-degree male relatives of PCOS women have been described less often. Objective(s): The objective of the study was to evaluate the pituitary-testicular function in sons of women with PCOS during different stages of life: early infancy, childhood, and adulthood. Design(s): Eighty sons of women with PCOS (PCOSS) and 56 sons of control women without hyperandrogenism (CS), matched for age, were studied. In all subjects, the pituitary-gonadal axis was evaluated by a GnRH agonist test (leuprolide acetate, 10 mug/kg sc). Serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B were used as Sertoli cell markers. Serum concentrations of gonadotropins, steroid hormones, and SHBG were also determined. A semen analysis was performed. Result(s): Basal concentrations of gonadotropins, sex steroids, and inhibin B were comparable between PCOSs and CS during early infancy, childhood, and adulthood. Similar results in stimulated gonadotropin and sex steroid concentrations were observed. However, AMH serum concentrations were higher in PCOSs compared with CS during early infancy [925.0 (457.3-1401.7) vs. 685.6 (417.9-1313.2) pmol/liter, P = 0.039] and childhood [616.3 (304.6-1136.9) vs. 416.5 (206.7- 801.2) pmol/ liter, P = 0.007). Sperm-count analysis was similar between both groups. Conclusion(s): AMH concentrations are increased in prepubertal sons of women with PCOS, suggesting that these boys may show an increased Sertoli cell number or function during infancy and childhood. However, this does not seem to have a major deleterious effect on sperm production. Copyright © 2008 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - In most of South Asia, prevalences and phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) among women in the community are unknown. The authors aimed to estimate prevalence and phenotype in a community setting in Sri Lanka and to test a valid, feasible screening approach to early diagnosis. A community-based, cross-sectional study was carried out in 2005-2006. A random sample of 3,030 women aged 15-39 years was selected by cluster sampling proportionate to population size. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was utilized to screen for "probable cases" of PCOS based on menstrual history and clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism. Selected "probable cases" underwent clinical, biochemical, and ovarian ultrasound assessment. The response rate was 96.2% (n = 2,915). A total of 220 (7.5%) "probable cases" were identified: 209 women with oligo/amenorrhea (95%) and 11 women with hirsutism (5%). Further evaluation of the 220 probable cases confirmed 164 newly diagnosed cases of PCOS based on the 2003 Rotterdam diagnostic criteria. With 19 previously diagnosed cases already present, total prevalence was 6.3% (95% confidence interval: 5.9, 6.8). Of the women with "oligo/amenorrhea and/or hirsutism," 91.1% were confirmed to have PCOS; 99.4% of women with "regular cycles in the absence of clinical hyperandrogenism" were confirmed as normal. The most common phenotypes of PCOS were oligo/amenorrhea and polycystic ovaries (91.4%) and oligo/amenorrhea and hirsutism (48.3%). © The Author 2008.

N2  - Background: Studies have suggested that the Calpain-10 gene polymorphisms may play a role in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) susceptibility. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible association between three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the calpain-10 gene (UCSNPs -43, -19, and -63) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in Chilean women. Method(s): Fifty women with PCOS (28.8 +/- 8.2 y) and 70 healthy women (28.6 +/- 8.6 y) were included in this study. Serum lipids, hormonal status, fasting glucose, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin, HOMAIR, and uric acid levels were determined by conventional methods. The calpain-10 gene variants were detected by PCR and PCR-RFLP, respectively. Result(s): The presence of uncommon allele (A) for the UCSNP-43 was associated with increased risk of PCOS (odds ratio = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.11-3.34). The UCSNP-63 (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.59-2.11) and UCSNP-19 (OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.55-1.57) were not associated to PCOS. However, the PCOS women carrying the CC genotype for UCSNP-63 exhibited higher values of total cholesterol and LDL-C (P < 0.05). Similarly, control women carrying the CC genotype showed higher serum levels of triglycerides, HDL-C and uric acid (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest the contribution of CAPN10 UCSNP-43 gene polymorphism to PCOS in Chilean women. However, further studies with larger samples are necessary to confirm this observation. © 2008.

N2  - Hyperandrogenemia and insulin resistance are heritable traits in sisters of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Hyperandrogenemia also appears to be the male reproductive phenotype; however, it is less clear whether male relatives are at risk for the metabolic disorders associated with PCOS. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that brothers of women with PCOS have defects in insulin action and/or secretion. Twenty-three non-Hispanic white brothers of women with PCOS and 23 non-Hispanic white control men of comparable age matched for body mass index underwent a modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Parameters of insulin sensitivity and secretion were determined using minimal-model Bergman protocol. Disposition index was significantly decreased (2540 [1080, 3172] vs 2901 [2096, 4487], P = .009) independent of a family history of diabetes mellitus, and glucose effectiveness was significantly increased (2.4 [1.9, 2.7] vs 2.0 [1.8, 2.2], P = .02) in brothers compared with control men. We conclude that brothers of women with PCOS have evidence for pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and may be at increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Brothers of women with polycystic ovary syndrome are characterised by impaired glucose tolerance, reduced insulin sensitivity and related metabolic defects

N2  - Aims/hypothesis: Since it has been shown that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is highly inherited and characterised by insulin resistance, we hypothesised that male siblings of PCOS women would also be insulin resistant. Thus, our aim was to assess insulin sensitivity and metabolic parameters in brothers of women with PCOS and male control individuals. Method(s): Seventeen brothers of PCOS women and 28 male control volunteers were assessed with 75 g OGTTs and euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamps. PCOS index women were identified using criteria developed at the 1990 National Institutes of Health conference. Result(s): Brothers and control individuals were similar in terms of BMI, waist circumference, percentage body fat and BP. However, brothers had increased triacylglycerol (p=0.02), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1; p=0.02), factor VIII (p=0.02), 2 h glucose (p<0.001), AUCglucose (p<0.001) and AUCinsulin (p<0.001). Insulin sensitivity was reduced by 38% in brothers (p<0.001), and this was primarily due to a 65% decrease in insulin-stimulated non-oxidative carbohydrate metabolism (p<0.001). These differences remained significant after adjustment for age and BMI, except for triacylglycerol, PAI-1 and fasting glucose. The main findings also persisted after excluding individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetic siblings. Significant interactions with BMI status were found for sex hormone-binding globulin, androstenedione, PAI-1 and AUC insulin, which were significantly altered only in obese brothers (vs control individuals). Conclusions/interpretation: Brothers of PCOS women are characterised by decreased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, as well as hypercoagulability, independently of obesity. Therefore, brothers of PCOS women may have inherited the insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome typical of PCOS. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Objective: To assess the glucose intolerance and the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in the first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Clinical study of the female FDRs of patients with PCOS. Setting(s): Outpatients at endocrinology department of a university hospital. Patient(s): Seventy FDRs of PCOS patients and 20 healthy women were evaluated. Intervention(s): Basal hormonal investigations, buserelin test, and 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed. Main Outcome Measure(s): Basal hormone levels were measured. Additionally, insulinogenic index, glucose and insulin responses to OGTT, and FSH, LH, E2, and 17-OHP responses to buserelin test were obtained. Result(s): Four (5.7%) of the FDRs showed impaired glucose tolerance, and the FDRs had significantly higher fasting plasma glucose (P<.05) and basal insulin (P<.01) than control subjects. Peak and area-under-the-curve (AUC) insulin (P<.001) and AUC glucose (P<.05) responses to OGTT were also significantly higher in the FDRs than in control subjects. The FDRs showed higher insulinogenic index than the control subjects (P<.001). The FDRs had significantly (P<.05) higher LH and DHEAS levels and lower (P<.005) 17-OHP levels than the control subjects. Peak (P<.05) and AUC (P<.01) LH responses to buserelin testing were lower in the FDRs than in the control subjects while peak (P<.05) and AUC (P<.01) E2 responses to buserelin were higher in the FDRs than in the control subjects. Conclusion(s): These data support the hypothesis that FDRs of PCOS patients may have insulin resistance and the HPG axis is more susceptible than in control subjects. The FDRs also have an increased prevalence of hyperandrogenism and high DHEAS levels compared with the background population. © 2007 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

T1  - Polycystic ovary syndrome: A follow-up study on diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and malignancy 15-25 years after ovarian wedge resection
A1  - Lunde O.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - The aim of the present study was to examine the occurrence of possibly associated diseases in 149 women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) 15-25 years after ovarian wedge resection. Diabetes mellitus was the only associated disease which showed a significantly increased occurrence. No significant change in cancers specific for the female gender was seen. Likewise, the relative risk of cardiovascular disease was not affected. However, the power of the statistical test was low. This long-term study indicates increased risk of diabetes mellitus in PCOS patients. The study group is too small to give any conclusions about other possibly associated diseases. Family histories, however, revealed that associated diseases are related to genetic disposition rather than to PCOS per se. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Background: One of the main criteria to establish a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is hyperandrogenemia. Recent observations suggest that total testosterone may not be a sensitive marker for the detection of androgen excess. The aim of the present study was to compare the value of different androgen determinations for diagnosis of PCOS. Method(s): Untreated PCOS patients (n=133; mean age 28 years) and healthy control women (n=54; mean age 28 years) were included in the study. Measurements of total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), androstendione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and albumin were performed. In addition, the free androgen index (FAI), free and bioavailable testosterone were calculated. Clinical signs of hyperandrogenism were evaluated by physical examination. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) was used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of different androgen determinations to detect PCOS, defined as clinical hyperandrogenism and irregular cycles compatible with the National Institutes of Health criteria of chronic anovulation and clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism. Result(s): All biochemical parameters of hyperandrogenism were significantly higher in PCOS patients than in controls (all p<0.0001). The highest AUC-ROC was found for bioavailable testosterone (0.852) followed by FAI (0.847) and free testosterone (0.837). Lower AUC-ROC was found for SHBG, total testosterone and androstendione (0.765, 0.799 and 0.706, respectively). When FAI=4.97 was taken as a cutoff value, sensitivity was 71.4% and specificity was 85.2%. A cutoff of 0.78 nmol/L for bioavailable testosterone had even higher sensitivity of 75.9%, but slightly lower specificity of 83.3%. FAI and bioavailable testosterone correlated significantly (all p<0.05) with total testosterone, androstendione, LH/FSH ratio and DHEAS. In addition, free testosterone, bioavailable testosterone and FAI correlated significantly with hirsutism scores, and ovarian volume and follicle count. Conclusion(s): ROC analysis provided evidence that calculated testosterone indices (bioavailable testosterone, FAI, free testosterone) are useful parameters for the discrimination of PCOS patients and healthy controls. © 2007 by Walter de Gruyter.

N2  - Context: We have previously observed increased anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in prepubertal daughters of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women, suggesting that these girls may have an altered follicular development. However, it is not known whether AMH levels remain increased during puberty. Objective(s): The aim was to establish whether the increased AMH levels observed in prepubertal daughters of PCOS women persist during the peripubertal period, a stage during which the gonadal axis is activated and PCOS may become clinically manifested. Design(s): We studied 28 daughters (8-16 yr old) of PCOS women (PCOSd) and 33 daughters (8-16 yr old) of control women (Cd). In both groups, an oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Gonadotropins, sex hormones, and AMH were determined in a fasting sample. Result(s): Both groups were comparable in age, body mass index, and breast Tanner stage. Free androgen index, testosterone, AMH (Cd 14.4 +/- 8.0 pM vs. PCOSd 24.0 +/- 19.0 pM; P = 0.012), and 2-h insulin levels were significantly higher in the PCOSd group compared with the control group. The average ovarian volume was significantly higher in the PCOSd group. In both groups a positive correlation between 2-h insulin and AMH concentrations was observed (PCOSd: r = 0.530, P = 0.007; Cd: r = 0.561, P = 0.008). Conclusion(s): AMH concentrations are increased in peripubertal PCOSd. These findings, along with the results of our previous study, suggest that PCOSd appear to show an increased follicular mass that is established during early development, and persists during puberty.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a familial endocrine-metabolic dysfunction, increasingly recognized in adolescent girls with hyperandrogenism. However, it is difficult to establish whether the metabolic abnormalities described in PCOS are present before the onset of hyperandrogenism. In children, a strong association of adiponectin levels with metabolic parameters of insulin resistance has been described. Objective(s): The objective of the study was to evaluate adiponectin serum concentrations and metabolic parameters in prepubertal and pubertal daughters of women with PCOS to identify girls with increased metabolic risk. Design(s): Fifty-three prepubertal and 22 pubertal (Tanner stages II-V) daughters of PCOS women (PCOSd) and 32 prepubertal and 17 pubertal daughters of control women (Cd) were studied. In both groups, an oral glucose tolerance test was performed with measurement of glucose and insulin. Adiponectin, leptin, C-reactive protein, SHBG, sex steroids, and lipids were determined in the fasting sample. Result(s): Both groups had similar chronological ages, body mass index SD score, and Tanner stage distribution. In the prepubertal girls, 2-h insulin was higher (P = 0.023) and adiponectin levels were lower (P = 0.004) in the PCOSd group, compared with the Cd group. In the pubertal girls, triglycerides (P = 0.03), 2-h insulin (P = 0.01), and serum testosterone concentrations were higher (P = 0.012) and SHBG lower (P = 0.009) in PCOSd, compared with Cd, but adiponectin levels were similar in both groups. Conclusion(s): Some of the metabolic features of PCOS are present in daughters of PCOS women before the onset of hyperandrogenism. Adiponectin appears to be one of the early markers of metabolic derangement in these girls. Copyright © 2007 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - Background: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are assumed to be at increased risk of endometrial cancer (EC), albeit of a more differentiated type with better prognosis than in normal women. This study was designed to test these assumptions, as evidence for them is lacking. Method(s): The prevalence of polycystic ovaries (PCO), as a marker of PCOS, was investigated in ovarian sections from 128 women with EC and 83 with benign gynaecological conditions. The expression of the prognostic markers p53, Ki67, Bcl2 and cyclin D1 was also investigated by immunohistochemistry in endometrial tumours from 11 women with PCO and 16 with normal ovaries. Result(s): Overall, PCO were similarly prevalent in women with EC (8.6%) and benign controls (8.4%); however, in women aged <50 years, PCO were more prevalent in women with EC (62.5 versus 27.3%, P = 0.033). Cyclin D1-expressing endometrial tumours tended to be more prevalent in women with PCO compared to normal ovaries (36.4 versus 6.25%, respectively, P = 0.071). Bcl2-, p53- and Ki67-expressing tumours were similarly prevalent. Conclusion(s): The association between PCOS and EC appears confined to premenopausal women. The tendency for cyclin D1-expressing endometrial tumours to be more prevalent in women with PCO challenges the assumption that EC prognosis is improved in women with PCOS. © 2006 Oxford University Press.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Background: This study revisited the ovarian volume (OV) as a diagnostic criterion for polycystic ovaries (PCO). Indeed, a threshold of 10 cm3 for the OV, chosen at the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) international consensus held at Rotterdam in 2003, was to date not based on appropriate studies such as receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Method(s): This prospective study included 154 women with PCOS, selected by using the former National Institutes of Health criteria, who were compared with 57 women with normal ovarian function. Ultrasound examination was performed between cycle days 2 and 7 with a 7 MHz transvaginal transducer. Result(s): Mean OV, ovarian area (OA) and follicle number (FN) values were significantly higher in the PCOS group than in controls. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was >0.9 for all three criteria, indicating a satisfactory diagnostic potency for each. Concerning the OV, setting the threshold at 7 cm3 offered the best compromise between specificity (91.2%) and sensitivity (67.5%). In comparison, specificity and sensitivity were 98.2 and 45%, respectively, with a threshold at 10 cm3. Nevertheless, the highest AUC was obtained for FN (0.956) and then for OA (0.941). Conclusion(s): OV is a good diagnostic criterion for PCO but, on the basis of the present data, we propose to lower its threshold to 7 cm3. The FN >12 still appears as the best diagnostic criterion. The OA could be used as a surrogate for OV in difficult situations. © The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.

N2  - Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate insulin resistance (IR), glucose tolerance status and cardiovascular risk factors in first degree relatives of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): A total of 120 family members [MothersPCOS (n = 40), FathersPCOS (n = 38), SistersPCOS (n = 25) and BrothersPCOS (n = 17)] of 55 patients with PCOS and 75 unrelated healthy control subjects without a family history of diabetes or PCOS (four age- and weight-matched subgroups, i.e. ControlMothers, ControlFathers, ControlSisters and ControlBrothers) were studied. IR was assessed by homeostatic model assessment (HOMA IR), log HOMA, insulin sensivity index (ISI), the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) and area under the curve for insulin during the oral glucose tolerance test (AUCI, AUCG) in with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) subjects and controls. Serum adiponectin, resistin, homocysteine and lipid levels were measured. Result(s): The prevalence of any degree of glucose intolerance was 40% in MothersPCOS and 52% in FathersPCOS. In total, six (15%) glucose tolerance disorders were identified in the ControlMothers and ControlFathers in first degree relatives of control subjects. The first degree relatives of PCOS patients had significantly higher serum fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, Log HOMA and AUCI levels in all subgroups than the control subjects. The control subjects had significantly elevated QUCKI, ISI levels and serum adiponectin levels compared to the first degree relatives of PCOS subjects in all subgroups. The serum Hcy and resistin levels increased significantly in both FathersPCOS and MothersPCOS groups but not BrothersPCOS and SisterPCOS. Conclusion(s): The results of the present study support the finding that the first degree relatives of PCOS patients carry an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, as do PCOS patients. © The Author 2005.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with menstrual and reproductive abnormalities, insulin resistance, and obesity. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of diagnosed PCOS and its association with cardiovascular risk factors. Setting(s): The study is set in an integrated health care delivery system in northern California. Patient(s): A total of 11,035 women with PCOS were identified by one or more outpatient diagnoses of PCOS using health plan databases. An age-matched sample of women without PCOS was also selected. Outcome Measures: Prevalence of PCOS and targeted cardiovascular risk factors [hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and body mass index (BMI)] were measured. Result(s): During 2002-2004, the prevalence of diagnosed PCOS among female members aged 25-34 yr was 2.6% (95% confidence interval 1.6-1.7%). Women with diagnosed PCOS were more likely than those without PCOS to be obese [BMI >= 30 mg/m2; odds ratio (OR) 4.21, 3.96-4.47]. Furthermore, PCOS was associated with diabetes (OR 2.45, confidence interval 2.16-2.79), hypertension (OR 1.41, 1.31-1.51) and known dyslipidemia (OR 1.53, 1.39-1.68), even after adjusting for BMI and known confounders. Among women with PCOS, compared with whites, Blacks and Hispanics were more likely and Asians less likely to be obese; Asians and Hispanics were more likely to have diabetes; and Blacks were more likely and Hispanics less likely to have hypertension. Conclusion(s): Within a large, community-based population receiving health care, diagnosed PCOS was highly prevalent and associated with a much higher frequency of cardiovascular risk factors that varied by race/ethnicity. Our prevalence estimates likely underestimate the true prevalence of PCOS. Further studies are needed to explore racial/ethnic differences and the extent to which PCOS contributes to future cardiovascular risk. Copyright © 2006 by The Endocrine Society.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Context: We determined the relationship of metabolic syndrome (MBS) to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Objective(s): We tested the hypothesis that parental MBS is related to the PCOS phenotype in their offspring. Design/Setting: We phenotyped for MBS and PCOS in our General Clinical Research Center. Patient(s): Girls with PCOS, 12-19 yr old (n = 36, including one pair of siblings), and their parents (35 mothers, 19 fathers) were recruited from the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic. Healthy girls, 12-19 yr old (n = 21), were recruited as a reference population. Intervention(s): We measured anthropometrics, blood pressure, fasting lipids and androgens, oral glucose tolerance, and ultrasonographically determined polycystic ovary status. Main Outcome Measure(s): MBS in parents, and PCOS features in mothers, were related to the presence of PCOS features in probands. Result(s): Fathers had strikingly high prevalence of excess adiposity (94% were obese or overweight) and MBS (79%). Premenopausal mothers more commonly had MBS (36%) than features of PCOS (<=22%). Polycystic ovaries in proband offspring of premenopausal mothers were associated with maternal polycystic ovaries only in a minority of cases. Proband polycystic ovary status was completely concordant to fathers' MBS status (P = 0.008), but not their own or their mothers' MBS status, in families whose premenopausal mothers lacked polycystic ovaries. Proband prevalence of MBS was 27.8%, 3-fold greater than expected for obesity status. Conclusion(s): Familial factors related to paternal MBS seem to be fundamental to the pathogenesis of PCOS.

N2  - We performed this study to access the changes in glucose tolerance over time in a group of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (n = 71) and control women (n = 23) with regular menstrual cycles and baseline normal glucose tolerance. Mean follow-up was between 2 and 3 yr for both groups (PCOS 2.5 +/- 1.7 yr; controls 2.9 +/- 2.1 yr). Based on World Health Organization glucose tolerance categories, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of glucose intolerance at follow-up in the PCOS group. In the PCOS group, 25 (37%) had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and seven (10%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline, compared with 30 (45%) and 10 (15%), respectively, at follow-up. There were also no differences within groups (PCOS or control) or between groups (PCOS vs. control) in the oral glucose tolerance test-derived measure of insulin sensitivity, but in the women with PCOS who converted to either IGT or type 2 diabetes mellitus, there was a significant decrease (P < 0.0001). At the follow-up visit, the mean glycohemoglobin level was 6.1 +/- 0.9% in women with PCOS vs. 5.3+/-0.7% in the control women (P<0.001). Women with PCOS and baseline IGT had a low conversion risk of 6% to type 2 diabetes over approximately 3 yr, or 2% per year. The effect of PCOS, given normal glucose tolerance (NGT) at baseline, is more pronounced with 16% conversion to IGT per year. Our study supports that women with PCOS (especially with NGT) should be periodically rescreened for diabetes due to worsening glucose intolerance over time, but this interval may be over several years and not annually.

N2  - Objective: To study diagnostic thresholds for polycystic ovary (PCO). Design(s): Retrospective cohort study. Setting(s): Academic hospital. Patient(s): Normoandrogenic ovulatory women and patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Intervention(s): Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) transvaginal ultrasound. Main Outcome Measure(s): The mean follicle number per ovary (FNPO) of both ovaries and the maximum number follicles in a single sonographic plane (FSSP) of either ovary were determined using 3D transvaginal ultrasound. Ovarian volume was determined using 2D transvaginal ultrasound. Result(s): Twenty-nine normoandrogenic ovulatory women were compared with 10 patients with PCOS. Diagnostic thresholds for PCO with 100% specificity as determined by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were <20 for mean FNPO, <10 for maximum FSSP, and <13 cm3 for ovarian volume. Both 2D and 3D transvaginal ultrasound were highly accurate in the diagnosis of PCO as determined by areas under the curve (AUC) that were >90% for all three measures. Conclusion(s): Mean FNPO and maximum FSSP by 3D transvaginal ultrasound have comparable high accuracy for diagnosis of PCO. The diagnostic threshold with 100% specificity for mean FNPO is <20, which is greater than suggested by the Rotterdam Consensus Workshop in 2003. Use of the consensus standard, consequently, may result in overdiagnosis of PCO. A threshold of <20 mean FNPO using 3D transvaginal ultrasound may be appropriate to minimize false-positive diagnoses of PCO. ©2006 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Objective: It is well known that hyperandrogenism and insulin-resistance with or without compensatory hyperinsulinism are closely associated, but the Rotterdam Consensus has concluded that principally obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) should be evaluated for the metabolic syndrome. Our aim was to study insulin sensitivity in PCOS women with hirsutism regardless of obesity. Method(s): Clinical characteristics, sex hormones and fasting- and after OGTT-glycemia and insulinemia, homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA IR), and Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity were analyzed in 130 women with PCOS. Hirsutism has been evaluated through the Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) map scoring system. Result(s): PCOS women with hirsutism (57.7% of participants) showed significant higher values of total testosterone levels (P=0.016), free testosterone (P=0.027), DHEA sulfate (P=0.017), and DELTA4androstenedione (P=0.018). They had similar body mass index (BMI) (P=0.073) and were significantly less insulin sensitive (P=0.002) than those without hirsutism (42.3% of participants). In women with PCOS and hirsutism, there was a significant correlation between FG score and insulin-sensitivity indexes (HOMA IR, rho=0.33, P=0.005; Matsuda index, rho= -0.34, P=0.003) but not with the androgen levels. Moreover, women with hirsutism showed a significantly greater insulin (P= 0.019), C-peptide (P=0.002), and glucose (P=0.024) areas under the curve (auc2h). Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that the increased responsiveness of the pilo-sebaceous unit to androgens seems to be influenced by insulin sensitivity and that insulin resistance should be assessed in all hirsute women with PCOS regardless of their BMI, as insulin resistance was found in hirsute women irrespective of whether they were overweight or obese. © 2006 Society of the European Journal of Endocrinology.

N2  - Context: Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is produced by the granulosa cells and reflects follicular development. Adult women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have increased levels of AMH associated with an excessive number of growing follicles. However, it is not known whether these abnormalities are present before the clinical onset of PCOS. Objective(s): Our objective was to investigate whether prepubertal daughters of women with PCOS have increased AMH levels. Design(s): Fourteen female infants (2-3 months old) and 25 prepubertal girls (4-7 yr old) born to PCOS mothers were studied. As a control group, we studied 21 female infants and 24 prepubertal girls born to mothers with regular menses and without hyperandrogenism. The group with PCOS mothers and the control group had normal birth weight and were born from spontaneous singleton pregnancies. Circulating concentrations of gonadotropins, testosterone, androstenedione, estradiol, 17-OH-progesterone, SHBG, inhibin B, and AMH were determined by specific assays. Result(s): Serum concentrations of AMH were significantly higher in the PCOS group compared with the control group during early infancy (20.4 +/- 15.6 vs. 9.16 +/- 8.6 pmol/liter; P = 0.024) and during childhood (14.8 +/- 7.7 vs. 9.61 +/- 4.4 pmol/liter; P = 0.007). Gonadotropin and serum sex steroid concentrations were similar in both groups during the two study periods, except for FSH, which was lower during childhood in girls born to PCOS mothers. Conclusion(s): We conclude that serum AMH concentrations are increased in prepubertal daughters of PCOS women, suggesting that these girls appear to show evidence of an altered follicular development during infancy and childhood.

N2  - Dyslipidemia is a feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but its pathogenesis remains controversial. We performed this study of mothers of women with PCOS to test the hypothesis that dyslipidemia is a heritable trait in families of women with PCOS and to investigate the impact of age on reproductive and metabolic phenotypes. Fasting blood was obtained in 215 non-Hispanic white mothers of women with PCOS and 62 control women. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was compared with that in non-Hispanic white women of comparable age from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. Mothers had higher total (P < 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (P = 0.007), whereas high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels did not differ compared with control women. The only predictors of LDL levels in mothers were their daughters' LDL levels (r2 = 0.11, P < 0.001) and their own unbound testosterone levels (r2 = 0.04, P = 0.03). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was increased in obese (body mass index >= 30 kg/m2) mothers compared with obese non-Hispanic white women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (P = 0.04). Thirty-one percent of mothers reported a history of menstrual irregularity. These mothers had higher androgen levels, markers of insulin resistance, and LDL levels than mothers with regular menses. LDL levels are increased in mothers of women with PCOS, suggestive of a heritable trait. A history of menstrual irregularity identifies mothers with features of PCOS. Obese mothers have a very high prevalence of metabolic syndrome. These findings suggest that both the reproductive and metabolic abnormalities persist with age in PCOS. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

N2  - Purpose of investigation: The purpose of the study was to evaluate if known risk factors for endometrial cancer in menopausal women are also related to endometrial cancer in younger ages. Method(s): Eighty-one patients with a mean age of 46.3 years diagnosed with endometrial cancer (EC) (histologically confirmed) from January of 1992 to December of 2004 were included in the study. The EC group of patients was compared with 100 patients (control group) randomly selected from the gynecologic clinic (inclusion criteria: age 43-48 years) without any endometrial cancer diagnoses that were evaluated for the same factors. Result(s): Mean BMI was 34.4 kg/m2 (SD = 8.8) in the first group and 28.3 (SD = 7.6) in the second one (p < 0.001). None of the women in the EC group reported any history of oral contraception. With the exception of hypertension and ovarian cancer (probably related to small numbers) all other comparisons were statistically significant (although some only marginally). Discussion(s): From the results of our study, it seems that body mass index (BMI), parity, type of menstrual cycles, history of polycystic ovarian (PCO) syndrome and diabetes are possibly related to endometrial cancer in women younger than 50 years of age, and the strongest relation was found with increased BMI. Also, there was no increased incidence of hypertensive disease in the EC group. Conclusion(s): Prospective studies are needed for final conclusions.

N2  - Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) often develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To determine the magnitude of risk of developing T2DM among women with PCOS, development of T2DM was prospectively assessed among women who had 12DM (n = 97) and controls (n = 95) using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards modeling. The women with T2DM had higher baseline weight (body mass index, P < 0.01) and lower insulin sensitivity (homeostasis assessment model of insulin resistance, P < 0.01). The 8-year incidence rate among cases and controls was 13.4% and 5.8%, respectively (relative risk = 2.3). Obese cases had a fivefold risk of T2DM developing (P < 0.01) compared with age-adjusted obese controls, indicating significant interaction between PCOS and obesity to effect T2DM risk.

N2  - The prevalence of obesity in Thai children is increasing. These individuals are at increased risks of metabolic syndrome that includes insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), dyslipidemia and hypertension. PCOS has been known to be associated with insulin resistance. Objective(s): To compare the insulin sensitivity between obese adolescent girls with PCOS and those without PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): We reviewed demographic and hormonal data of 6 obese adolescent girls with PCOS and compared with 6 age, weight and BMI-matched non-PCOS controls. Each subject underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. Result(s): Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance score (HOMA-IR score) in obese adolescent girls with PCOS was significantly higher than in girls without PCOS with median and range as follows (16.5 [3.8, 21.8] vs. 4.1 [3.3, 6.9], p=0.04). Our study demonstrates that obese adolescent girls with PCOS have more severe insulin resistance measured by HOMA-IR score than girls without PCOS independent of the degree of obesity. Since insulin resistance is a metabolic precursor of future cardiovascular diseases, obese adolescent girls with PCOS might be at greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease in later adulthood than their non-PCOS counterparts.

N2  - Objective: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) carry a number of cardiovascular risk factors and are considered to be at increased risk for atherosclerosis. Elevated concentrations of advanced glycation end-products (AGE), which exert their effects through interaction with specific receptors (RAGE), have been implicated in the cellular and tissue damage during atherosclerotic processes. Design/patients: We investigated serum AGE levels in 29 young women with PCOS as well as the expression of their receptor, RAGE, in circulating monocytes and compared them levels with 22 healthy control women. Measurements/results: Women with PCOS had higher levels of serum AGE proteins compared to healthy individuals (9.81 +/- 0.16 vs. 5.11 +/- 0.16, P < 0.0001), and increased RAGE expression was observed in monocytes of PCOS women compared to controls (30.91 +/- 10.11 vs. 7.97 +/- 2.61, P < 0.02). A positive correlation was observed between AGE proteins and testosterone (T) levels (r = 0.73, P < 0.0001). The correlation between AGE proteins and T levels remained high (partial correlation coefficient = 0.61, P = 0.0001) after controlling for body mass index (BMI), insulin levels and the area under the curve for glucose (AUCGLU) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). A positive correlation was also observed between AGE proteins and the free androgen index (FAI) (r = 0.58, P < 0.0001), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (r = 0.31, P < 0.02), insulin (r = 0.46, P < 0.001), homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) (r = 0.47, P < 0.0001), AUCGLU (r = 0.52, P < 0.002) and RAGE (r = 0.59, P < 0.01). A negative correlation was observed between AGE proteins and glucose/insulin ratio (GLU/INS) (r = -0.35, P < 0.01), and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (r = -0.50, P < 0.01). In multiple regression analysis T was the only independent predictor of AGE levels (P < 0.0001, b = 0.044) between BMI, insulin, SHBG and AUCGLU (adjusted R2 = 0.59, F = 44.41, P < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): These data clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that PCOS women without overt hyperglycaemia have increased AGE levels and elevated RAGE expression when compared with controls.

N2  - Aim. This study was designed to examine the relationship between the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) gene and insulin resistance (IR) in first-degree relatives of subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Materials and methods. One hundred and twenty family members of 55 patients with PCOS and 80 unrelated healthy control subjects without a family history of diabetes or PCOS were studied. IR was assessed by homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) and area under the curve (AUC) for insulin during an oral glucose tolerance test in subjects with normal glucose tolerance and controls. Genetic analysis of the PPAR-gamma gene Pro12Ala polymorphism was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results. Fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and AUC insulin were significantly higher in first-degree relatives of PCOS subjects than in controls. A significantly different allele distribution of the Pro12Ala polymorphism of PPAR-gamma was observed between the two groups, with the frequency of the variant Ala isoform being significantly reduced in the first-degree relatives of PCOS subjects (10.8%, 13 subjects) compared with the control group (22.5%, 18 subjects). All Pro12Ala polymorphisms of the PPAR-gamma gene were heterozygous. Compared with first-degree relatives of PCOS subjects with the Pro12Pro polymorphism of PPAR-gamma, first-degree relatives of PCOS subjects with the Pro12A1a polymorphism had low fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and AUC insulin levels. The combined prevalence rate for impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose and diabetes was 40% (16 subjects) in mothers and 52% (20 subjects) in fathers of PCOS women. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that Pro12A1a PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism may be protective against IR and might prevent the development of diabetes mellitus in the first-degree relatives of subjects with PCOS. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Context: Dyslipidemia is a feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but its pathogenesis remains controversial. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that dyslipidemia is a heritable trait in sisters of women with PCOS. Design(s): A case-control design was used. Setting(s): The study took place at General Clinical Research Centers in four academic medical centers in the United States. Patient(s): The subjects included 385 sisters of women with PCOS with the following reproductive phenotypes: sisters with PCOS (n = 51), sisters with hyperandrogenemia and regular menses (HA) (n = 38), unaffected sisters (n = 143), and unknown phenotypes (n = 153). One hundred twenty-five control women of comparable age, body mass index, and ethnicity to women with PCOS were included. Intervention(s): Fasting blood was obtained for measurements of lipid profile, reproductive hormones, glucose, and insulin levels. Main Outcome Measure(s): The main outcome measures included lipid and lipoprotein levels and prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Result(s): Sisters with PCOS and HA phenotypes had higher total (P <= 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P <= 0.01) compared with unaffected sisters and control women. Triglyceride levels were elevated only in sisters with the PCOS phenotype (P < 0.05). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was increased in sisters with the PCOS (n = 29) and HA(n = 17) phenotypes compared with unaffected sisters (n = 85) (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Conclusion(s): Low-density lipoprotein levels are increased in affected sisters of women with PCOS consistent with a heritable trait. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is increased in affected sisters. Copyright © 2005 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Insulin resistance also plays a role in the metabolic syndrome (MBS). We hypothesized that the MBS is prevalent in PCOS and that women with both conditions would present with more hyperandrogenism and menstrual cycle irregularity than women with PCOS only. We conducted a retrospective chart review of all women with PCOS seen over a 3-yr period at an endocrinology clinic. Of the 161 PCOS cases reviewed, 106 met the inclusion criteria. The women were divided into two groups: 1) women with PCOS and the MBS (n = 46); and 2) women with PCOS lacking the MBS (n = 60). Prevalence of the MBS was 43%, nearly 2-fold higher than that reported for age-matched women in the general population. Women with PCOS had persistently higher prevalence rates of the MBS than women in the general population, regardless of matched age and body mass indes ranges. Acanthosis nigricans was more frequent in women with PCOS and the MBS. Women with PCOS and the MBS had significantly higher levels of serum free testosterone (F = 0.002) and lower levels of serum SHBG (F = 0.001) than women with PCOS without the MBS. No differences in total testosterone were observed between the groups. We conclude that the MBS and its components are common in women with PCOS, placing them at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Women with PCOS and the MBS differ from their counterparts lacking the MBS in terms of increased hyperandrogenemia, lower serum SHBG, and higher prevalence of acanthosis nigricans, all features that may reflect more severe insulin resistance.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single dose of leuprolide acetate on gonadotrophin and gonadal steroid secretion in brothers of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), in order to assess P450c17alpha activity. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a lipid proffle were also performed. Method(s): Twenty-two unrelated brothers of women with PCOS (PCOSb) and 14 brothers of normal cycling women (Cb), matched for age, underwent a leuprolide acetate test (10 mug/kg s.c.) and an OGTT with measurement of circulating concentrations of gonadotrophins, steroid hormones, glucose, insulin and lipids. Result(s): Clinical and basal hormonal parameters were similar in both groups. After leuprolide administration, PCOSb exhibited a significant increase of 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) compared to Cb (P < 0.05). However, only 45% of PCOSb showed a supranormal increase of 17-OHP (2 SD above the respective control group mean values, P < 0.003) with a normal gonadotrophin response (group 1). The other 55% of the PCOSb exhibited a normal 17-OHP response to the analogue (group 2). However, in group 2, basal steroid concentrations did not show a uniform pattern: six of the PCOSb exhibited high basal androstenedione (2 SD above the respective control group mean values), three were very similar to Cb, and the other three presented lower basal testosterone concentrations (2 SD below the respective control group mean values) than those observed in Cb. Conclusion(s): This study shows that different responses to leuprolide in PCOS brothers make evident the heterogeneity of this syndrome in which P450c17alpha activity could be involved. © European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to compare the pregnancy outcome, especially the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), in a group of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), with a group of healthy weight-matched women. Method(s): Retrospectively, we evaluated the pregnancies of 66 women with PCOS, who had been treated for infertility and who delivered at our department. These were compared with a group of 66 age- and weight-matched controls. Result(s): We did not find any significant differences in the prevalence of pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and premature deliveries between the group of PCOS patients and the controls. Conclusion(s): When differences in age and weight between PCOS patients and controls are negligible, PCOS is not associated with a higher risk of pregnancy complications.

N2  - Insulin action is mediated by two insulin receptor (BR) isoforms, differing in mitogenic and metabolic function. IR isoform expression might occur in human granulosa cells and could be altered in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) from hyperinsulinemia. To determine the relationship between granulosa cell IR isoform expression and follicular fluid insulin concentration in individual follicles, 18 normal women and seven PCOS patients receiving gonadotropins for in vitro fertilization were studied. Glucose tolerance testing was performed before pituitary desensitization, and fasting serum insulin was measured at oocyte retrieval. Granulosa cells and fluid aspirated from the first follicle were used to determine IR isoform mRNA expression and insulin concentration, respectively. IR isoform A mRNA expression was greater than that of IR isoform B expression in normal mural granulosa and cumulus cells, without a cell type effect. Intrafollicular insulin levels increased with adiposity and serum insulin levels at oocyte-retrieval but did not predict IR mRNA expression. Total IR mRNA expression, but not intrafollicular insulin levels, was elevated in PCOS patients, whereas intrafollicular insulin levels were increased in women with impaired glucose tolerance. Granulosa cell IR heterogeneity, together with adiposity-dependent intrafollicular insulin availability, introduces a novel mechanism by which insulin may affect granulosa cell function within the follicle.

N2  - The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), characterized by chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism, has many features of metabolic syndrome and can be considered a metabolic disease. Approximately 50% of patients with PCOS are overweight or obese with abdominal fat accumulation. Some metabolic alterations and abdominal fat distribution have also been reported in lean women with PCOS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect, if any, of obesity on metabolic features, body composition and fat distribution in patients with PCOS. Body composition and abdominal fat distribution (evaluated by DEXA), waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose tolerance and homeostasis model assessment index were determined in 23 lean [mean age 23+/-5 yr, mean body mass index (BMI) 22+/-2 kg/m2] and 27 overweight-obese (mean age 21+/-5 yr, mean BMI 32+/-5 kg/m2) patients with PCOS and in 20 age- and weight-matched eumenorrhoic women. Patients exhibited slight but non-significant differences in metabolic parameters, waist circumference, blood pressure and total and abdominal fat content compared with weight-matched controls. None of the lean subjects suffered from metabolic syndrome according to the National Cholesterol Education Program - Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATPIII) criteria as opposed to 10 overweight-obese patients and three overweight-obese control subjects (37% and 33.3% of each subgroup, respectively). Our data do not show significant metabolic alterations in lean PCOS women. Results indicate that obesity seems to underpin the metabolic alterations exhibited by the overweight-obese patients. However, since women with PCOS are at increased cardiovascular risk, further studies are needed to evaluate metabolic alterations and body composition in these patients. © 2004, Editrice Kurtis.

N2  - This study was performed to determine whether phenotypically healthy sisters of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have evidence of insulin resistance. We studied 54 women: 17 with PCOS, 17 sisters of these probands and 20 control women with similar age, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). The PCOS sisters had neither clinical nor laboratory evidence of hyperandrogenism. However, estimated insulin resistance indices indicated decreased insulin sensitivity in PCOS sisters compared with the controls. No difference of insulin resistance indices was detected between the PCOS and their sisters. This finding provides additional evidence that there is a hereditary trait regarding insulin resistance in the PCOS families. © 2004, Editrice Kurtis.

N2  - Objective We evaluated metabolic parameters in Chilean women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who were carriers and non-carriers of the glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 972 (Gly972Arg) variant of insulin receptor substrate-1 and to assess insulin response after oral high- and low-glycemic loads Methods In 146 women with PCOS and 97 healthy women (HW), Gly972Arg genotypes were obtained by polymerase chain reaction, and an oral glucose tolerance test was performed with glucose and insulin measurements. An insulinogenic index, a homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, and whole-body insulin sensitivity index (composite) were calculated. Eight carriers and eight non-carriers (four PCOS and four HW, respectively) underwent a 50-g glucose (high glycemic) or 50-g fructose (low glycemic) load with serum glucose and insulin measurements at 15-min intervals for 3 h. Results The frequency of the Gly972Arg variant was higher in PCOS patients than in HW (P < 0.05). The insulinogenic index was lower in HW carriers than in non-carriers (P < 0.05). In PCOS carriers, 2-h insulin was higher than in those without the mutation. In overweight PCOS carriers, the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance was higher and the insulin sensitivity index was lower than in PCOS patients without the mutation. In HW carriers, a delay in the maximal response of insulin secretion was observed, with a decrease of 26.7% in insulin concentrations 30 to 60 min after the 50-g glucose load. Glucose concentrations increased by 19.7% between 60 and 120 min. Glucose concentrations between 0 and 120 min were 14.9% higher in PCOS carriers than in non-carriers after the 50-g glucose load. Conclusions In HW, this polymorphism appears to be associated with a decrease in insulin secretion; in PCOS women, this polymorphism interacts with obesity to influence insulin resistance, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of the metabolic component of PCOS. © Elsevier Inc. 2004.

N2  - Notwithstanding the potential public health impact of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), estimates regarding its prevalence are limited and unclear. Between July 1998 and October 1999, 400 unselected consecutive premenopausal women (18-45 yr of age) seeking a preemployment physical at the University of Alabama at Birmingham were studied (223 Black, 166 White, and 11 of other races). Evaluation included a history and physical examination, a modified Ferriman Gallwey hirsutism score, and serum screening for hyperandrogenemia, hyperprolactinemia, and 21-hydroxylase-deficient nonclassical adrenal hyperplasia. PCOS was diagnosed by the presence of the following: 1) oligoovulation, 2) hyperandrogenemia and/or hirsutism (modified Ferriman-Gallwey score >= 6), and 3) the exclusion of related disorders. Confirmed PCOS was established in those individuals whose evaluation was complete and indicative of PCOS, and possible PCOS was established when the hormonal evaluation was not complete or was unavailable, but the clinical phenotype was otherwise suggestive of the disorder. The individual probability of PCOS in women with possible PCOS was assigned a weight based on the findings in similar subjects whose evaluation was complete, and the total number of PCOS cases arising from these individuals was calculated (i.e. individual probability of PCOS x total number of subjects in the group). The cumulative prevalence of PCOS in our population was 6.6% (26.5 of 400), including 15 subjects among the 347 women completing their evaluation and a calculated prevalence of 11.5 subjects among the remainder. The prevalence rates of PCOS for Black and White women were 8.0 and 4.8%, respectively, not significantly different. These data from a large representative unselected population support the concept that PCOS is the most common endocrine abnormality of reproductive-aged women in the United States.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance (IR), increased risk of glucose intolerance, and type 2 diabetes. Family studies have indicated a genetic susceptibility to PCOS. The aims of this study were 1) to assess glucose tolerance status, gonadotropins, and androgens in first degree relatives of patients with PCOS; and 2) to assess IR in normal glucose tolerant (NGT) family members. One hundred two family members of 52 patients with PCOS [MothersPCOS (n = 34; mean age, 46.5 yr; mean body mass index (BMI), 28.8 kg/m2), FathersPCOS (n = 24; mean age, 50.4 yr; mean BMI, 27.5 kg/m2), SistersPCOS (n = 19; mean age, 25.1 yr; mean BMI, 22.9 kg/m2), and BrothersPCOS (n = 25; mean age, 23.7 yr; mean BMI, 22.5 kg/m2)] and 82 unrelated healthy control subjects without a family history of diabetes or PCOS (4 age- and weight-matched subgroups, i.e. ControlMothersPCOS, ControlFathersPCOS, ControlSistersPCOS, and ControlBrothersPCOS) were studied. Glucose and insulin (at baseline and during a 75-g, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test) were measured. IR was assessed by fasting insulin (FI), fasting glucose to insulin ratio (FGI), homeostatic model assessment (HOMA IR), and area under the curve for insulin during the oral glucose tolerance test (AUCinsulin) in NGT MothersPCOS, FathersPCOS, SistersPCOS, BrothersPCOS, and matched control subgroups. Including the prestudy-diagnosed 3 mothers and 2 fathers with diabetes, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were noted in 16% and 30% of MothersPCOS and 27% and 31% of FathersPCOS, respectively. There was no diabetes in SistersPCOS and BrothersPCOS. IGT was found in 5% of SistersPCOS. Impaired fasting glucose was found in 3% of MothersPCOS and 4% of BrothersPCOS. The analysis of NGT family members showed that MothersPCOS had higher FI (P < 0.05), HOMA IR (P < 0.05), and AUCinsulin (P < 0.01) and lower FGI (P < 0.05) than ControlMothersPCOS, whereas all IR parameters were comparable between FathersPCOS and their matched control subgroup. SistersPCOS had higher FI (P < 0.05), HOMA IR (P < 0.01), and AUCinsulin (P < 0.05) and lower FGI (P < 0.01), and BrothersPCOS had higher AUCinsulin (P < 0.01) than their matched control subgroups, respectively. MothersPCOS had higher testosterone levels than ControlMothersPCOS (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 for pre- and post-menopausal women, respectively). SistersPCOS had higher LH (P < 0.01), testosterone (P < 0.001), androstenedione (P < 0.01), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P < 0.05) levels than ControlSistersPCOS. There was no difference in gonadotropin and androgen levels in FathersPCOS compared with ControlFathersPCOS or in BrothersPCOS compared with ControlBrothersPCOS. Our results suggest that 1) first degree relatives of patients with PCOS may be at high risk for diabetes and glucose intolerance; 2) NGT female family members have insulin resistance; and 3) mothers and sisters of PCOS patients have higher androgen levels than control subjects. We propose that the high risks of these impairments warrant screening in first degree relatives of patients with PCOS.

N2  - Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are insulin resistant secondary to a postbinding defect in insulin signaling. Sequential euglycemic glucose clamp studies at 40 and 400 mU.m-2.min-1 insulin doses with serial skeletal muscle biopsies were performed in PCOS and age-, weight-, and ethnicity-matched control women. Steady-state insulin levels did not differ, but insulin-mediated glucose disposal was significantly decreased in PCOS women (P < 0.05). Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3K) activity was significantly decreased in PCOS (n = 12) compared with control skeletal muscle (n = 8; P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the abundance of IR, IRS-1, or the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3K in PCOS (n = 14) compared with control (n = 12) muscle. The abundance of IRS-2 was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in PCOS skeletal muscle, suggesting a compensatory change. We conclude that there is a physiologically relevant defect in insulin receptor signaling in PCOS that is independent of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

N2  - The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease and the risk factors for these diseases in perimenopausal women with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) treatment. A group of 28 women was selected from a large group of patients who had undergone wedge ovarian resection. A total of 752 controls was selected by age (45-59 years) from a random female population sample. There was no difference between the two groups in body mass index, waist circumference or waist-hip ratio. Both groups were found to have identical family histories of NIDDM, hypertension, and coronary artery disease and identical smoking habits. We did not find a difference between the mean concentrations of lipids and fasting glucose. The two groups did not differ in the proportions of women with elevated lipid concentrations. The prevalence of NIDDM and coronary artery disease was significantly higher in PCOS women. In conclusion, women in the general population have the same level of risk factors at perimenopausal age as PCOS women. Patients with markedly expressed clinical symptoms of PCOS made up a subgroup in the general population at high risk for developing NIDDM and coronary artery disease.

N2  - Endometrial cancers are generally divided into at least two different pathogenetic types. One occurs from the proliferative endometrium, depending on continuous estrogen stimulation, while the other is not related to the stimulation and occurs from the atrophic endometrium of older post-menopausal women. In order to assess the risk factors for endometrial carcinoma (EC), a case-control study with 136 Japanese women having EC and with 376 healthy controls for ECs in Japan, together with an immunohistochemical analyses on p53, estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) of EC patients was undertaken. Nulliparity, increased BMI, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, later age at menopause and personal cancer history were all seen predominantly in the EC group. Frequency of irregular menses, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and obesity in the EC patients under 40-year old was significantly higher than the control group. Immunohistochemical expressions of ER (P<0.05) and PR (P<0. 01) were more frequently recognized in the EC of the pre-menopausal than in the post-menopausal patients. On the other hand, p53 overexpression was detected in 27.2% of the post-menopausal EC group, while only found in 7.1% of the pre-menopausal EC group. These findings indicate that possible factors related to endometrial carcinogenesis are different between the pre- and post-menopausal EC patients. Namely, untreated ovarian dysfunction such as PCOS with unopposed estrogenic action in the endometrium may be associated with development and growth of EC in younger women, yet abnormality of p53 gene may be more concerned with the development of the post-menopausal EC, independently of sex steroid influence.

N2  - Aims/hypothesis. Insulin resistance with increased risk of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes is a common feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). To investigate antecedents of metabolic disorders in family members of patients with PCOS, we evaluated glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in parents of patients with PCOS compared to parents of healthy women. Methods. A total of 200 parents of women with clinical and hormonal evidence of PCOS (PCOSp) and 120 parents of healthy normally cycling women (HWp) were studied. A 75-g OGGT was performed and subjects were classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (1999). Serum glucose and insulin were measured before the glucose load and 30, 60 and 120 min after. C-peptide and sex hormone-binding globulin were also determined before the glucose load. Insulin resistance was assessed by HOMA model and ISI composite. Results. The prevalence of Type II diabetes was 1.89-(1.06-3.38)-fold higher in PCOSp compared to HWp. Insulin resistance, evaluated by HOMAIR and ISI composite was also significantly higher in the PCOSp group compared to the HWp group. After both study groups were distributed by sex, and adjusted by age and BMI, the metabolic parameters were still significantly different between PCOSp and HWp. Conclusions/interpretation. The data suggest that parents of PCOS women exhibit insulin resistance and Type II diabetes more frequently than those of healthy women, thus constituting a high-risk group but an ideal cohort to detect and prevent the development of Type II diabetes.

N2  - Objective: We have used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine the diagnostic performance of several serum parameters, in order to evaluate their potential usefulness in establishing the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in epidemiological studies. Design(s): Prospective study. Method(s): One hundred and fourteen women reporting spontaneously for blood donation were included in the study. Menopausal and oral contraceptive-treated women were excluded. Serum samples were obtained at the moment of donation, independently of fasting, time of day or day of menstrual cycle. Measurements included total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), LH, FSH and estradiol. The free testosterone (FT) concentration and the free androgen index (FAI) were calculated from testosterone and SHBG levels. ROC curves were calculated for all these serum determinations. Result(s): Eight patients were diagnosed with PCOS, according to the presence of oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, acne and/or hyperandrogenemia, and exclusion of non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hypothyroidism and hyperprolactinemia. Of the parameters studied SHBG, FAI, FT and DHEAS were considered adequate measures for the diagnosis of PCOS. For example, serum SHBG levels showed an area under the ROC curve of 0.875+/-(S.E.w)0.045 (95% confidence interval 0.800-0.929). A SHBG decision threshold <37 nmol/l had a sensitivity of 87.5%, a specificity of 86.8%, a positive likelihood ratio of 6.63, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.14, for the diagnosis of PCOS. Conclusion(s): Our present results strongly suggest that decreased SHBG levels, and increased FAI, free testosterone concentration and DHEAS concentrations, are highly effective as single analytical procedures in epidemiological studies for the detection of PCOS in women of reproductive age.

N2  - We aimed to estimate the likely prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in indigenous Australian women in a cross-sectional survey based on structured interviews. In the Kimberley region of Western Australia and south-western Victoria, between February and June 1999, women over the age of 18 available for interview and willing to participate were included. Menstrual status, anthropometric measures, fasting blood biochemistry and hirsutism were assessed. A total of 38 premenopausal women completed the survey. Of these, 50% had regular menstrual cycles of normal duration and no hirsutism; seven had oligomenorrhea and hirsutism/hyperandrogenemia; and of the nine women with hirsutism and regular menses, three had hyperandrogenemia. Thus, possibly ten women fulfilled the criteria of PCOS. This unique data set suggests a high prevalence of PCOS in indigenous Australian women. Further research to document this formally is warranted, in view of the potential adverse effects of PCOS on reproduction and metabolism.

N2  - This study was performed to determine whether the sisters of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have evidence for insulin resistance. Three hundred and thirty-six women with PCOS, 307 sisters of these probands, and 47 control women were studied. The sisters were grouped by phenotypes: PCOS [hyperandrogenemia (HA) with chronic oligo- or amenorrhea, n = 39], HA with regular menses (n = 36), unaffected (UA; n = 122), and unknown (n = 110). The analyses were adjusted for age and body mass index. PCOS and HA sisters of women with PCOS had similar and significantly elevated fasting insulin levels (P = 0.001) as well as similar and significantly decreased fasting glucose/insulin ratios (P < 0.001) suggestive of insulin resistance compared with UA sisters and control women. Markers of insulin resistance were associated with hyperandrogenemia and not with menstrual irregularity. PCOS sisters also had decreased levels of SHBG (P = 0.02) suggestive of higher ambient insulin levels. PCOS sisters had increased levels of proinsulin (P = 0.04) compared with control women, which suggested pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction in this group of sisters. The magnitude of obesity also differed significantly among the groups of sisters. The PCOS sisters were significantly more obese than all the other groups, and the HA sisters were more obese than the UA sisters. We conclude that markers of insulin resistance are associated with hyperandrogenemia rather than menstrual irregularity in the sisters of women with PCOS. Menstrual irregularity may be related to the magnitude of insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion or to other factors associated with obesity.

N2  - There is an inherited susceptibility to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Some investigators have suggested that premature male-pattern balding is a male phenotype in PCOS families, but this remains controversial. We recently reported evidence for an autosomal monogenic abnormality in ovarian and adrenal steroidogenesis in the sisters of women with PCOS. We performed this study to determine whether we could identify a clinical or biochemical phenotype in the brothers of women with PCOS. One hundred nineteen brothers of 87 unrelated women with PCOS and 68 weight- and ethnicity-comparable unrelated control men were examined and had fasting blood samples obtained. The odds of balding (Hamilton score >= V) did not differ in the brothers of PCOS women compared with control men. Brothers of women with PCOS had significantly elevated dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels [brothers 3035 +/- 1132 ng/ml (mean +/- SD) vs. control men 2494 +/- 1172 ng/ml; P < 0.05]. There was a significant positive linear relationship between DHEAS levels in PCOS probands and their brothers (r = 0.35; P = 0.001). There was no significant bimodal distribution in DHEAS levels, and there were no significant differences in other parameters in brothers of PCOS women with high DHEAS levels compared with those with low DHEAS levels. There is familial clustering of elevated DHEAS levels in the brothers of women with PCOS, suggesting that this is a genetic trait. This might reflect the same underlying defect in steroidogenesis that we found in the sisters of women with PCOS. Balding was not increased in the brothers of women with PCOS. We conclude that there is a biochemical reproductive endocrine phenotype in men in PCOS families.

N2  - BACKGROUND. This study used the clinicopathologic profiles of Japanese women younger than 50 years of age with endometrial carcinoma to distinguish the clinicopathologic features of carcinomas of the lower uterine segment (LUS) from those of carcinomas of the corpus mucosa proper (CMP). METHODS. Eighty-eight endometrial carcinomas in women younger than 50 years old (25.3%) were selected from our file of 348 Japanese women with endometrial carcinoma. Seventy-two were classified as carcinomas of the CMP and 16 carcinomas of the LUS. A tumor was judged to be a carcinoma of the LUS when it involved a continuous area ranging from the lower corpus to the upper cervix with or without intervention of a portion of uninvolved LUS. RESULTS. The mean ages of women with carcinomas of the CMP and LUS were 41.2 and 39.0 years, respectively. In comparison to carcinomas of the LUS, carcinomas of the CMP were more strongly associated with reproductive risk factors including parity (P = 0.01) and polycystic ovary syndrome (P = 0.02). There was no significant difference in body mass index or the incidence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension between women presenting with carcinomas of the CMP and LUS. Histologically, carcinomas of the LUS more frequently showed a high-grade endometrioid tumor (P = 0.02) with deep myometrial invasion (P < 0.01) and were less associated with endometrial hyperplasia (P < 0.01) than those of the CMP.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder of premenopausal women, characterized by chronic hyperandrogenism, oligoanovulation, and insulin resistance. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are strongly associated with insulin resistance and hypercytokinemia, independently of obesity. We hypothesized that women with PCOS are at risk for OSA and EDS. Fifty-three women with PCOS (age range, 16-45 yr) and 452 control premenopausal women (age range, 20-42), from a general randomized sample for the assessment of prevalence of OSA, were evaluated in the sleep laboratory for 1 night. In addition, women with PCOS were tested for plasma free and weakly bound testosterone, total testosterone, and fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations. In this study, PCOS patients were 30 times more likely to suffer from sleep disordered breathing (SDB) than the controls [odds ratio = 30.6, 95% confidence interval (7.2-139.4)]. Nine of the PCOS patients (17.0%) were recommended treatment for SDB, in contrast with only 3 (0.6%) of the control group (P < 0.001). In addition, PCOS patients reported more frequent daytime sleepiness than the controls (80.4% vs. 27.0%, respectively; P < 0.001). PCOS patients who were recommended treatment for SDB, compared with those who were not, had significantly higher fasting plasma insulin levels (306.48 +/- 52.39 vs. 176.71 +/- 18.13 pmol/L, P < 0.01) and a lower glucose-to-insulin ratio (0.02 +/- 0.00 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.00, P < 0.05). Plasma free and total testosterone and fasting blood glucose concentrations were not different between the two groups of PCOS women. Our data indicate that SDB and EDS are markedly and significantly more frequent in PCOS women than in premenopausal controls. Also, insulin resistance is a stronger risk factor than is body mass index or testosterone for SDB in PCOS women. These data support our proposal that, independently of gender, sleep apnea might be a manifestation of an endocrine/metabolic abnormality in which insulin resistance plays a principal role.

N2  - Objective: To assess cardiac flow parameters in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): A prospective case-control study. Setting(s): University-based hospital.Patient(s): Thirty consecutive patients with PCOS were enrolled. Thirty women with regular menstrual cycles served as the controls.Intervention(s): Systolic and diastolic function parameters were assessed by standard two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated by a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and area-under-curve insulin analysis. Serum hormones, lipid profile, homocysteine, vitamin B12, folate, fibrinogen, uric acid, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-I concentrations were measured. Main Outcome Measure(s): Systolic and diastolic function parameters, insulin sensitivity and serum homocysteine levels. Result(s): The mean serum homocysteine and uric acid concentrations were significantly higher in the PCOS group. Patients with PCOS had significant hyperinsulinemia. All systolic function parameters were comparable between the two groups. However, patients with PCOS had significantly lower peak mitral flow velocity in early diastole and significantly lower ratio between the early and late peak mitral flow velocities and also had significantly longer isovolumic relaxation time, reflecting a trend for nonrestrictive-type diastolic dysfunction. The area-under-curve insulin correlated positively with peak mitral flow velocity in late diastole (r = 0.375). The mean cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio correlated negatively with mean mitral flow velocity in early diastole (E) peak (r = -0.474). The mean fasting insulin level correlated negatively with mean E/A ratio (r = -0.387). Conclusion(s): Diastolic dysfunction and increased serum homocysteine concentrations may contribute to increased cardiovascular disease risk in patients with PCOS.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate whether some ultrasound parameters of ovarian morphology can discriminate between control women and patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Retrospective data analysis. Setting(s): Volunteers women in an academic research environment. Patient(s): Eighty amenorrheic or oligomenorrheic women and 30 normal ovulatory control participants. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): We evaluated ovarian volume, area, stroma, and the stroma/total area (S/A) ratio by use of transvaginal pelvic ultrasound; and we assayed serum levels of gonadotropin, androgen, and estradiol during the early follicular phase (days 2 to 5) of the menstrual cycle in regularly cycling controls and on a random day in amenorrheic patients. Result(s): Patients with PCOS showed significantly higher ovarian volume, area, stroma, and mean S/A ratio when compared to multifollicular and control groups. Cut-off values have been defined for ovarian volume (13.21 mL), area (7.00 cm2), stroma (1.95 cm2), and S/A ratio (0.34). The sensitivity for PCOS diagnosis was 21%, 4%, 62%, and 100%, respectively. The S/A ratio showed the most significant correlation with the androgen levels. Conclusion(s): The evaluation of the S/A ratio can differentiate between PCOS and control or multifollicular women with both a sensitivity and a specificity of 100%. Furthermore, this ultrasound parameter is strictly related to hormonal milieu and to anthropometric characteristics. © 2001 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is considerably more common in men than women. Preliminary data suggest that androgens may play a role in the male predominance of apnea. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by menstrual disturbances, androgen excess, and frequently obesity. These features suggest that women with PCOS may be at increased risk for OSA. To determine whether obese women with PCOS have an increased prevalence of sleep apnea compared with age and weight-matched reproductively normal women, we performed overnight polysomnography for determination of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in 18 obese women with PCOS and age and weight-matched control women. Additional measurements included waist, hip, and neck circumferences, serum total testosterone, unbound testosterone, and DHEAS. Women with PCOS had a higher AHI than controls (22.5 +/- 6.0, vs. 6.7 +/- 1.0, P = 0.008). Women with PCOS were also more likely to suffer from symptomatic OSA syndrome (44.4% vs. 5.5%, P = 0.008). AHI correlated with waist-hip ratio (r = 0.51, P < 0.03), serum testosterone (r = 0.52, P < 0.03) and unbound testosterone (r = 0.50, P < 0.05) in women with PCOS. We conclude that obese women with PCOS are at increased risk of OSA when compared with matched reproductively normal women. Women with PCOS should be carefully questioned regarding symptoms of sleep apnea.

N2  - We prospectively estimated the prevalence of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as defined by the NIH/NICHHD 1990 endocrine criteria, in a population of 154 Caucasian women of reproductive age reporting spontaneously for blood donation. Anthropometric data; the presence of hirsutism, acne, and androgenic alopecia; and the menstrual history were recorded by a single investigator. In 145 women, blood samples were also obtained for measurement of serum androgen levels. PCOS was defined by the presence of 1) oligomenorrhea, 2) clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and 3) exclusion of hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disorders, and nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Hirsutism was defined by a modified Ferriman-Gallwey score of 8 or more, acne was considered as a sign of hyperandrogenism when persistent after the second decade of life, and hyperandrogenemia was defined by an increase in circulating testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate or an increase in the free androgen index above the 95th percentile of the control values derived from the nonhirsute, nonacneic women having regular menses who were not receiving hormonal therapy. PCOS was present in 10 (6.5%), hirsutism was present in 11 (7.1%), and acne was present in 19 (12.3%) of the 154 women. Our results demonstrate a 6.5% prevalence of PCOS, as defined, in a minimally biased population of Caucasian women from Spain. The polycystic ovary syndrome, hirsutism, and acne are common endocrine disorders in women.

N2  - A cohort of 786 women who received a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in the United Kingdom before 1979 was traced to investigate the long-term consequences of the syndrome. Data were obtained from death certificates for 70 women. Morbidity data were collected from general practice records and questionnaires for 319 women diagnosed with PCOS an average of 31 years previously and for 1060 age-matched control women. The proportion of women with involuntary infertility was 17.5% in the PCOS group compared with 1.3% in the control group. All-cause mortality in the cohort did not differ from that of the general population of women. Women with PCOS were not at significantly increased risk of mortality or morbidity from breast cancer but were at increased risk of endometrial cancer. Women with a history of PCOS had higher levels of several cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, raised plasma cholesterol and body mass index > 30 kg m-2. Mortality and morbidity from coronary heart disease did not differ significantly between the women with PCOS and comparison groups. Control of obesity is likely to be particularly important for women with a history of PCOS.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors but the relative prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women with PCOS has not previously been reported. We have compared cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in middle-aged women previously diagnosed with PCOS and age-matched control women. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of women diagnosed with PCOS in the United Kingdom before 1979. PATIENTS: Seventy cohort members died before 31 March 1999. Morbidity data were collected from 319 women with PCOS and 1060 age-matched control women. Sixty-one women with PCOS and 63 control women attended a clinical examination. MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected from death certificates, general practitioners' records and questionnaires with measurement of cardiovascular risk factors in a subsample of questionnaire respondents. RESULT(S): All-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the cohort were similar to women in the general population (standardized mortality ratios (95% CI): 93 (72-117) and 78 (45-124), respectively). Women with PCOS had higher levels of several cardiovascular risk factors: diabetes (P=0.002) hypertension (P=0.04), hypercholesterolaemia (P<0.001), hypertriglyceridaemia (P=0.02) and increased waist:hip ratio (P=0.004). After adjustment for BMI, odds ratios (OR) were 2.2 (0.9-5.2) for diabetes, 1.4 (0.9-2.0) for hypertension and 3.2 (1.7-6.0) for hypercholesterolaemia. A history of coronary heart disease (CHD) was not significantly more common in women with PCOS (crude OR (95%CI) 1.5 (0.7-2.9)) but the crude OR for cerebrovascular disease was 2.8 (1.1-7.1). CONCLUSION(S): At long-term follow-up, a history of nonfatal cerebrovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes are more prevalent among women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Morbidity and mortality from of coronary heart disease among women with polycystic ovary syndrome is not as high as previously predicted. This finding challenges our understanding of the aetiology of coronary heart disease in women.

N2  - Objective: To investigate, using logistic regression analysis and receiver operator characteristic analysis, the biochemical diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and if it could be improved by using an array of hormone measurements chosen to yield optimal and cost-effective discrimination between women with PCOS and healthy women. Design(s): Retrospective clinical study. Setting(s): Outpatient clinic of reproductive endocrinology at Turku University Central Hospital, Turku, Finland. Patient(s): Fifty-four oligomenorrheic women with PCOS diagnosed by ovarian ultrasonography, and 29 healthy regularly menstruating women with normal ovarian morphology. Main Outcome Measure(s): Concentrations of LH, FSH, androstenedione (At, T, and sex hormone-binding globulin in serum. Result(s): Luteinizing hormone, FSH and A, when used in combination, were the hormonal analytes of highest clinical utility. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and overall concordance of 98%, 93%, and 96%, respectively, were attained. Each of the analytes used alone yielded lower degree of discrimination. Conclusion(s): Simultaneous use of the levels of LH, FSH, and A in serum can be used effectively for classification between women with PCOS and healthy women.

N2  - In order to evaluate the acute insulin response after i.v. injection of glucagon in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), 35 women affected by PCOS and 11 normo-ovulatory controls underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and, 2 days later, a glucagon test (1 mg i.v.). Patients were analysed according to their degree of obesity; the insulin release after glucagon injection for lean PCOS subjects and control women was not statistically significantly different. Conversely obese PCOS patients had higher insulin secretion after both i.v. glucagon and OGTT when compared to the other groups. Moreover the insulin secretory patterns were heterogeneously represented in lean and obese PCOS women. When the patients were analysed according to their insulinaemic response to OGTT, normo-insulinaemic PCOS women and control subjects had a similar insulin response to i.v. glucagon whereas the hyper-insulinaemic PCOS group had a higher insulin response (P < 0.0001). Moreover, a highly significant relationship was found between the insulin response to OGTT and to glucagon administration in the PCOS population (P < 0.0001; r = 0.73), which was maintained also after controlling for obesity. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that PCOS patients could have an insulin hyper-response to glucagon administration, that is partially independent from obesity and related to their insulinaemic status. Moreover, the glucagon test could represent an effective alternative to OGTT in screening insulin disorders of PCOS patients (at least in the absence of other risk factors), due to its reliability, simplicity, and speed of performance.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and oligomenorrhea (O/M). PCOS has variable clinical phenotypes, biochemical features, and metabolic abnormalities. To determine the prevalence of PCOS in the Greek population as well as the metabolic parameters, we performed a cross-sectional study of 192 women of reproductive age (17-45 yr), living on the Greek island of Lesbos. They were divided into 4 groups according to the presence of hirsutism (defined as a Ferriman-Gallwey score >=6) and O/M: group N (n = 108), regular menses and absence of hirsutism; group 1 (n = 56), regular menses and hirsutism; group 2 (n = 10), O/M and absence of hirsutism; and group 3 (n = 18), O/M and hirsutism. Body mass index, waist to hip ratio, and mean blood pressure did not differ among the studied groups. Hormonal profile was assessed by measuring free testosterone (FT). The prevalence of PCOS, defined by the presence of O/M and biochemical hyperandrogenism (FT >=k95th percentile of the normal women), was estimated to be 6.77% (13 women of 192). Higher FT levels were observed in group 3 (O/M and hirsutism) compared with groups N (P < 0.00001) and 1 (P < 0.0001) and in groups 1 (hirsutism) and 2 (O/M) compared with group N (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.005, respectively). Sex hormone-binding globulin levels were lower in women with PCOS and in groups 1 and 3 that those in group N (P < 0.002, P < 0.02, and P < 0.002, respectively) in dependently of the body mass index. The metabolic profile was investigated by measurements of fasting glucose (FG), fasting insulin (FI), and estimation of the fasting glucose to insulin ratio (FG:I ratio). After covariance adjusted for the BMI, FI levels were higher in group 3 and in women with PCOS than in the normal (P < 0.00)5 and P < 0.002, respectively) and the hirsute (P < 0.05 and P < 0.02, respectively) women, whereas FG levels did not differ among the studied groups. The FG:I ratio was lower in group 3, group 1, and in women with PCOS than in normal women (P < 0.05). Finally, a high incidence of family history of diabetes mellitus (P = 0.001) and menstrual disorders (P = 0.01) was observed in women with PCDS, in contrast to the normal and hirsute women. In conclusion, PCOS appears to be a particularly common endocrine disorder in the Greek population under study (prevalence, 6.77%); furthermore, it is associated with certain metabolic abnormalities. These data also suggest that the severity of the fasting hyperinsulinemia is associated with the severity of the clinical phenotype of hy perandrogenism independently of obesity.

N2  - Metabolic disturbances associated with insulin resistance are present in most women with polycystic ovary syndrome. This has led to suggestions that women with polycystic ovary syndrome may be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease in later life. We undertook a long-term follow-up study to test whether cardiovascular mortality is increased in these women. A total of 786 women diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome in the United Kingdom between 1930 and 1979 were traced from hospital records and followed for an average of 30 years. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated to compare the death rates of these women with national rates. The SMR for all causes was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.69-1.17), based on 59 deaths. There were 15 deaths from circulatory disease, yielding an SMR of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.46-1.37). Of these 15 deaths, 13 were from ischemic heart disease (SMR 1.40; 95% CI, 0.75-2.40) and two were from other circulatory disease (SMR 0.23; 95% CI, 0.03-0.85). There were six deaths from diabetes mellitus as underlying or contributory cause, compared with 1.7 expected (odds ratio 3.6; 95% CI, 1.5-8.4). Breast cancer was the commonest cause of death (SMR 1.48 based on 13 deaths; 95% CI, 0.79-2.54). We conclude that women with polycystic ovary syndrome do not have markedly higher than average mortality from circulatory disease, even though the condition is strongly associated with diabetes, lipid abnormalities, and other cardiovascular risk factors. The characteristic endocrine profile of women with polycystic ovary syndrome may protect against circulatory disease in this condition.

N2  - Estimates of the prevalence of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in the general population have ranged from 2-20%. The vast majority of these reports have studied White populations in Europe, used limited definitions of the disorder, and/or used bias populations, such as those seeking medical care. To estimate the prevalence of this disorder in the United States and address these limitations, we prospectively determined the prevalence of PCOS in a reproductive-aged population of 369 consecutive women (174 White and 195 Black; aged 18-45 yr), examined at the time of their preemployment physical. Body measures were obtained, and body hair was quantified by a modified Ferriman-Gallwey (F-G) method. All exams were initially performed by 2 trained nurses, and any subject with an F-G score above 3 was reexamined by a physician, the same for all patients. Of the 369 women, 277 (75.1%) also agreed to complete a questionnaire and have additional blood drawn. Subjects were studied regardless of current estrogen/progestin hormonal use (28.5%). PCOS was defined as 1) oligoovulation, 2) clinical hyperandrogenism (i.e. hirsutism) and/or hyperandrogenemia, and 3) exclusion of other related disorders, such as hyperprolactinemia, thyroid abnormalities, and nonclassic adrenal hyperplasia. Hirsutism was defined by a F-G score of 6 or more, and hyperandrogenemia was defined as a total or free testosterone, androstenedione, and/or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate level above the 95th percentile of control values [i.e. all eumenorrheic women in the study, who had no hirsutism (F-G <=5) or ache and were receiving no hormonal therapy; n = 98]. Considering all 369 women studied, White and Black women had similar mean ages (29.4 +/- 7.1 and 31.1 +/- 7.8 yr, respectively), although White women had a lesser body mass than Black women (24.9 +/- 6.1 vs. 29.2 +/- 8.1 kg/m2, respectively; P < 0.001). Of these 7.6%, 4.6%, and 1.9% demonstrated a F-G score of 6 or more, 8 or 10, respectively, and there was no significant racial difference, with hirsutism prevalences of 8.0%, 2.8%, and 1.6% in Whites, and 7.1%, 6.1%, and 2.1% in Blacks, respectively. Of the 277 women consenting to a history and hormonal evaluation, 4.0% had PCOS as defined, 4.7% (6 of 129) of Whites and 3.4% (5 of 148) of Blacks. In conclusion, in our consecutive population of unselected women the prevalence of hirsutism varied from 2-8% depending on the chosen cut-off F-G score, with no significant difference between White and Black women. Using an F-G score of 6 or more as indicative of hirsutism, 3.4% of Blacks and 4.7% of Whites had PCOS as defined. These data suggest that PCOS may be one of most common reproductive endocrinological disorders of women.

N2  - Our preliminary family studies have suggested that some female first- degree relatives of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have hyperandrogenemia perse. It was our hypothesis that this may be a genetic trait and thus could represent a phenotype suitable for linkage analysis. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined 115 sisters of 80 probands with PCOS from unrelated families. PCOS was diagnosed by the combination of elevated serum androgen levels and <=6 menses per year with the exclusion of secondary causes. The sisters were compared with 70 healthy age- and weight-comparable control women with regular menses, no clinical evidence of hyperandrogenemia, and normal glucose tolerance. Twenty-two percent of the sisters fulfilled diagnostic criteria for PCOS. In addition, 24% of the sisters had hyperandrogenemia and regular menstrual cycles. Circulating testosterone (T) and nonsex hormone-binding globulin-bound testosterone (uT) levels in both of these groups of sisters were significantly increased compared with unaffected sisters and control women (P < 0.0001 for both T and uT). Probands, sisters with PCOS, and hyperandrogenemic sisters had elevated serum luteinizing hormone levels compared with control women. We conclude that there is familial aggregation of hyperandrogenemia (with or without oligomenorrhea) in PCOS kindreds. In affected sisters, only one-half have oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia characteristic of PCOS, whereas the remaining one-half have hyperandrogenemia per se. This familial aggregation of hyperandrogenemia in PCOS kindreds suggests that it is a genetic trait. We propose that hyperandrogenemia be used to assign affected status in linkage studies designed to identify PCOS genes.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of endometrial carcinoma in endometrial hyperplasia and try to identify those patients at greatest risk. METHOD(S): We conducted a retrospective study of 116 patients who had simple, complex or mixed (simple with focal complex) endometrial hyperplasia with or without atypia, from January 1991 to December 1994. RESULT(S): Twenty-nine patients had endometrial hyperplasia with atypia and 87 without atypia. Incidence of endometrial carcinoma was 27.6% in those with atypia; and 3.4% in those without atypia. All were stage I (A or B) adenocarcinomas. Polycystic Ovary Disease and subfertility were found significantly in the cases with cytological atypia; however, they were not significant in the cases with carcinoma. No significant historical differences that could predict carcinoma were found.

N2  - Objective. Polycystic ovary syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder associated with a moderate degree of insulin resistance and a higher risk of developing NIDDM. The exact mechanism of insulin resistance is unclear. This study examines the frequency of an Xbal polymorphism of the glycogen synthetase gene (A2 allele) as a marker of insulin resistance and seeks to relate the presence of the A2 allele to indices of insulin sensitivity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by fasting insulin measurements, as well as following oral glucose tolerance test. An i.v. insulin tolerance test was performed to measure the rate of endogenous blood glucose disposal following an i.v. bolus of insulin. Restriction fragment length polymorphism was performed with Xbal digestion of PCR amplified product to detect the presence of A1 and A2 allele. Patients. Seventy-one obese (BMI > 25.1) and 19 non-obese (BMI < 25) women with PCOS, and 62 controls (33 obese and 29 non-obese) participated in the study. Results. Obese PCOS had significantly higher fasting insulin (P = 0.002) compared to obese controls. There was no difference between non-obese PCOS and controls. Twenty per cent of obese PCOS had impaired glucose tolerance. The A1A2 genotype was detected in 16 of the 150 (10.7%) subjects examined. Of these, 11/88 (12.5%) were PCOS and 5/62 (8%) were controls. The A2A2 genotype was not present in any of the subjects. The A1A2 genotype was not detected in any of the subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. There was no significant difference in the incidence of the A1A2 genotype between PCOS and controls or between the individual groups. There was no association between the presence of the A1A2 genotype and indices of insulin sensitivity Conclusion. The Xbal polymorphism (A2 allele) of the glycogen synthetase gene was not over represented in the PCOS subject and did not relate to the indices of insulin sensitivity or glucose intolerance.

N2  - Insulin resistance has been reported to be associated with hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries. To study the prevalence of insulin resistance in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO) and the correlation between hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism, 48 patients were divided into four groups: group 1, Non-obese ovulatory women (n = 10); group 2, obese ovulatory women (n = 9); group 3, non-obese women with PCO (n = 14); group 4, obese women with PCO (n = 15). Each patient was submitted to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Glucose, insulin, androstenedione and testosterone levels were determined and the blood glucose and insulin response of women with PCO and normal women were compared. Glucose intolerance was observed in group 3 (28.6%) and group 4 (40%) but not in groups 1 or 2, and hyperinsulinemia was observed in group 2 (66.7%), group 3 (64.3%) and group 4 (86.6%). There was a correlation between androstenedione and testosterone levels and insulinemia in group 4. There was also a high prevalence of insulin resistance in patients with PCO regardless of obesity, and hyperandrogenism-aggravated insulin resistance.

N2  - Data from previous studies suggest that infertility is a risk factor for endometrial cancer. We used data from the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study to further characterize this relationship. The subject group comprised 399 women ages 20-54 with newly diagnosed epithelial endometrial cancer ascertained through six cancer registries. The control group comprised 3040 women in the same age range selected by random-digit telephone dialing from the same geographic areas where cancer patients resided. Compared with women who reported no fertility problem, women with physician-diagnosed infertility who had reported at least 2 years of infertility had an odds ratio for endometrial cancer, adjusted for age, of 1.7 (95% confidence interval 1.1-2.6). Women who reported infertility resulting from ovarian factors had an adjusted odds ratio of 4.2 (95% confidence interval 1.7-10.4). These results suggest that factors such as anovulation may explain much of the increased risk of endometrial cancer found among subgroups of infertile women.

N2  - A case-control study of 268 patients with endometrial cancer and 268 population controls was conducted during 1988-1990 in Shanghai, China, to evaluate etiologic factors in a population whose risk had not been substantially altered by the use of exogenous estrogens. In spite of this, the major risk factors resembled those found in other studies. The risk of endometrial cancer was significantly elevated among nulligravidas (OR = 5.4, 95% CI = 2.0-14.6) and decreased with number of pregnancies (p < 0.01). Late age at menopause was associated with increased risk, while early age at menarche was unrelated. Use of oral contraceptives for more than 2 years was associated with a reduction in endometrial cancer risk (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.1-1.2), while short-term use of oral contraceptives and other methods of contraception were unrelated. Obesity was a strong predictor of risk, with women in the highest quartile of weight having 2.5 times the risk of those in the lowest quartile. In contrast to many other studies, cigarette smokers were at elevated risk (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 0.9-3.0). Risk was also elevated among women reporting a history of gall-bladder disease, polycystic ovaries, menstrual symptoms, and non-estrogen hormone use.
