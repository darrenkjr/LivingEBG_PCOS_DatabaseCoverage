N2  - Purpose The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of myo-Inositol administration on oocyte quality, fertilization rate and embryo quality in patients with PCOS during assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles. Methods Fifty infertile PCOS patients were randomly designated in two groups. In the study group, patients received daily doses of 4 g myo-Inositol combined with 400 mg folic acid and in the control group patients received only 400 mg folic acid from 1 month before starting the antagonist cycle until the day of ovum pick up. Oocyte and embryo qualities were assessed according to European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) guidelines. The gene expression of PGK1, RGS2 and CDC42 as a factor of oocyte quality in granulosa cells was analyzed using real-time RT-PCR. Levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by chemiluminescence assay in follicular fluid. Results The percentage of metaphase II oocyte, fertilization rate and embryo quality significantly improved in the study group (pa<a0.05), but the number of retrieved oocytes and follicle count were not statistically different between groups. Furthermore, the gene expression of PGK1, RGS2 and CDC42 was significantly higher in the study group (pa<a0.05) but no differences were found between two groups in terms of TAC and ROS levels. Conclusions The present study findings suggest that myo-Inositol alters the gene expression in granulosa cells and improves oocyte and embryo quality among PCOS patients undergoing ART.Copyright © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2019.

N2  - Purpose The purpose is a comparison of effectiveness of myo-inositol and metformin in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) treated with letrozole. Methods This study is a randomized single-blind controlled clinical trial undertaken in 150 infertile PCOS women. For all patients, letrozole is prescribed at a dose of 7.5 mg per day from the third day of menstruation for 5 days. Patients who did not ovulate were included and divided into three pretreatment groups: group I(control group), 200 microg of folic acid (as a placebo); group II, 1500 mg of metformin daily plus 200 microg of folic acid, and group III, inositol 2 g plus 200 microg of folic acid received twice daily for 3 months. In the last cycle, 7.5 mg letrozole was prescribed for the induction of ovulation. Primary outcomes were ovary function and pregnancy. Results The ovarian function was not significantly different in those groups, whereas the ovarian function of inositol + folic acid group in normal BMI found significantly higher than other BMI spectra. In addition, the ovarian function is significantly higher in the inositol + folic acid group by increasing the infertility duration. The incidence of pregnancy is lower in letrozole + folic acid + inositol group than the other groups; however, it is not significant. Conclusion The addition of inositol and metformin to the treatment of infertile PCOS women with letrozole resistance improves the ovarian function; however, it is not significant. Of note, inositol was more effective than metformin in patients with normal BMI.Copyright © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2019.

N2  - Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by androgen excess and oligomenorrhea, and commonly driven by hepato-visceral fat excess ("central obesity") ensuing from a mismatch between prenatal and postnatal nutrition, on a background of genetic susceptibility. There is no approved treatment for adolescent PCOS. We report the pooled results of 2 pilot studies in nonobese girls with PCOS (N = 62, age 15.8 years) that compared the effects of randomized treatment for 1 year, either with an oral estro-progestogen contraceptive (OC), or with a low-dose combination of spironolactone-pioglitazone-metformin (SPIOMET, targeting the excess of ectopic fat). Auxological and endocrine-metabolic variables (including fasting insulin, androgens, high-molecular-weight adiponectin [HMW-adiponectin], and microRNA [miR]-451a), body composition (dual x-ray absorptiometry) and hepato-visceral fat (magnetic resonance imaging) were assessed on- and posttreatment. Data from menstrual diaries were combined with weekly salivary progesterone measurements to infer ovulation rates during the second and fourth quarter of the posttreatment year. OC and SPIOMET treatment reduced the androgen excess comparably, and had no differential effects on total-body lean or fat mass. However, SPIOMET was accompanied by more broadly normalizing effects, including on hepato-visceral fat and on circulating insulin, HMW-adiponectin, and miR-451a. On average, there were 3-fold more ovulations post-SPIOMET than post-OC; normovulation was only observed after SPIOMET; anovulation was >10-fold more prevalent post-OC. Pooled results of randomized studies in nonobese adolescent girls with PCOS indicate that SPIOMET treatment leads to an overall healthier, more insulin-sensitive condition-with less ectopic fat-than OC treatment, and to a more normal posttreatment ovulation rate.Copyright © Endocrine Society 2020.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with reproductive and metabolic abnormalities. Aim(s): The aim of this study was to assess novel inflammatory markers [adipokines leptin, adiponectin, and leptin-adiponectin ratio (L/A)] in overweight women with and without PCOS and to examine alterations in these markers [aldosterone, leptin, adiponectin, and L/A] with pharmacological interventions modulating insulin resistance (IR) in PCOS. Materials/subjects and methods: Overweight age, and body mass index (BMI)-matched women with (no.=80) or without PCOS (no.=27) were assessed cross-sectionally. Subjects with PCOS were then randomised to 6 months metformin (1 g b.d, no.=26) or oral contraceptive pill (OCP) (35 g ethinyl estradiol/2 mg cytoproterone acetate, no.=30). Outcome measures were leptin, adiponectin, L/A, aldosterone, highly sensitive C-reactive protein, lipid profile, IR, and androgen levels. Result(s): Leptin levels were lower (156.4+/-85.9 vs 208.5+/-105.2 ng/ml, p=0.015) while adiponectin and L/A were not different between women with and without PCOS. Following intervention, IR increased for the OCP and decreased for metformin, however leptin and aldosterone decreased equivalently with the OCP and metformin with no difference between each treatment (p=0.583 and p=0.801, respectively). There was no change in adiponectin or L/A with the OCP or metformin. On multiple regression, the only baseline predictor of leptin was BMI (r2=0.485, p<0.001) and the strongest predictor of change in leptin was change in weight (r 2=0.402, p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Alterations in leptin between women with and without PCOS and following pharmacological interventions are primarily related to adiposity and not IR. Aldosterone was reduced equivalently with metformin and the OCP despite differential effects on IR. ©2010, Editrice Kurtis.

N2  - Objective: To compare the effectiveness of finasteride and flutamide in the treatment of hirsutism in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and with idiopathic hirsutism. Design(s): Randomized study. Patient(s): One hundred and ten hirsute patients were selected: 64 women with PCOS and 46 with idiopathic hirsutism. Method(s): Patients were assigned randomly to receive 5 mg finasteride once daily or 250 mg of flutamide twice daily, for 12 consecutive months. Hirsutism was evaluated at 12 months of therapy, with the Ferriman-Gallwey score and with measurement of the terminal hair diameters (mum) taken from four different body areas. Blood samples were taken for assessment of endocrine arid hematochemical parameters. Side effects were monitored during the treatment. Result(s): Both finasteride and flutamide induced a significant decrease in the hirsutism scores and hair diameters at the end of 12 months. Finasteride reduced the Ferriman-Gallwey score by 31.4% in the PCOS cases and by 34.2% in the idiopathic hirsutism cases, and hair diameter by 27.0-34.1% in PCOS and by 29.6-37.9% in idiopathic hirsutism. Flutamide reduced the Ferriman-Gallwey score by 56.7% in PCOS and by 50.9% in idiopathic hirsutism, and hair diameter by 50.3-60.0% in PCOS and by 47.7-56.5% in idiopathic hirsutism. Flutamide did not induce hormone variations, while finasteride increased testosterone levels by 40% in PCOS and by 60% in idiopathic hirsutism and decreased 3alpha-androstanediol glucuronide (3alpha-diolG) by 66.7% in PCOS and by 69.5% in idiopathic hirsutism. No important side effects or changes in the hematochemical parameters were observed with finasteride, while two patients (3.6%) in the flutamide group expressed abnormal transaminase levels after 6 months of treatment. Dry skin also appeared significantly more with flutamide (67.3%) than with finasteride (23.6%). Conclusion(s): Both drugs are effective in the treatment of hirsutism but flutamide is more effective than finasteride.

N2  - Background: Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) as a known complication in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) may occur following inducible fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and can affect the sequels of these treatments. Objective(s): This study aimed to assess the effects of OHSS on pregnancy outcomes through IVF in women with PCOS. Also, we assessed the value of baseline sexual hormones to predict the pregnancy's success. Material(s) and Method(s): This case-control study was conducted on 180 consecutive women suffering from PCOS who were candidates for IVF at Fatemieh hospital in Hamadan, Iran, from May-July 2022. The women were assigned to the case group (with OHSS, n = 129) and the control group (without OHSS, n = 51). Measuring the sexual hormones was performed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent technique. Result(s): In the multivariable logistic regression model, OHSS could not predict the likelihood of clinical or chemical pregnancy following IVF. None of the baseline sexual hormones could predict the successful chemical or clinical pregnancy in PCOS women following IVF. Conclusion(s): OHSS may not influence IVF-related outcomes in PCOS women. The values of sexual hormones may not also determine the pointed outcome.Copyright © Pilehvari et al.

N2  - Background: Hirsutism is estimated to affect 10% to 20% of females, provoking significant psychological damage and social embarrassment. Polycystic ovary syndrome is a major cause of hirsutism. Aim(s): Assessing the impact of adding combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or metformin to laser hair removal on the quality of life of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients with hirsutism. Methodology: One-hundred-fifty PCO patients diagnosed with hirsutism were included in this study. Patients were randomized into three groups: group 1 received laser hair removal alone, group 2 received metformin and laser hair removal, and group 3 received COCs and laser hair removal. A diode laser with a wavelength of 810 nm was used for hair removal in all patients according to a protocol of 6 monthly sessions followed by another two sessions after three and six months. Patients were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and a customized questionnaire (Hirsutism Life Quality Index; HLQI). Result(s): All patients showed a significant improvement in both quality indices (DLQI and HLQI) after treatment relative to pretreatment. Group 3 showed significantly better improvements when compared with group 2 and group 1. At three and six months, group 3 showed non-significantly better DLQI and HLQI as compared with at zero months. On the other hand, group 2 patients displayed significant worsening of both DLQI and HLQI scores at three months, with subsequent improvements again at six. Finally, group 1 patients showed nonsignificant worsening at three months, and significant worsening at 6 months. Conclusion(s): Combining hormonal treatment with laser hair removal can achieve greater hair reduction, significant improvements in patients' QOL, and better maintenance as compared with when combining metformin with laser hair removal or conducting alone.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Drugs in Dermatology.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance. Few randomized controlled trials (RCT) compared myoinositol (MI) with metformin (MET) regarding insulin resistance in PCOS. This was an open-label six-month RCT in women with PCOS (n = 45) with interventions MI 4 g/day or MET 2 g/day. Primary outcome was the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Secondary outcomes were fasting glucose, weight, cycle length, lipids, testosterone, adverse effects, quality of life, and depression scores. Median age was 26 years. Body mass was index was 34.4 kg/m2. HOMA-IR was unchanged during MI (p = 0.31) and MET (p = 0.11) (MI vs. MET, p = 0.09). Median fasting glucose changed +0.2 mmol/L during MI (p < 0.001) and -0.1 mmol/L during MET (p = 0.04) (MI vs. MET p < 0.001). Median weight changed -2.3 kg during MI (p = 0.98) and -6.1 kg during MET (p < 0.001) (MI vs. MET, p = 0.02). Median cycle length decreased nine days during MI (p = 0.03) and 13 days during MET (p = 0.03) (MI vs. MET, p = 0.93). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) changed +0.1 mmol/L during MET (p = 0.04) (MI vs. MET, p = 0.07). All other blood parameters and scores of quality of life and depression remained unchanged during MI and MET (all p > 0.06) (MI vs. MET, all p > 0.27). Adverse effects appeared in four women during MI and 16 women during MET (MI vs. MET, p = 0.001). In conclusion, there was no effect on the metabolic outcomes during MI, but positive effects on fasting blood glucose, weight, and HDL during MET. The effect on cycle length was comparable during MI and MET. Adverse effects were less frequent during MI.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder associated with low-grade inflammation and increased incidence of pregnancy complications, but its influence on the maternal immune system in pregnancy is unknown. Longitudinal serum cytokine profiling is a sensitive measure of the complex immunological dynamics of pregnancy. Objective(s): This work aimed to determine the immunological dynamics of serum cytokines throughout pregnancy in women with PCOS and compare it to pregnancy in women without PCOS. Method(s): A post hoc analysis was conducted of longitudinal serum samples from 2 randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter studies of pregnant women with PCOS and 2 studies of pregnant women without PCOS. Pregnant women with PCOS (n=358) and without PCOS (n=258, controls) provided 1752 serum samples from 4 time points in pregnancy (weeks 10, 19, 32, and 36). Main outcome measures included maternal serum levels of 22 cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP) at 4 time points in pregnancy. Result(s): Women with PCOS showed marked immunological changes in serum cytokines throughout pregnancy. Compared to controls, women with PCOS showed higher levels of 17 cytokines and CRP at week 10 of pregnancy and a distinct cytokine development throughout pregnancy. The immunological dynamics in women with PCOS was significantly affected by maternal body mass index, smoking, and fetal sex. Conclusion(s): Pregnancy in women with PCOS was associated with a strong early mobilization of inflammatory and other serum cytokines persisting throughout pregnancy, indicating a more activated immune status. These findings provide a novel basis for further study of PCOS and pregnancy complications.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - Purpose: The majority of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are overweight or obese with increased infertility and high risk of pregnancy complications. We aim to compare efficacy of metformin and exenatide on spontaneous pregnancy rate, overall pregnancy rate after assisted reproductive technology treatment (ART) and pregnancy outcomes in overweight or obese infertility PCOS. Method(s): In this long-term follow-up study, 160 overweight or obese infertility Chinese PCOS were randomized to exenatide or metformin treatment for 12 weeks. Afterward, all were treated with metformin alone until pregnancy confirmed and followed until delivery. If patients failed spontaneous pregnancy during the second 12 weeks, ART could be offered until end of 64 weeks. The primary outcome was spontaneous pregnancy rate. Result(s): At week 24, 29.2% of women in exenatide group conceived spontaneously while 14.7% in metformin group (p = 0.03). At week 64, total pregnancy rates were 79.2% in exenatide group and 76% in metformin group without significant difference (p = 0.65). Between two groups, there was no significant difference of pregnancy outcomes (p > 0.05). A stepwise logistic regression showed that spontaneous pregnancy was positively associated with body weight reduction and HOMA-IR improvement in either group. Conclusion(s): In overweight or obese infertility Chinese PCOS, 12 weeks pregestational exenatide treatment resulted in more spontaneous pregnancy likely due to greater weight reduction and improvement of insulin resistance compared with metformin treatment without obvious benefit on overall pregnancy rate after ART or pregnancy outcomes of successful conceived women. Trial registration: This clinical trial was registered at Chinese Clinical Trials Registry (ChiCTR-IIR-16008084) on 13/3/2016.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Context: The comparative effectiveness of drugs and surgical therapy for women with obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has not been systematically compared. Objective(s): We aimed to determine the difference in efficacy between drug and bariatric surgery therapy for women with obesity and PCOS. Method(s): This prospective nonrandomized trial enrolled 90 women aged 18 to 40 years with body mass index (BMI) >= 27.5 kg/m2 and waist circumference >= 85 cm and fulfilling the 2011 Chinese diagnostic criteria for PCOS; 81 subjects completed the study. In the drug group, patients were administered metformin and an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl-estradiol and cyproterone acetate for the first 6 months, and metformin alone for the second 6 months. In the surgical group, patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies. The follow-up period was 12 months. The main outcome was the complete remission of PCOS, requiring 6 consecutive regular menstruation cycles or spontaneous pregnancy. Result(s): Median BMI at endpoint was 30.1 kg/m2 in the drug group and 23.7 kg/m2 in the surgical group; complete remission rate was 15% and 78%, respectively. Except endpoint BMI, no difference was observed in free androgen index, ovarian morphology, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, and total weight loss between remission and nonremission patients. Logistic regression analyses also revealed that the final BMI was the major factor influencing the remission of PCOS. The cutoff points for the final BMI were 27.5 kg/m2 for the drug group and 26 kg/m2 for the surgical group. Overall, nearly 95% of patients with an endpoint BMI below the cutoff values achieved complete remission. Conclusion(s): Complete remission of PCOS in patients with obesity depends on the final BMI after weight loss. Thus, bariatric surgery should be prioritized for these patients.Copyright © 2022 Endocrine Society. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: To study the efficacy and safety of the GLP-1 analog liraglutide 3 mg (LIRA 3 mg) vs. placebo (PL) for reduction of body weight (BW) and hyperandrogenism in women with obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting(s): Hospital-based outpatient endocrine and metabolic center. Patient(s): Women diagnosed with PCOS (NIH criteria) were randomly assigned to LIRA 3 mg (n = 55) or PL (n = 27) once daily for 32 weeks with lifestyle intervention. Intervention(s): Study visits at baseline and 32 weeks included BW and body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Oral glucose tolerance tests were done with sex steroids, free androgen index (FAI), and lipids measured in the fasting sample. Main Outcome Measure(s): The primary end points were changes in BW and FAI. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. Result(s): Change in BW from baseline to week 32 was -5.7% (+/-0.75) with LIRA 3 mg vs. -1.4% (+/-1.09) with PL. At week 32, more participants on LIRA 3 mg than on PL achieved at least 5% weight reductions (25 of 44 vs. 5 of 23). Free androgen index significantly reduced with LIRA 3 mg compared with the PL where the mean FAI slightly increased. Gastrointestinal events, which were mostly mild to moderate, were reported in 58.2% of the LIRA 3 mg-subjects and 18.5% of PL subjects. Conclusion(s): LIRA 3 mg once daily appears superior to PL in reducing BW and androgenicity and improving cardiometabolic parameters in women with PCOS and obesity.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic low-grade inflammation has emerged as a key contributor to the pathogenesis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). In this regard, the present study examined the potential effects of aerobic exercise on interleukin-6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in PCOS women. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a randomized clinical trial that included 40 females aged 25-35 years diagnosed with PCOS. The participants were divided into two groups equal in number: the aerobic exercise group (AEM), and the metformin group (M). The AEM group performed aerobic exercise three times a week for 12 weeks in addition to metformin treatment. The M group received metformin only. Participants were assessed for IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CRP at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention. RESULT(S): The findings showed a significant reduction in IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CRP values in both AEM and M groups (p=0.001, p=0.01, respectively) after the end of the 12 weeks of the intervention. However, the participants who received aerobic exercise plus metformin, group AEM, showed a greater reduction in IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CRP (p=0.01, p = 0.01 and p=0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Aerobic exercise is effective in lowering IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CRP in polycystic ovarian women. Further clinical trials are recommended to assess the potential effects of aerobic exercise on PCOS-associated risk factors.Copyright © 2022 Verduci Editore s.r.l. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the associations between homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and pregnancy outcomes in non-dyslipidemic infertile women undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo transfer (IVF/ICSI-ET). Material(s) and Method(s): This is a retrospective study involving 3,615 non-dyslipidemic infertile women who attend to the Reproductive Medicine Center of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University (CSU) between January 2014 and October 2021. Eligible participants were divided into three groups according to the quartiles of HOMA-IR: Group 1 (HOMA-IR <1.46), Group 2 (1.46 to <2.71) and Group 3 (HOMA-IR >=2.71). Baseline data, clinical characteristics during the assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedure, pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes were compared among the three groups. Subgroup analysis based on presence or absence of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) status was also performed to analyze the effects of HOMA-IR among non-PCOS populations. Result(s): The late miscarriage rate and percentage of macrosomia increased with the HOMA-IR group (for late miscarriage rate: 2.23% vs. 3.04% vs. 7.35%, P<0.001; for macrosomia: 0.21% vs. 1.70% vs. 3.23%, P=0.002). Increased HOMA-IR (HOMA-IR>=2.71) was positively associated with late miscarriage (crude OR 3.50, 95% CI 1.64-7.47, P=0.001; adjusted OR 3.56, 95% CI 1.56-8.15, P=0.003). In the subgroup analysis, there were 3,165 participants in the non-PCOS group and 450 were assigned to the PCOS group. Late miscarriage rate increased with the HOMA-IR group among non-PCOS populations (2.20% vs. 3.03% vs. 7.67%, P<0.001). Late miscarriage rate of PCOS women were comparable among the three HOMA-IR groups (2.50% vs. 3.06% vs. 5.71%, P=0.634). Among non-PCOS women, increased HOMA-IR (HOMA-IR>=2.71) was positively associated with late miscarriage (crude OR 3.71, 95% CI 1.66-8.30, P=0.001; adjusted OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.59-9.17, P=0.003). Conclusion(s): Late miscarriage rate and prevalence of macrosomia increased with the HOMA-IR index. Preconception HOMA-IR is an independent risk factor for late miscarriage in normolipidemic women undergoing IVF/ICSI-ET. Controlling insulin resistance before ART might prevent the occurrence of late miscarriage and macrosomia.Copyright © 2022 Yang, Yang, Zhang, Liu, Liu, Li, Yao, Zhang, Tian, Zhao and Li.

N2  - Purpose: This work aimed to evaluate the adverse effect of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) on pregnancy outcomes of singletons after vitrification in women with frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET). Method(s): Patients with/without PCOS who underwent FET from January 2013 and December 2018 were included. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to reduce the influence of bias. Logistic regression was applied to identify the risk factors of adverse pregnancy outcomes of singletons in women with PCOS. Result(s): After PSM, the PCOS group had shorter gestational age (P<0.001) and lower newborn birth weight than the non-PCOS group (P=0.045). Compared with the non-PCOS group, the PCOS group had an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) (P<0.001), placenta and membrane abnormality (P<0.001), stillbirth (P<0.001), neonatal complication (P=0.014), and miscarriage rate (P<0.001). Neonatal complication was associated with parity (adjusted OR=1.202, 95% CI=1.002-1.443, P=0.048) and basal P level (adjusted OR=1.211, 95% CI=1.021-1.436, P=0.028). According to multivariable logistic regression analysis, the miscarriage rate was related to parity (adjusted OR=1.201, 95% CI=1.057-1.166, P=0.005) and basal E2 (adjusted OR=1.002, 95% CI=1.000-1.004, P=0.019) and P levels on the day of embryo transfer (adjusted OR=0.971, 95% CI=0.957-0.985, P<0.001). Conclusion(s): Compared with non-PCOS women, women with PCOS have a higher risk of GDM and PIH, and neonatal complications and therefore require additional care during pregnancy and parturition.Copyright © 2022 Ni, Mei, You, Lin, Cheng, Zhou, Kuang and Yu.

N2  - Objective: This study aims to evaluate the association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes and adverse perinatal outcomes, comparing the characteristics, ovarian response, and assisted reproductive outcomes in patients with various PCOS phenotypes after in-vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Method(s): This study comprised 6,732 patients who underwent the first cycle of IVF/ICSI treatment in our outpatient department from January 2017 to July 2018. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used in PCOS and non-PCOS groups to balance the influence of intergroup confounding factors. After the PSM procedure, 1,186 patients were included in the two groups, and the PCOS patients were further divided into four PCOS phenotype groups based on the Rotterdam criteria. Result(s): Patients with various PCOS phenotypes had similar rates of biochemical pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, and live birth (all P-values > 0.05). The overall incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes (including ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, preterm birth) was significantly higher in PCOS phenotype A and D groups than in the control group (44% and 46.4% vs. 28.7%, P = 0.027). The rates of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) were significantly higher in PCOS phenotype A and C groups than in the control group (9.3% and 12.5% vs. 3.1%, P = 0.037). After adjustment for potential confounders, the differences in adverse pregnancy outcomes persisted (P = 0.025). Conclusion(s): The overall incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes is higher in women with PCOS phenotypes A and D than in women with non-PCOS.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Wang, Li, Li, Wang, Yan and Shi.

N2  - Objective: This study aimed to assess the effect on the cardiovascular independent risk factor Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] in overweight or obese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with ethinyl-estradiol/drospirenone (EE/DRSP) alone or plus orlistat. Method(s): In this randomized controlled prospective study, 66 PCOS patients with overweight or obesity were matched according to age and BMI. All participants were randomly divided into two groups to receive EE/DRSP plus Orlistat (n = 33) or EE/DRSP alone (n = 33) for 3 months. Changes in cardiovascular risk factors including Lp(a), CRP, LDL-C, anthropometric assessments, variations in sex hormones related parameters, and in glucolipid metabolic index were evaluated after the intervention. Result(s): Lp(a) and CRP were significantly decreased at 3 months only in the EE/DRSP plus Orlistat group. There were significant reductions in LDL-C, weight, BMI, waist circumference (WC), body fat percentage (BFP), FT in both groups compared to baseline. However, these reductions were significantly greater in EE/DRSP plus Orlistat group. The levels of HDL-C, TG, and SHBG significantly increased, while TT and LH significantly decreased in both groups over time. TC, FINS, FPG were not significantly changed in both groups after the intervention. Conclusion(s): This is the first study found that EE/DRSP plus Orlistat could significantly decrease Lp(a) in overweight or obese PCOS patients. This result can be assessed as particularly important, because Lp(a) is well-known as an independent risk factor predicting an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).Copyright © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women and a high risk factor for adverse pregnancy complications. Therefore, we aimed to analyse the relationship between PCOS and pregnancy complications in a large sample from China. Additionally, since obesity and assisted reproductive technology (ART) are common in women with PCOS, we also aimed to determine whether both of these factors increased the complication incidence for women with PCOS. A retrospective cohort study that included 1357 pregnant women with PCOS and 6940 without PCOS was performed. Our results indicated women with PCOS had higher incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertension, postpartum haemorrhage, preterm birth, macrosomia and cervical incompetence. Additionally, obesity was associated with an increased incidence of hypertension and GDM in women with PCOS generally. ART did not result in an increase in the obstetric complication rate in women with PCOS. In conclusion, PCOS appeared to result in an increased risk of adverse pregnancy complications. Obesity may further increase the risks of hypertension and GDM among women with PCOS. However, ART did not increase the risk of pregnancy complications, which suggests that ART is a relatively safe and effective method to address infertility problems in women with PCOS.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? There are several studies evaluating the associations of PCOS with the risk of pregnancy complications. However, reports about the risk of pregnancy complications between PCOS women with and without obesity or ART are limited. What do the results of this study add? PCOS appeared to increase the risk of adverse pregnancy complications, including GDM, pregnancy-induced hypertension, postpartum haemorrhage, preterm birth, macrosomia and cervical incompetence. Obesity further increased the risks of hypertension and GDM in women with PCOS, but it did not increase the incidence of macrosomia and postpartum haemorrhage. Additionally, ART did not increase the risk of adverse pregnancy complications among women with PCOS, except for postpartum haemorrhage. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? This study contributes to the literature because it showed that PCOS independently increased the risk of adverse pregnancy complications in a large sample of patients. Second, obesity is a high risk factor for adverse complications in pregnant women with PCOS. Third, ART is a relatively safe and effective method for addressing infertility problems for women with PCOS.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Metformin and spironolactone alone can be used for the management of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and their combination could result in even better outcomes. To compare the effects and safety of low-dose spironolactone combined with metformin or either drug alone on insulin resistance (IR) and functional improvement in patients with PCOS, this was a single-center, randomized, open-label, pilot study of patients with PCOS at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University between 01/2014 and 01/2016. The participants were randomized 1: 1: 1 to metformin, spironolactone, or metformin + spironolactone. The primary endpoint was the change in the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR after 12 weeks of treatment. A total of 189 participants were randomized (63 per group); 31 dropped out, and 54, 51, and 53 completed the 12-week treatment in the metformin, spironolactone, and combined groups, respectively. There were no differences in any parameters between the metformin and spironolactone groups (all P > 0.05). In the combined group, after 12 weeks of treatment, HOMA-IR (1.71 +/- 0.91) was lower than in the metformin (1.92 +/- 1.07, P < 0.05) and spironolactone (2.38 +/- 1.14, P < 0.05) groups. In addition, total testosterone (TT), free androgen index (FAI), and area under the curve-insulin (AUCins) were lower in the combined group compared with the metformin group (all P < 0.05), while TT, FAI, HOMA-beta, fasting plasma glucose, and AUCins were lower in the spironolactone group (all P < 0.05). Both metformin and spironolactone decreased HOMA-IR in patients with PCOS but without differences between the two monotherapies. The combined therapy decreased HOMA-IR to a greater extent than monotherapy.Copyright © 2022 Tao Long et al.

N2  - Follicle arrest is one of the main characteristics of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrinological disorder in reproductive-aged women. Increasing evidence proves that high anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels may play an important role in follicular development. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) with a length of more than 200 nt is widely involved in the directional differentiation, growth, and development of cells, whereas whether lncRNA is involved in AMH's role in follicular development is unknown. In this study, we analyzed lncRNA expression in ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) collected from women with and without PCOS via high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that a total of 79 noncoding transcripts were differently expressed in GCs of PCOS patients, including upregulated lncRNA MALAT1. The upregulation of MALAT1 was further confirmed by RT-qPCR in GCs from a larger cohort of PCOS patients. Furthermore, knockdown MALAT1 can promote the proliferation of KGN cell in vitro. These data suggested a role for MALAT1 in the development of PCOS. Meanwhile, MALAT1 and phosphorylated SMAD 1/5 (Ser463/465) protein were upregulated in KGN cells after exogenous AMH stimulation, which identified AMH perhaps as a regulator for the expression of MALAT1. We also found that MALAT1 can predict clinical pregnancy outcome to a certain extent by ROC curve analysis (area: 0.771, p = 0.007, 95% CI: 0.617-0.925, sensitivity: 57.1%, specificity: 91.7%). Thus, our findings revealed a role of lncRNA MALAT1 in inhibiting granulosa cell proliferation and may be correlated with pregnancy outcome in PCOS.Copyright © 2022 Tu, Wu, Wang, Huang, Qian, Li, Lv, Ying, Liu, Liu, Zhang, Zhao and Zhang.

N2  - Objective: To study the effects of myoinositol (Myo) in comparison to metformin (Met), in reducing the risk of OHSS and improving ART outcome in PCOS women undergoing IVF. Design(s): Double-blinded randomized controlled trial (CTRI/2018/05/014196). Setting(s): ART Clinic, AIIMS, New Delhi patients: 102 infertile PCOS women undergoing IVF cycles were enrolled after evaluating for eligibility and allotted as 50 in group 1 (Myo) and 52 in group 2 (Met) after randomization. Intervention(s): Recruited patients received Myo 2 g twice daily (group 1) and Met 850 mg twice daily (group 2). Pre- and post-treatment clinical (menstrual pattern, BMI), hormonal profile (LH, FSH, testosterone, prolactin [PRL], and AMH), biochemical parameters (HOMA IR, fasting glucose, and insulin), ovarian with antral follicle count (AFC) and side effect profile were assessed. After 3 months of therapy, patients were recruited for IVF cycle by antagonist protocol was involving controlled ovarian stimulation, cycle monitoring, oocyte recovery, insemination of oocytes and follow up with fertilization, cleavage, transfer of good grade cleavage embryos, or blastocysts pregnancy outcomes and OHSS incidence and medications was continued until the day of OPU. Main Outcome Measure(s): Primary outcome was OHSS and clinical pregnancy rate including spontaneous, IVF, and cumulative pregnancy rate including FET. Secondary outcome was ART outcomes and the change in biochemistry and hormonal profile between groups and inter group after medications at 12 weeks. Result(s): Incidence of OHSS (Myo 5 (10.0) (n = 50), Met 10 (20.0) (n = 50) p.07) was not statistically different between groups. Clinical pregnancy rate (Myo 18 (36.0) (n = 50), Met 9 (18.0) (n = 50) p.04) cumulative pregnancy rate including FET (Myo 16 (43.2) (n = 37) vs. Met 10) 22.7) (n = 44) p.05) and spontaneous conception (prior to IVF) Myo 13 (26.0) (n = 50), Met 6 (12.0) (n = 50) p.07) was significantly high in Myo group. No between group difference in ovarian stimulation outcomes including duration and dosage of gonadotropins, E2, P4 levels, number of follicles >14 mm on day of trigger. Number of oocytes retrieved and grade of maturity were similar between groups. Fertilization, cleavage and number of good grade embryos were significantly higher in Myo group. However, implantation rate and number of embryos for freezing were similar between groups. Myo had improvement in fasting insulin, HOMA, Sr.AMH, and SHBG suggesting decreased insulin resistance Conclusion(s): Myo is equally beneficial as Met in reducing the risk of OHSS and has better ART outcome in PCOS women undergoing antagonist cycles.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Treatment of hirsutism is usually resistant, and from medical management to laser hair reduction, the treatment of hirsutism and its assessment are the most challenging. The aim of the study was to compare the response to treatment by laser hair reduction with long pulsed (1064 nm) Nd:YAG laser in patients of idiopathic hirsutism and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) by clinical and trichoscopic assessment. A hospital-based comparative, observational prospective study was carried out on female patients with hirsutism over a period of 18 months with two groups of participants: fifty women with idiopathic hirsutism (group A) and fifty with PCOS (group B). Laser hair reduction was done with long pulsed (1064 nm) Nd:YAG laser in both groups up to six sessions, 4 weeks apart and followed for 3 months post last laser session. After the sixth session of laser hair reduction, excellent response (> 75% reduction) from baseline was seen in 70% of patients in group A and in 54% of patients in group B. After 3 months of follow-up of the last laser session, it was found that the results persisted in patients with idiopathic cause than in those due to PCOS, seen both clinically and trichoscopically with decrease in hair shaft thickness, hair shaft colour, terminal vs. vellus hair ratio and hair density per cm2. Hirsutism due to idiopathic cause responds better to laser hair reduction with long pulsed (1064 nm) Nd:YAG laser than that due to PCOS, due to underlying hormonal imbalance in the latter group. Follow-up of only up to 3 months after last laser session was done and tricoscan was not done.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Objectives: 1) To explore the associations between autistic traits and sex hormone changes in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); 2) To explore the influence of PCOS parental autistic traits and related sex hormone changes on autistic traits in their offspring. Method(s): This is a case-control study that recruited two groups: polycystic ovarian syndrome-induced infertile subjects as the observation group and fallopian tube factor-induced infertility subjects as the control group. Both cohorts were patients undergoing infertility treatment in the Productive Medicine Center, Peking University People's Hospital. Two types of questionnaires were completed by patients between May 1st, 2015, and May 1st, 2016: 1. The autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) 2. Repetitive behavior scale-revised (RBS-r). Levels of sex hormones in serum were measured in patients. The correlations between the levels of these biochemical factors and scores of the autistic traits were analysed. From July 1st, 2020 to September 1st, 2021, these patients were followed up by telephone and asked to fill out a questionnaire online. The questionnaire included date of delivery, complications, medicine used and negative events during pregnancy (e.g., death of relatives, divorce, etc.), delivery condition, breastfeeding, AQ scale and Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) of their children. Result(s): The patients in the PCOS group had significantly higher AQ scores than those in the control group. Levels of luteinizing hormone and testosterone were also higher in the PCOS group. No significant differences were found between the two groups in RBS-r levels, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol or progesterone. In the two combined groups, there were significantly positive correlations between the AQ scores and the luteinizing hormone concentration, as well as between scores of RBS-r and testosterone concentration. Moreover, there was a significantly negative correlation between the level of progesterone and the RBS-r score. According to the follow-up data, the AQ scores of offspring were positively correlated with the RBS-r scores of their mothers. The ABC scores of offspring were positively correlated with the RBS-r scores and the childbearing age of their mothers. No significant difference was found between the two groups in age of delivery, complications, special medication used, negative events during pregnancy, delivery situation, postpartum breastfeeding, age of children, or AQ scores or ABC scores of children. There were no significant correlations between the scale scores of children and the related sex hormone levels of mothers. This could indicate that the higher levels of luteinizing hormone and testosterone and the lower level of progesterone accompanied more pronounced autistic traits in PCOS. Furthermore, the higher delivery age and RBS-r score in mothers accompanied the higher AQ and ABC scores in children. Conclusion(s): Compared with the control group, PCOS patients had more autistic traits (especially social dysfunction). The autistic traits in PCOS patients might be related to the elevation in testosterone concentration and luteinizing hormone levels and the decline in progesterone level. Moreover, the autistic traits in the offspring of PCOS patients might be related to the parental high delivery age and high tendency to autism traits.Copyright © 2022 Jiang, Tian, Yuan, Xu, Qu, Zhang and Wang.

N2  - Purpose: Bariatric surgery is very efficacious in treating severe obesity. However, its effect on menstruation and ovulation is currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of gastric sleeve resection (GSR) on menstrual pattern in women with stages III-IV obesity and ovulatory dysfunction compared with conventional management. Method(s): This was a prospective, multicentre, non-randomized trial, in premenopausal women, who fulfilled the criteria for gastric sleeve resection (GSR). Both women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were evaluated at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months post-surgery. Result(s): Menstrual cycle irregularities were identified in 122 severely obese women (60 with PCOS; 62 without PCOS). The % total weight loss was greater with GSR than with conventional management (33.4% vs. 3.6% in PCOS; 24.8% vs. 3.6% in non-PCOS, respectively). Intermenstrual interval was shortened towards normal length (<= 35 days) both in PCOS and non-PCOS GSR groups, by the 6th and 12th post-surgical month, respectively. Furthermore, ovulation at 6 months was achieved in 63.6% of PCOS and 45% of non-PCOS subjects post-GSR, which was higher than in controls (11.1% and 13.6%, respectively; p < 0.05). This percentage rose to 75.7% and 81.8% at 12 and 15 months in PCOS, respectively, but not in the non-PCOS group (55% and 52.5%, respectively; p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Weight reduction after GSR improved menstrual irregularity towards normality in women with severe obesity. Ovulation dysfunction was also resumed in more than half of these patients at 6-15 months. These effects were more evident in women with PCOS.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the safety and efficacy of canagliflozin in comparison to metformin in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with insulin resistance (IR). Method(s): A single-centre, prospective, randomized open-label (ratio 1:1) noninferiority trial was conducted at the Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, between July 2019 and April 2021. Women aged 18 to 45 years with PCOS and IR were enrolled and randomly assigned to either 100 mg (n = 33) canagliflozin daily or 1500 to 2000 mg metformin daily (n = 35) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was changes in homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR after 12 weeks of treatment. The secondary outcomes included changes in anthropometric measurements, menstrual frequency, sex hormone levels, metabolic variables and body fat distribution. Result(s): For lowering of HOMA-IR after 12 weeks of treatment, canagliflozin was found to be noninferior to metformin (least-squares mean difference -0.81% [95% confidence interval -2.13 to 0.51]). Both canagliflozin and metformin significantly improved menstrual pattern, reduced body weight and total fat mass, and decreased triglyceride levels. Compared with metformin, canagliflozin had significant advantages in reducing uric acid and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels. Pruritus vulvae (9.09%) and gastrointestinal reaction (55.55%) were the main adverse events in the metformin group and canagliflozin group, respectively. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that canagliflozin was not inferior to metformin in PCOS patients with IR, which suggests that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors should be considered as effective drugs in the treatment of PCOS patients with IR.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: To compare the effects of insulin sensitizers metformin (MET) and myo-inositol (MI) on adiponectin levels and metabolic characteristics in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with respect to their body mass index (BMI). Method(s): In this open label, parallel randomized clinical trial, 66 women with PCOS (33 normal-weight and 33 overweight/obese) were randomized to either MI (4 g/day) or MET (1500 mg/day) for a period of 6 months. Serum concentration of adiponectin, hormonal and metabolic laboratory outcomes and clinical assessment of BMI, body composition and Ferriman-Gallwey score (FG score) were evaluated before and after treatment. Result(s): After the 6-month intervention, comparison between MET and MI in time to treatment analysis showed no significant differences between the two treatments for all analyzed parameters. Only borderline significantly lower AUC glucose was found in the MET group in comparison to the MI group (p = 0.071). The main effect of treatment was shown for glucose concentration at 120 min OGTT (p = 0.032) and testosterone (p = 0.002). The main effect of time was shown for body mass (p = 0.004), waist circumference (p < 0.001), BMI (p = 0.003), body fat mass (p = 0.001), adiponectin (p = 0.020), fasting glucose (p = 0.001), testosterone (p = 0.015), SHBG (p = 0.013), 17OH progesterone (p = 0.008), LH (p = 0.004) and estradiol (p = 0.014). Conclusion(s): Our study showed similar effects of MET and MI on BMI, body composition, hormonal profile, metabolism of glucose and insulin, and adiponectin level. The two insulin sensitizers, MET and MI, were useful in reducing BMI and improving body composition without significant differences between the two treatments in PCOS women.

N2  - Objective: To determine the cutoff values of HOMA-IR for predicting clinical pregnancy rate in normal weight patients during their first IVF. Material(s) and Method(s): The data was retrospectively analyzed from 329 normal-weight women aged 21-40 years with BMI <25 kg/m2 who received first IVF-ET during the period from December 2018 to June 2019.We assessed the associations between HOMA-IR and clinical pregnancy rates during IVF in the women with or without PCOS according to different BMI ranges. Result(s): In non PCOS,clinical pregnancy rate was significantly decreased at the HOMA-IR values ranging from 2.2 to 3.15 (OR, 0.188, 95% CI, 0.084-0.42; p <.05) and at those >3.15 (OR, 0.018, 95% CI, 0.004-0.081; p <.05).In PCOS, clinical pregnancy rate significantly decreased at the HOMA-IR >3.15 (OR, 0.15, 95% CI, 0.044-0.507; p <.05). In non PCOS with BMI <21.45 kg/m2, clinical pregnancy rate was decreased with HOMA-IR >2.2, and a significant cutoff point at HOMA-IR >3.15; with 21.45 <= BMI <25 kg/m2, clinical pregnancy rate was declined significantly at the HOMA-IR >1.56 (OR, 0.196, 95% CI, 0.055-0.704).In PCOS with BMI <21.45 kg/m2, clinical pregnancy rate was decreased as the HOMA-IR increased, but there was no significant cutoff point; with 21.45 <= BMI < 25 kg/m2, clinical pregnancy rate was declined significantly at the HOMA-IR > 3.15 (OR, 0.186; 95% CI, 0.04-0.872). Conclusion(s): HOMA-IR and BMI had adverse effects on the IVF outcome of infertility women. Moreover, obesity can increase the degree of insulin resistance in infertility women. These findings suggested that only better HOMA-IR and BMI will lead to better IVF results.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Weight loss is the mainstay of management for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). However, lifestyle and dietary modifications, and gastric banding have generally poor long-term efficacy. We aimed to investigate whether gastric bypass is equally efficacious in women with or without PCOS. METHOD(S): We performed a matched case-control study of primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in women with PCOS (cases, n = 30) compared to women without PCOS (controls, n = 60) matched for baseline age, body mass index (BMI) and presence or absence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Data shown represent mean values. RESULT(S): At 24 months after surgery the 90 participants (age 36.1 years) experienced significant reductions in BMI (53.4 vs. 34.9 kg/m2, p < 0.0001), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in 21 women with T2D (68.2 vs. 38.7 mmol/mol, p < 0.0001) and blood pressure (BP) in 29 women with hypertension (144/91 vs. 129/83 mmHg, p < 0.01), while obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) resolved in 88.0% of the 25 affected patients. Women with PCOS compared to women without PCOS achieved equivalent reductions in percentage total weight loss (32.6% vs. 32.6% at 12 months and 34.8% vs. 36.1% at 24 months) and HbA1c (T2D subgroup; 38.3 vs. 41.6 mmol/mol at 12 months and 37.0 vs. 39.6 mmol/mol at 24 months) and comparable improvement in BP (hypertension subgroup) and resolution of OSA (87.5% vs. 88.2% at 24 months). CONCLUSION(S): In women with PCOS with morbid obesity, gastric bypass resulted in significant weight loss and metabolic outcomes similar to women without PCOS.Copyright © 2021 Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (Scottish charity number SC005317) and Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.

N2  - This study was aimed to investigate the effect of weight loss by bariatric surgery on the level of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in morbidly obese female patients with or without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This prospective study includes 70 females, obese, and fertile patients of reproductive age. All patients were evaluated to determine the changes in weight, body mass index (BMI), serum AMH, and other biochemical parameters at the end of six months. The mean levels of the preop and postop AMH were 1.66+/-0.87 ng/ml and 5.99+/-1.39 ng/ml in the PCOS group; 1.35+/-0.76 ng/ml and 6.23+/-1.47 ng/ml in the non-PCOS group, respectively. The postop AMH levels were significantly higher than the preop levels for both groups (p<0.001). There were significant differences in the level of glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride, total cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, HOMA-IR, insulin between preop and postop 6th month. A negative correlation was found between postop AMH and body weight in all patients (r=-0.337, p=0.031). Postop AMH levels were negatively correlated with postop BMI levels in the non-PCOS patient group (r=-0.408, p=0.043). No significant difference was observed between the PCOS and non-PCOS groups in terms of all the parameters examined. In conclusion, our study suggests that the significantly increased AMH levels by losing weight with bariatric surgery in patients with morbid obesity with and without PCOS may indicate the improvement of fertilization potential. It could be considered when evaluating fertility in patients with morbid obesity.Copyright © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background:Obesity and insulin resistance (IR) are common features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Metformin (MET) increases insulin sensitivity, but it is associated with unsatisfactory weight loss. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist exenatide has been shown to reduce weight and IR in patients with diabetes. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effects of exenatide once-weekly (QW) combined with MET on body weight, as well as metabolic and endocrinological parameters in overweight/obese women with PCOS. Method(s):Fifty overweight/obese women with PCOS diagnosed via the Rotterdam criteria were randomized to one of two treatment groups: MET (500 mg three times a day [TID]) or combination treatment (COM) (MET 500 mg TID, exenatide 2 mg QW) for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were anthropometric changes associated with obesity, and the secondary outcomes included changes in reproductive hormone levels, glucose and lipid metabolism, and C-reactive protein. Result(s):Forty (80%) patients completed the study. COM therapy was superior to MET monotherapy in reducing weight (P = 0.045), body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.041), and waist circumference (P = 0.023). Patients in the COM group on an average lost 3.8 +/- 2.4 kg compared with 2.1 +/- 3.0 kg in the MET group. In the COM group, BMI and waist circumference decreased by 1.4 +/- 0.87 kg/m2and 4.63 +/- 4.42 cm compared with 0.77 +/- 1.17 kg/m2and 1.72 +/- 3.07 cm in the MET group, respectively. Moreover, levels of fasting glucose, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 2-h glucose, and OGTT 2-h insulin were significantly lower with COM therapy than with MET (P < 0.050). Mild and moderate gastrointestinal reactions were the most common adverse events in both groups. Conclusion(s):COM therapy was more effective than MET alone in reducing body weight, BMI, and waist circumference, and improving insulin sensitivity in overweight/obese women with PCOS, with acceptable short-term side effects.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04029272. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04029272.Copyright © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is quite common among women of reproductive age and can cause infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Current studies on PCOS mainly focus on the effect of PCOS on pregnancy. So far, it remains unelucidated whether a history of infertility or early pregnancy loss (EPL) has differential effects on obstetric outcomes for PCOS women. Method(s): This is a retrospective case control study. Ninety-two Chinese PCOS patients with a history of EPL or infertility were recruited in our study. A total of 112 Chinese non-PCOS patients with a history of EPL or infertility were taken as control group. Measurements included anthropometric data, serum total testosterone, fasting and two-hour plasma glucose levels, and antral follicle count. After they got pregnant (naturally or via assisted reproductive technology), all obstetric outcomes were observed and analyzed. Result(s): PCOS women with a history of EPL showed a much higher cesarean section (CS) rate than PCOS women with primary infertility. PCOS women with a history of EPL showed a much higher possibility of GDM (gestational diabetes mellitus) compared with PCOS women with primary infertility. PCOS women with a history of EPL showed a much higher possibility of GDM compared with non-PCOS women with a history of EPL. PCOS women with a history of EPL showed increased possibility of GDM as their BMI increased. When BMI is above 28, the incidence of GDM is significantly higher in PCOS women with a history of EPL compared with that in PCOS women with infertility. Conclusion(s): Both a history of EPL and obesity are risk factors for GDM for PCOS women, and higher BMI indicates a higher possibility of GDM among PCOS women with a history of EPL. Timely intervention is in need for PCOS women with EPL and a higher BMI.Copyright © 2021 Liu et al.

N2  - Aim: We evaluated the effect of the latest GLP-1 RA semaglutide on tongue fat storage in obese women. Design. We conducted a randomized single-blind, pilot study. Method(s): Twenty-five obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (33.7 +/- 5.3 years, body mass index (BMI) 36.1 +/- 3.9 kg/m2, mean +/- SD) were randomized to semaglutide 1.0 mg or placebo for 16 weeks. We quantified tongue volume and its fat tissue and fat proportion by magnetic resonance imaging. Result(s): Tongue fat tissue and fat proportion significantly reduced after semaglutide vs placebo (-1.94 +/- 5.51 vs. + 3.12 +/- 4.87 cm3, p = 0.022, and -0.02 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.06, p = 0.010, respectively). Correlation analysis revealed that these reductions were associated with those in body weight, BMI and waist circumference (p = 0.010 for all). Conclusion(s): This is the first study confirming the beneficial effect of semaglutide on tongue structure in obese women with PCOS. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical importance of such findings.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Progestin-primed ovarian stimulation (PPOS) regimen was established for assisted reproduction. However, its feasibility and outcomes in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients need further evaluation. The outcomes of infertile patients with PCOS (study group) and normal ovaries (control group with unexplained infertility and tubal factor infertility) who underwent PPOS and IVF/ICSI protocol were retrospectively studied. The baseline information, primary, and secondary outcomes of patients were collected. The dynamic changes of hormones were closely monitored. 198 PCOS patients and 374 controls were included in this study. After controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), 15 oocytes were retrieved from PCOS patients on average, which was more than those from the controls (p < 0.001). The oocytes and embryos obtained from the PCOS patients exhibited better developmental potential as the number of fertilized oocytes, cleaved embryos, top-quality embryos, viable embryos, cryopreserved embryos, the rate of fertilization, and viable embryo per oocyte retrieved in PCOS patients were significantly higher than those in the controls (all p < 0.001). No significant difference between the two groups was identified regarding the primary outcome, ongoing pregnancy, and other secondary outcomes. No moderate to severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) was diagnosed in either group. With the proposed PPOS protocol, the quantity, quality, developmental potential of oocytes, and embryos obtained from PCOS patients were superior to those from controls. The protocol was efficient and safe in terms of pregnancy, obstetric, and perinatal outcomes. OHSS was effectively mitigated in the patients, with or without PCOS, who underwent COH.Copyright © 2021 Society for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.

N2  - A prime concern of young patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the control of body adiposity, given their tendency to gain weight and/or their difficulty to lose weight. Circulating growth-and-differentiation factor-15 (GDF15) facilitates the control of body weight via receptors in the brainstem. C-reactive protein (CRP) and insulin are endogenous GDF15 secretagogues. We hypothesised that PCOS in non-obese adolescents is characterised by low concentrations of circulating GDF15, when judged by the degree of CRP and insulin drive. GDF15 was added as a post-hoc endpoint of two previously reported, randomised studies in non-obese adolescent girls with PCOS (N=58; 60% normal weight; 40% overweight) who received either an oral oestroprogestogen contraceptive (OC), or a low-dose combination of spironolactone-pioglitazone-metformin (SPIOMET) for 1 year; subsequently, all girls remained untreated for 1 year. Adolescent girls with regular menses (N=20) served as healthy controls. Circulating GDF15, CRP and fasting insulin were assessed prior to treatment, and halfway the on- and post-treatment years. Pre-treatment, the absolute GDF15 concentrations were normal in PCOS girls, but their relative levels were markedly low, in view of the augmented CRP and insulin drives. OC treatment was accompanied by a near-doubling of circulating GDF15 (on average, from 296 to 507 pg/mL) and CRP, so that the relative GDF15 levels remained low. SPIOMET treatment was accompanied by a 3.4-fold rise of circulating GDF15 (on average, from 308 to 1045 pg/mL) and by a concomitant lowering of CRP and insulin concentrations towards normal, so that the relative GDF15 levels became markedly abundant. Post-OC, the relatively low GDF15 levels persisted; post-SPIOMET, the circulating concentrations of GDF15, CRP and insulin were all normal. BMI remained stable in both treatment groups. Only SPIOMET was accompanied by a reduction of hepato-visceral fat (by MRI) towards normal. In conclusion, early PCOS was found to be characterised by a relative GDF15 deficit that may partly explain the difficulties that young patients experience to control their body adiposity. This relative GDF15 deficit persisted during and after OC treatment. In contrast, SPIOMET treatment was accompanied by an absolute and a relative abundance of GDF15, and followed by normal GDF15, CRP and insulin concentrations. The present findings strengthen the rationale to raise the concentrations of circulating GDF15 in early PCOS, for example with a SPIOMET-like intervention that attenuates low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance and ectopic adiposity, without necessarily lowering body weight.Clinical trial registries: ISRCTN29234515 and ISRCTN11062950.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Hirsutism is estimated to affect 10% to 20% of females, provoking significant psychological damage and social embarrassment. Polycystic ovary syndrome is a major cause of hirsutism. AIM: Assessing the impact of adding combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or metformin to laser hair removal on the quality of life of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients with hirsutism. METHODOLOGY: One-hundred-fifty PCO patients diagnosed with hirsutism were included in this study. Patients were randomized into three groups: group 1 received laser hair removal alone, group 2 received metformin and laser hair removal, and group 3 received COCs and laser hair removal. A diode laser with a wavelength of 810 nm was used for hair removal in all patients according to a protocol of 6 monthly sessions followed by another two sessions after three and six months. Patients were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and a customized questionnaire (Hirsutism Life Quality Index; HLQI). RESULT(S): All patients showed a significant improvement in both quality indices (DLQI and HLQI) after treatment relative to pretreatment. Group 3 showed significantly better improvements when compared with group 2 and group 1. At three and six months, group 3 showed non-significantly better DLQI and HLQI as compared with at zero months. On the other hand, group 2 patients displayed significant worsening of both DLQI and HLQI scores at three months, with subsequent improvements again at six. Finally, group 1 patients showed nonsignificant worsening at three months, and significant worsening at 6 months. CONCLUSION(S): Combining hormonal treatment with laser hair removal can achieve greater hair reduction, significant improvements in patients' QOL, and better maintenance as compared with when combining metformin with laser hair removal or conducting alone.

N2  - Purpose: To compare the effects of oral contraceptives (OCs) with different progestins, including Levonorgestrel (LNG), Desogestrel (DSG), Cyproterone Acetate (CPA), and Drospirenone (DRSP) on adipokines levels and adiposity indices in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): In this parallel randomized clinical trial, 120 women with PCOS randomly assigned to intervention with OCs containing LNG, DSG, CPA, or DRSP. Outcomes of interest, including serum concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, and resistin, and adiposity indices, i.e., body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), obesity, central obesity, waist to hip ratio (WHR), waist to height ratio (WHtR), lipid accumulation product (LAP), a body shape index (ABSI), body roundness index (BRI), and visceral adiposity index (VAI), and lipid profiles were assessed at baseline, and 6 months of treatment. Result(s): This study showed no significant differences in serum concentrations of adipokines between the four study groups after 6 months of treatment. Our results also showed that patients treated with various compounds of OC for 6 months had no significant differences in their adiposity indices, except for LAP (p = 0.04), and VAI (p = 0.03). PCOS patients treated with OCs containing CPA had significantly a higher mean LAP, compared to those using products containing LNG. Besides, patients treated with OCs containing CPA had significantly a higher mean VAI, compared to those treated with OCs containing DRSP. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that OCs with low androgenic and antiandrogenic activities had identical effects on serum concentrations of adipokines, and adiposity indices, except LAP, and VAI parameters.

N2  - Studies suggest that non-pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may be at elevated risk of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that 25(OH)D may also play an important role during pregnancy. Data regarding 25(OH)D deficiency during pregnancy in PCOS patients and its association with perinatal outcome is scarce. The aim of the study was to investigate whether mothers with and without PCOS have different 25(OH)D levels at term, how maternal 25(OH)D levels are reflected in their offspring, and if 25(OH)D levels are associated with an adverse perinatal outcome. Therefore, we performed a cross-sectional observational study and included 79 women with PCOS according to the ESHRE/ASRM 2003 definition and 354 women without PCOS and an ongoing pregnancy >= 37 + 0 weeks of gestation who gave birth in our institution between March 2013 and December 2015. Maternal serum and cord blood 25(OH)D levels were analyzed at the day of delivery. Maternal 25(OH)D levels did not differ significantly in women with PCOS and without PCOS (p = 0.998), nor did the 25(OH)D levels of their respective offspring (p = 0.692). 25(OH)D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) was found in 26.9% and 22.5% of women with and without PCOS (p = 0.430). There was a strong positive correlation between maternal and neonatal 25(OH)D levels in both investigated groups (r >= 0.79, p < 0.001). Linear regression estimates of cord blood 25(OH)D levels are about 77% of serum 25(OH)D concentrations of the mother. Compared to healthy controls, the risk for maternal complications was increased in PCOS women (48% vs. 65%; p = 0.009), while there was no significant difference in neonatal complications (22% and 22%; p = 1.0). However, 25(OH)D levels were similar between mothers and infants with and without perinatal complications. Although the share of women and infants with 25(OH)D deficiency was high in women with PCOS and without PCOS, it seems that the incidence of adverse perinatal outcome was not affected. The long-term consequences for mothers and infants with a 25(OH)D deficiency have to be investigated in future studies.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Background: To investigate insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism in pregnant lean and overweight polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients vs. lean and overweight controls without PCOS. Method(s): Prospective cohort study on 67 pregnant women (31 with PCOS and 36 controls, subdivided into overweight or obese and normal weight). All women underwent a 2h-OGTT including glucose, insulin, and C-peptide in early-and mid-gestation and were followed-up until delivery. Result(s): Insulin sensitivity and glucometabolic parameters were comparable between PCOS patients and controls, whereas marked differences were observed between overweight/obese and lean mothers. Impaired whole-body insulin sensitivity at early pregnancy is mainly a consequence of higher BMI (body mass index; p < 0.001) compared to PCOS (p = 0.216), whereby no interaction between overweight/obesity and PCOS was observed (p = 0.194). Moreover, overweight was significantly associated with gestational diabetes (p = 0.0003), whereas there were no differences between women with and without PCOS (p = 0.51). Birth weight was inversely related to whole-body insulin sensitivity (rho = -0.33, p = 0.014) and positively associated with higher pregestational BMI (rho = 0.33, p = 0.012), whereas there was no association with PCOS. Conclusion(s): Impaired insulin action was mainly a consequence of overweight rather than PCOS. Our data suggest that overweight is more relevant than PCOS for the effects on insulin sensitivity and impaired glucose metabolism.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Objective: To assess the association between hCG day progesterone levels and subsequent frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycle outcome in infertile women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): Data of 178 women who underwent FET at a university-based infertility clinic between January 2016 and December 2019 were reviewed. The study group consisted of women who had progesterone elevation (PE) during fresh controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) cycle. A sub-group analysis was also performed in PCOS and non-PCOS patients. Result(s): There were no differences in clinical pregnancy (47.7 % vs. 50.7 %, p = 0.729), miscarriage (15.9 % vs. 22.4 %, p = 0.359), and live birth rates (27.3 % vs. 23.9 %, p = 0.652) following FET between women with and without PE in the fresh cycle. The results remained non-significant regarding the clinical pregnancy (46.7 % vs. 53.4 %, p = 0.549), miscarriage (13.3 % vs. 27.6 %, p = 0.133), and live birth rates (26.7 % vs. 19.0 %, p = 0.408) in participants with PCOS (n = 88). Conclusion(s): hCG day progesterone level in the fresh COS cycle does not have a significant impact on the subsequent FET cycle neither in PCOS nor in non-PCOS women.Copyright © 2021

N2  - The present study aimed to assess whether women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) >=35 years age undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles experienced a higher cumulative live birth rate (CLBR) over a two-year period compared with age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched patients with tubal factor infertility. Through propensity score matching (PSM) approach, the authors retrospectively analyzed the IVF/ICSI outcomes of 263 PCOS patients (35-46 years of age [mean, 37 years]) and 526 age- and BMI-matched tubal factor controls two years after oocyte retrieval. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to explore factors influencing cumulative live birth. Women with PCOS exhibited better ovarian reserve and response, and higher CLBR in two years compared with age- and BMI-matched controls (CLBR: 55.51% in PCOS vs. 38.02% in control, p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of transferable embryos and antral follicle counts were both significant independent factors predicting cumulative live birth after adjusting for female age, female body mass index, percentage of transferred blastocysts, number of embryos transferred per embryo-transfer cycle, diagnosis of PCOS and freeze-all cycles (p<0.001, p=0.045). Women with PCOS >= 35 years of age demonstrated a higher CLBR over two years compared with age- and BMI-matched controls. This could be explained by favorable oocyte reserve and more available embryos compared with controls, which overcome the compromised oocyte quality in aged PCOS patients.© Copyright © 2021 Mai, Liu, Pan, Li, Huang, Chen and Yang.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex syndrome with clinical features of an endocrine/metabolic disorder. Various metabolites show significant association with PCOS; however, studies comparing the metabolic profile of pregnant women with and without PCOS are lacking. In this study, metabolomics analysis of blood samples collected from PCOS women and age and BMI matched controls in the second trimester of pregnancy was performed to identify metabolic differences between the two groups and determine their association with pregnancy outcome. Method(s): Sixteen PCOS and fifty-two healthy women in their second trimester underwent targeted metabolomics of plasma samples using tandem mass spectrometry with the Biocrates MxP Quant 500 Kit. Linear regression models were used to identify the metabolic alterations associated with PCOS, followed by enrichment and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses to determine the best indicators of pregnancy outcomes. Result(s): PCOS women had lower birth weight babies compared to healthy controls. As a group, systolic blood pressure (SBP) at both second trimester and at delivery negatively correlated with birth weight. Regression models indicated significant increases in the triglycerides C20:4_C34:3 and C18:2_C38:6 in the PCOS group [false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05]. Enrichment analysis revealed significant elevations in triglycerides containing arachidonic acid, linoleic acid and palmitic acid in the PCOS group. A number of indicators of baby birth weight were identified including SBP at delivery, hexosylceramide (d18:2/24:0), ceramide (d18.0/24.1) and serine, with an AUC for all predictors combined for low birth weight (<=2500grams) of 0.88 (95%CI: 0.75-1.005, p<0.001). Conclusion(s): PCOS pregnancies resulted in babies with a lower birth weight, marked by a unique metabolic signature that was enriched with specific triglycerides and unsaturated fatty acids. The functional significance of these associations needs further investigation.© Copyright © 2021 Diboun, Ramanjaneya, Ahmed, Bashir, Butler, Albagha, Abou-Samra, Atkin, Mazloum and Elrayess.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the body mass index and neurologic development of 1-2 years offspring born to mothers with polycystic ovary syndrome. Study Design: A case-control study. Place and Duration of Study: Dongyang Women and Children's Hospital, Zhejiang Province, China, between June 2018 and January 2019. Methodology: A total of 145 children were included in the final analysis, including 16 daughters of mothers with PCOS, 13 sons of mothers with PCOS, 55 daughters of mothers without PCOS and 61 sons of mothers without PCOS. Developmental assessments for each child were conducted, including anthropometric measurements and ability developments using the Denver developmental screening test. Result(s): The body mass index of children was significantly lower in polycystic ovary syndrome group than control group (p=0.022). Children of mothers with polycystic ovary syndrome and control group had no significant differences in the outcomes of the Denver developmental screening test (all p >0.05). Conclusion(s): Maternal polycystic ovary syndrome may affect body mass index of offspring aged 1-2 years and had no negative effects on neurologic development. However, this conclusion may be limited due to the small sample size.Copyright © 2021 College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan. All rights reserved.

N2  - Context: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors reduce weight and improve insulin sensitivity via different mechanisms. Objective(s): The efficacy of once-weekly exenatide (EQW) and dapagliflozin (DAPA) alone and coadministered (EQW/DAPA), DAPA/extended-release (ER) metformin (DAPA/MET), and phentermine topiramate extended release (PHEN/TPM) on metabolic parameters, body composition, and sex hormones were examined in obese women with PCOS. Method(s): Nondiabetic women (n=119; aged 18-45 years) with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 and less than 45 and polycystic ovary syndrome (National Institutes of Health criteria) were randomly assigned in a single-blinded fashion to EQW (2 mg weekly); DAPA (10 mg daily), EQW/DAPA (2 mg weekly/10 mg daily), DAPA (10 mg)/MET (2000 mg XR daily), or PHEN (7.5 mg)/TPM (46 mg ER daily) treatment for 24 weeks. Study visits at baseline and 24 weeks included weight, blood pressure (BP), waist (WC) measures, and body composition evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted to assess glycemia and mean blood glucose (MBG), and compute insulin sensitivity (SI) and secretion (IS) measures. Sex steroids, free androgen index (FAI), and lipid profiles were measured in the fasting sample. Result(s): EQW/DAPA and PHEN/TPM resulted in the most loss of weight and total body fat by DXA, and WC. Despite equivalent reductions in BMI and WC with PHEN/TPM, only EQW/DAPA and EQW resulted in significant improvements in MBG, SI, and IS. Reductions in fasting glucose, testosterone, FAI, and BP were seen with all drugs. Conclusion(s): Dual therapy with EQW/DAPA was superior to either alone, DAPA/MET and PHEN/TPM in terms of clinical and metabolic benefits in this patient population.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - Objectives: To investigate the changes in body fat distribution and predicting factors of these changes in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with obesity, after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Method(s): This study consecutively enrolled 153 patients with obesity aged 18-45 years (83 with PCOS and 70 control patients) who underwent LSG from May 2013 to September 2020 at the Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, with a 12-month follow-up. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was used to assess body fat distribution. Result(s): The percentage of fat mass loss in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) region (55.08%) was more than that in any other body regions at 12 months post-surgery in the PCOS group yet insignificant. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at baseline and DELTA HOMA-IR were only negatively correlated with the variations in VAT mass and volume at 3 months post-surgery in the PCOS group. Logistic regression analysis showed that HOMA-IR <6.65 was an independent predictive factor for the changes in VAT mass and volume at 3 months post-surgery in the PCOS group. Conclusion(s): In this study, the percentage loss of fat mass was greater in the VAT region than in any other body regions in all patients. The rate of VAT decrease in the PCOS group was higher than that in the control group yet insignificant. Compared with control patients, HOMA-IR at baseline was an independent risk factor for the changes in VAT mass and volume at 3 months post-surgery in patients with PCOS. Key Points: * The percentage loss of fat mass was greater in the VAT region than in any other body regions in all patients. * The rate of VAT decrease in the PCOS group was higher than that in the control group yet insignificant. * HOMA-IR at baseline was an independent risk factor for the changes of VAT mass in patients with PCOS.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. Oxidative stress (OS), which plays an important role in determining the developmental competence of an oocyte, may be involved in understanding infertility and poor outcomes cycles in PCOS women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Objective(s): To measure OS biomarkers in the follicular fluid of PCOS women undergoing IVF. Material(s) and Method(s): In this cross-sectional study, 100 women with PCOS (n = 43) and tubal factor (n = 57) undergoing IVF, who were referred to a tertiary medical center between January 2016 and September 2017 were enrolled. OS markers like reactive oxygen species (ROS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and 8-Isoprostane (8-IP) were tested in the follicular fluid and various IVF outcomes in the form of oocytes retrieved, fertilized, cleavage rate, grading of embryos and pregnancy outcomes were compared between the two groups. Result(s): The results indicated that the levels of ROS, TAC, and 8-IP were higher in the PCOS group compared to the tubal group (p = 0.21, p = 0.95, and p < 0.05, respectively). Biomarkers based on the number of retrieved oocytes, cleavage rate, and grades of embryos did not differ significantly in the two groups. The median ROS, TAC, and 8-IP were not significantly different in the two groups in relation to the pregnancies, although the 8-IP levels were significantly raised in the PCOS women who had a miscarriage (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): This study concluded the possible role of OS in PCOS women with increased higher level of 8-IP biomarker as a potential biomarker that needs further evaluation.Copyright © Gongadashetti et al.

N2  - Background: There is limited evidence on the impact of bariatric surgery (BS) on reproductive outcomes in the general population and specifically in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) or the effect of different BS techniques. Purpose(s): The study aims to investigate the impact of BS on fertility, pregnancy, and newborn outcomes in reproductive age women who have undergone BS and the outcomes according to surgical procedure and PCOS diagnosis. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a retrospective, descriptive, cross-sectional study performed in women from 18-39 years undergoing BS in our centre from January 2005 to December 2010. We performed a telephone interview including a structured reproductive health survey on fertility, pregnancy, and offspring outcomes before and after BS. Result(s): Of the women, 872 underwent BS during the study period, 298 were 18-39 years old, and reproductive data was obtained from 217. Women with regular menstrual cycles increased from 52.9% before BS to 72.9% 1 year after surgery. The percentage of patients with a time-to-pregnancy longer than 12 months was higher after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) (17.8%) compared to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (7.1%; p = 0.02). Menstrual regularity was less frequent in PCOS (n = 43) (26.0%) compared to non-PCOS women before BS (60.1%; p = 0.01), with no differences after surgery. Several perinatal results showed an improvement after BS, with a reduction in macrosomia rate and birth weight. Conclusion(s): BS was associated with an improvement in several reproductive outcomes. Menstrual regularity was especially improved in PCOS women. Further research may clarify the impact of LSG on fertility.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

N2  - The objective of this study was to explore the correlation between cervical insufficiency (CI) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in Chinese women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment. The retrospective study enrolled 2978 women including 1489 with PCOS and 1489 without PCOS, among which 34 women were diagnosed with CI (1.14%). The prevalence of CI in PCOS women was statistically higher than that in women without PCOS. Among those women with CI, 23 cases exhibited PCOS, and those cases had an average gestational age of 26.09 +/- 5.91 weeks at the end of pregnancy, which was earlier than that of women without PCOS, and the pregnancy outcomes were worse than in the non-PCOS group though not statistically significant. Multivariable logistic regression showed that PCOS status (odds ratio: 2.050, 95% confidence interval: 1.009-4.206) were associated with increased risk of CI. Our study revealed that among those Chinese women who conceived by ART treatment, the prevalence of CI in women with PCOS was higher than that in women without PCOS. Co-morbidity of CI with polycystic ovarian syndrome negatively impacts prognosis.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Women with PCOS have a higher rate of adverse obstetrical outcomes than women without PCOS. What the results of this study add? Women with PCOS were more likely to have pregnancies complicated with CI. Co-morbidity of cervical incompetence with PCOS negatively impacts prognosis. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Given these results, close surveillance of cervical changes during the second trimester in women with PCOS is necessary for reducing the risk of miscarriage related to CI.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Context: Up to 40% of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have prediabetes; an optimal pharmacotherapy regimen for diabetes prevention in PCOS is yet to be established. Objective(s): To evaluate clinical efficacy of exenatide (EX), metformin (MET), or combination (COM) for prediabetes in PCOS. Design(s): Randomized, open-label, parallel-group controlled trial. Setting(s): Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. Patient(s): PCOS with prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and/or 2 hour post glucose 7.8-11.0 mmol/L on oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]). A total of 150 out of 183 eligible enrollees completed the study. Intervention(s): EX (10-20mug daily), MET (1500-2000 mg daily), or COM (EX plus MET) for 12 weeks. Main Outcome Measure(s): Sustained remission rate of prediabetes (primary endpoint, a normal OGTT after 12 weeks of treatment followed by 12 weeks of washout on no drug treatment) along with anthropometric, hormonal, metabolic, and pancreatic beta-cell function parameters (secondary endpoints) and potential mechanisms were assessed. Result(s): Impaired glucose tolerance was found the dominant prediabetes phenotype. Overall sustained prediabetes remission rate was 50.7%. Remission rate of COM group (64%, 32/50) or EX group (56%, 28/50) was significantly higher than that of the MET group (32%, 16/50) (P = .003 and. 027, respectively). EX was associated with superior suppression of 2-hour glucose increment in OGTT. A 2-step hyperglycemic clamp study revealed that EX had led to higher postprandial insulin secretion than MET, potentially explaining the higher remission rate. Conclusion(s): Compared with MET monotherapy, EX or COM achieved higher rate of remission of prediabetes among PCOS patients by improving postprandial insulin secretion.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - Objective: To examine the effects of common treatments for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) on a panel of hormones (reproductive/metabolic). Design(s): Secondary analysis of blood from a randomized controlled trial of three 16-week preconception interventions designed to improve PCOS-related abnormalities: continuous oral contraceptive pills (OCPs, N = 34 subjects), intensive lifestyle modification (Lifestyle, N = 31), or a combination of both (Combined, N = 29). Material(s) and Method(s): Post-treatment levels of activin A and B, inhibin B, and follistatin (FST), as well as Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2), glucagon, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and 2, and oxyntomodulin were compared to baseline, and the change from baseline in these parameters were correlated with outcomes. Result(s): Oral contraceptive pill use was associated with a significant suppression in activin A, inhibin A, and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), but a significant increase in FST. IGF-1, IGFBP-2, glucagon, and GLP-2 levels were significantly decreased. Oxyntomodulin was profoundly suppressed by OCPs (ratio of geometric means: 0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05, 0.18, P < 0.001). None of the analytes were significantly affected by Lifestyle, whereas the effects of Combined were similar to OCPs alone, although attenuated. Oxyntomodulin was significantly positively associated with the change in total ovarian volume (rs =0.27; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.48; P = 0.03) and insulin sensitivity index (rs =0.48; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.64; P < 0.001), and it was inversely correlated with change in area under the curve (AUC) glucose [rs =-0.38; 95% CI: -0.57, -0.16; P = 0.001]. None of the hormonal changes were associated with live birth, only Activin A was associated with ovulation (risk ratio per 1 ng/mL increase in change in Activin A: 6.0 [2.2, 16.2]; P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): In women with PCOS, OCPs (and not Lifestyle) affect a wide variety of reproductive/metabolic hormones, but their treatment response does not correlate with live birth.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Given the adverse effects of either polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or overweight/obesity, one could speculate that patients with both would fare worse than others. We sought to evaluate the relationship between pregravid BMI and pregnancy complications in PCOS patients conceived by assisted reproductive techniques (ART). Maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes of singleton pregnancies after assisted reproduction in women with and without PCOS were compared by pregravid body mass index (BMI, <24.9 vs. >=25 kg/cm2). The study population comprised 185 with a BMI <24.9 kg/cm2 including 39 (21%) with PCOS and 146 (79%) without. We also included 84 patients with BMI >=25 kg/cm2, involving 34 (40.5%) with PCOS and 50 (59.5%) without. PCOS (total 73 patients) was significantly more common among overweight/obese patients, OR 2.5 (95% CI 1.4, 4.4). Neonates >4,000 g were born only to the overweight/obese mothers in the PCOS group. A higher incidence of gestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, and gestational hypertension was related to pregravid overweight/obesity rather than PCOS. In this specific subgroup of patients conceived after assisted reproduction, pregravid BMI>25 kg/cm2 rather than PCOS itself appears to be associated with GDM and hypertensive disorders.Copyright © 2020 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) without hyperandrogenism on pregnancy-related outcomes. Design(s): A retrospective cohort study. Setting(s): Reproductive Medicine Centre of Tongji Hospital. Population: Women without hyperandrogenism undergoing their first single blastocyst transfers in frozen-thawed cycles were divided into a PCOS group and a non-PCOS group according to the Rotterdam criteria. Method(s): The pregnancy-related outcomes of women with and without PCOS were compared. Propensity score matching and multiple logistic regression models were used to eliminate essential impacts on pregnancy-related outcomes. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pregnancy-related outcomes included pregnancy loss and abnormal perinatal outcomes. Result(s): A total of 4083 women without hyperandrogenism met the study criteria, among whom 557 met the diagnostic criteria for PCOS. Women with PCOS had higher rates of clinical pregnancy (P = 0.035) and cumulative live births (P = 0.023). However, there were no significant differences in the rates of biochemical pregnancy, twins and pregnancy loss between the two groups. Among women with singleton pregnancies, the incidences of preterm birth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, placenta praevia, fetal malformation, macrosomia and low birthweight did not differ significantly between the two groups. The results remained unchanged even after adjustments were made for propensity score matching and multiple logistic regression analyses. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS without hyperandrogenism may achieve higher rates of clinical pregnancy and cumulative live birth than those without PCOS, without increases in their rates of biochemical pregnancy, pregnancy loss or other abnormal perinatal outcomes. Tweetable abstract: PCOS without hyperandrogenism was not associated with abnormal pregnancy-related outcomes.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To examine early and late pregnancy loss in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) undergoing IVF/ICSI transfers. Design(s): Retrospective cohort study. Setting(s): Reproductive medicine centre at a tertiary hospital. Population: We studied women with a positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) after in vitro fertilisation/intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatment from May 2014 to April 2019. Method(s): Odds ratios (OR) for early (<=13 weeks) and late (>13 weeks) pregnancy loss were calculated among women with and without PCOS for plurality of the pregnancy with adjustment for confounding factors. Main Outcome Measure(s): Early pregnancy loss (EPL) and late pregnancy loss (LPL). Result(s): From 21 820 women identified with a positive beta-hCG, 2357 (10.8%) women had PCOS, and 19 463 (89.2%) women did not. EPL occurred in 16.6% (391) of women with PCOS versus 18.3% (3565) in women with non-PCOS (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79-0.99, P = 0.04). After adjustment for age and other confounders, the rate of EPL was not statistically significantly associated with PCOS status (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.80-1.05). Women with PCOS demonstrated a higher rate of LPL (6.4% in PCOS versus 3.6% in non-PCOS, OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.48-2.21, P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, the potential impact of PCOS was less strong (aOR 1.38, 95% CI 0.96-1.98), with BMI and maternal comorbidities also associated with LPL (aOR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.1 and aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.43-3.00, respectively). Conclusion(s): Polycystic ovary syndrome was not independently associated with EPL. There was an increased risk of LPL but this difference was not statistically significant.

N2  - Purpose: Elevated oxidative stress has been proposed as an important factor in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-related infertility. Our study was aimed at simultaneously exploring local and systemic oxidative stress in PCOS individuals and its relationship with embryo quality. Method(s): We recruited 86 PCOS cases and 60 controls. Five representative oxidative stress markers, namely, total oxidant capacity (TOC), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malonaldehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), were measured in both follicular fluid (FF) and serum. Result(s): Women with PCOS compared to normal controls had higher levels of TOC in both FF (10.13 +/- 2.68 vs.7.03 +/- 2.45, P < 0.001) and serum (11.76 +/- 2.92 vs. 8.82 +/- 2.57, P < 0.001). The oxidative stress index (OSI, the ratio of TOC to TAC) was also higher in PCOS cases. They were still significant after BMI adjustment (Padj<0.01). In addition, the serum OSI level was much higher than the FF OSI level in both groups. Correlation analysis showed that the FF and serum TOC were negatively correlated with the high-quality embryo rate on day 3 and the later blastocyst formation rate in the PCOS group (P < 0.05). The correlation coefficient was higher in FF. Moreover, as the regression analysis data showed, the FF MDA level was significantly associated with embryo quality indicators (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): PCOS was accompanied by elevated oxidative stress in both serum and FF. Even though serum oxidative stress was severe, the study suggested that FF oxidative stress contributed more to embryo quality, to which we should give more attention in the future.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the benefits of myoinositol plus metformin versus myoinositol alone in infertile polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) women undergoing ovulation induction cycles. Material(s) and Method(s): Total 116 infertile PCOS women were randomized: Group I (n = 57): metformin (1500 mg) plus myoinositol (4 g) per day; Group II (n=59): myoinositol 4 g per day. Subjects were advised to try for spontaneous conception. Those who did not conceive after three months were given three cycles of ovulation induction. Primary outcome was clinical pregnancy rate after 6 months. Secondary outcomes were improvement in metabolic and endocrine parameters, ongoing pregnancy, abortion and multiple pregnancy rate. Result(s): Baseline demographic, metabolic and hormonal parameters were comparable in two groups. After 3 months of therapy, both study groups had comparable improvement in metabolic and hormonal parameters. After 6 months, clinical pregnancy rate was 42.0% in Group I and 45.5% Group II respectively (RR 0.92(95% CI:0.60-1.43) (p >.05). Side-effects (mainly gastrointestinal) were significantly higher in Group I than group II. Conclusion(s): Myoinositol (4 g) might be used alone as an insulin sensitizer to improve metabolic, hormonal and reproductive outcome in infertile PCOS women. Further studies with large numbers are warranted to confirm the role of myoinostiol as a sole insulin sensitizer.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Objective: To compare the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes after frozen embryo transfer (FET) among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with those among women without PCOS. Design(s): Retrospective cohort study. Setting(s): Tertiary-care academic medical center. Patient(s): In this study, we included 1,167 singletons born to mothers with PCOS and 9,995 singletons born to mothers without PCOS after FET during the period from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2019. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcomes Measure(s): Adverse neonatal outcomes including preterm birth, low birth weight, high birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), and large for gestational age. Result(s): The odds of preterm birth were significantly higher among infants from mothers with PCOS compared with those from mothers without PCOS. The odds of low birth weight and SGA were lower in mothers with PCOS compared with mothers without PCOS in the overall analysis, but the differences in low birth weight and SGA between mothers with and without PCOS did not exist in the subgroup analysis with a normal BMI population. Conclusion(s): The diagnosis of PCOS was independently associated with increased odds of preterm birth among women with singleton pregnancies by FET. In addition, decreased odds of low birth weight and SGA were observed among patients with PCOS, but the increased odds were not observed in the subset analysis of patients with PCOS with normal BMI.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - Objective: To describe the prevalence of female sexual dysfunction in a well-defined polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) population, and to assess the impact of common PCOS treatments on sexual function. Design(s): Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial, oral contraceptive pills and weight loss in PCOS. Setting(s): Two academic medical centers. Patient(s): Women with PCOS (N = 114) defined by the Rotterdam criteria. Intervention(s): Continuous oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or intensive lifestyle modification (Lifestyle) or the combination (Combined) for 16 weeks. Main Outcome Measure(s): Change in Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R) scores after 16 weeks. Result(s): There was no change in total FSFI or FSDS-R score in any treatment group; however, an increase in the FSFI desire domain subscore was observed in the Lifestyle and Combined treatments, indicating improved sexual desire over the 16-week period. Overall, 33 participants (28.9%) met criteria for sexual dysfunction by FSFI criteria (baseline score <=26.55). Among this group, FSFI score improved after 16 weeks of Lifestyle and Combined treatments. There was no change in prevalence of sexual dysfunction in treatment groups at 16 weeks. Use of OCPs did not alter FSFI scores. Conclusion(s): Female sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent among women with PCOS. Our findings suggest that common treatments for PCOS, including intensive lifestyle modification and the combination of intensive lifestyle modification and OCPs, have the potential to improve sexual function in these women; the mechanism for these improvements is likely multifactorial.

Setting(s): Not applicable. Patient(s): Live births at >=24 weeks' gestation from both the PPCOS II (n = 172) and AMIGOS (n = 222) cohorts were evaluated, and those at risk for iatrogenic preterm delivery including placental conditions, fetal growth restriction, multiple gestations, hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, and pre-gestational diabetes were excluded. The final analysis included 118 women with PCOS from the PPCOS II cohort and 146 women with unexplained infertility from the AMIGOS cohort. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Spontaneous preterm delivery. Result(s): In the PCOS population, median AMH overall was 5.5 ng/dL (interquartile range 2.9-9.3 ng/dL). In all, 62% of participants who delivered preterm had AMH levels above the 75th percentile. When comparing clinical covariates between the preterm and term deliveries, women with PCOS who delivered preterm had notably higher AMH than their term counterparts (11.1 vs. 5.4 ng/mL). In the univariate logistic regression analysis, each unit increase in AMH raised the odds of preterm delivery by 14% (odds ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.26). The effect was magnified only after adjusting for age, race, body mass index, smoking status, testosterone, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, and treatment randomization group (adjusted odds ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.49). Unlike in the PCOS population, the unexplained infertility cohort had no significant difference in AMH levels between those with or without preterm delivery (2.3 vs. 2.6 ng/mL). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that women with PCOS and high AMH who conceived after ovulation induction represent a high-risk group for preterm delivery. These data indicate that closer monitoring in the third trimester of pregnancies in PCOS patients with early first trimester AMH levels above 9.3 ng/mL may be warranted.

N2  - CONTEXT: Up to 40% of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have prediabetes; an optimal pharmacotherapy regimen for diabetes prevention in PCOS is yet to be established. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate clinical efficacy of exenatide (EX), metformin (MET), or combination (COM) for prediabetes in PCOS. DESIGN: Randomized, open-label, parallel-group controlled trial. SETTING: Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. PATIENTS: PCOS with prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and/or 2 hour post glucose 7.8-11.0 mmol/L on oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]). A total of 150 out of 183 eligible enrollees completed the study. INTERVENTION: EX (10-20mug daily), MET (1500-2000 mg daily), or COM (EX plus MET) for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sustained remission rate of prediabetes (primary endpoint, a normal OGTT after 12 weeks of treatment followed by 12 weeks of washout on no drug treatment) along with anthropometric, hormonal, metabolic, and pancreatic beta-cell function parameters (secondary endpoints) and potential mechanisms were assessed. RESULT(S): Impaired glucose tolerance was found the dominant prediabetes phenotype. Overall sustained prediabetes remission rate was 50.7%. Remission rate of COM group (64%, 32/50) or EX group (56%, 28/50) was significantly higher than that of the MET group (32%, 16/50) (P = .003 and .027, respectively). EX was associated with superior suppression of 2-hour glucose increment in OGTT. A 2-step hyperglycemic clamp study revealed that EX had led to higher postprandial insulin secretion than MET, potentially explaining the higher remission rate. CONCLUSION(S): Compared with MET monotherapy, EX or COM achieved higher rate of remission of prediabetes among PCOS patients by improving postprandial insulin secretion.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of common treatments for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) on a panel of hormones (reproductive/metabolic). DESIGN: Secondary analysis of blood from a randomized controlled trial of three 16-week preconception interventions designed to improve PCOS-related abnormalities: continuous oral contraceptive pills (OCPs, N = 34 subjects), intensive lifestyle modification (Lifestyle, N = 31), or a combination of both (Combined, N = 29). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Post-treatment levels of activin A and B, inhibin B, and follistatin (FST), as well as Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2), glucagon, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and 2, and oxyntomodulin were compared to baseline, and the change from baseline in these parameters were correlated with outcomes. RESULT(S): Oral contraceptive pill use was associated with a significant suppression in activin A, inhibin A, and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), but a significant increase in FST. IGF-1, IGFBP-2, glucagon, and GLP-2 levels were significantly decreased. Oxyntomodulin was profoundly suppressed by OCPs (ratio of geometric means: 0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05, 0.18, P < 0.001). None of the analytes were significantly affected by Lifestyle, whereas the effects of Combined were similar to OCPs alone, although attenuated. Oxyntomodulin was significantly positively associated with the change in total ovarian volume (rs = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.48; P = 0.03) and insulin sensitivity index (rs = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.64; P < 0.001), and it was inversely correlated with change in area under the curve (AUC) glucose [rs = -0.38; 95% CI: -0.57, -0.16; P = 0.001]. None of the hormonal changes were associated with live birth, only Activin A was associated with ovulation (risk ratio per 1 ng/mL increase in change in Activin A: 6.0 [2.2, 16.2]; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): In women with PCOS, OCPs (and not Lifestyle) affect a wide variety of reproductive/metabolic hormones, but their treatment response does not correlate with live birth.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - Background: The risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes is increased by having a polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis. However, the confounders in previous studies preclude firm conclusions, and further studies are warranted. Objective(s): To investigate whether PCOS affects pregnancy outcomes and complications in infertile women undergoing their first in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, taking into account important confounders. Method(s): We performed a retrospective cohort study of 7,678 infertile women, including 666 women with PCOS and 7,012 controls undergoing their first IVF treatment at a private fertility center from January 2010 to December 2017. Our main outcome was the impact of PCOS on adverse pregnancy outcomes (miscarriage, preterm delivery, pregnancy-induced hypertension) and pregnancy outcomes (live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, implantation rate). PCOS effects were summarized by adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after controlling for maternal characteristics. Result(s): After adjusting for differences in maternal age, BMI, infertility duration, total dose of gonadotropin, serum E2 and endometrial thickness on the day of hCG trigger, number of fertilized occytes, number of embryos transferred, embryo type (cleavage-stage embryo or blastocyst) and quality, women with PCOS had an increased risk of developing unfavorable pregnancy complications, including miscarriage (aOR 1.629, 95% CI 1.240-2.141), very preterm delivery (< 32 weeks) (aOR 2.072, 95% CI 1.133-3.791). For pregnancy outcomes, PCOS was associated with higher clinical pregnancy rate (aOR 1.248, 95% CI 1.038-1.501) and implantation rate (aOR 1.238, 95% CI 1.030-1.489) after adjusting for the above-mentioned confounders. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes after adjusting for differences in maternal characteristics. These women may need more frequent medical consultants and management during pregnancy and parturition.© Copyright © 2020 Liu, Mo, Xiao, Li, Hu, Hong, Wang, Lian, Huang, Zeng and Diao.

N2  - Objective: Oxidative stress may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and poor outcomes after assisted reproduction treatment. It is unclear if systematic oxidative stress is correlated with live birth rate in patients with PCOS after controlled ovarian stimulation. This study aimed to investigate the serum oxidative stress markers on the day of trigger hCG and its relationship with live birth rate in young non-obese women with or without PCOS undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatment. Study design: In this prospective cohort study, 50 patients with PCOS and 50 patients without PCOS aged less than 35 years and undergoing IVF/ICSI between February 2017 and January 2018 were studied. The body mass index (BMI) of all participants was less than 28 kg/m2. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels on the day of hCG were measured. Demographic and cycle characteristics, embryo laboratory data and pregnancy outcomes after fresh embryo transfer were analyzed. Univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze independent variables predicting the live birth rate. Result(s): After conventional ovarian stimulation, the patients with PCOS had higher serum MDA and GPx concentrations (P < 0.03) and lower serum SOD levels (P < 0.03) on the hCG trigger day than the controls. Further, the serum MDA and GPx levels on the trigger day were also positively correlated with the number of good quality embryos (R = 0.26, P = 0.01; R = 0.21, P = 0.04; respectively). However, cycle characteristics, IVF/ICSI outcomes and pregnancy outcomes were comparable between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the rate of good quality embryos (OR 1.04, 95 %CI 1.01-1.06, P = 0.005) and the duration of infertility (OR 0.74, 95 %CI 0.56-0.98, P = 0.04) were predictive factors of live birth rate. The ROC curve analysis showed the AUC for the model was 0.76 (95 %CI: 0.67-0.86, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The data suggest that moderate systemic oxidative stress on the hCG trigger day had no detrimental effects on live birth rate in young and non-obese patients with PCOS after IVF/ICSI treatment.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Context: Restoration of ovulation is quite common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) after surgically induced weight loss. Whether or not this results in an improvement of PCOS-associated infertility is uncertain. Objective(s): To study fertility and gestational outcomes in women with PCOS after bariatric surgery. Design(s): Unicenter cohort study. Setting(s): Academic hospital. Patient(s): Two hundred and sixteen premenopausal women were screened for PCOS before bariatric surgery. Women were followed-up after the intervention until mid-2019 regardless of having or not PCOS. Intervention(s): All participants underwent bariatric surgery from 2005 to 2015. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pregnancy and live birth rates in the PCOS and control groups. Result(s): In women seeking fertility, pregnancy rates were 95.2% in PCOS and 76.9% in controls (P = 0.096) and live birth rates were 81.0% and 69.2%, respectively (P = 0.403). The time to achieve the first pregnancy after surgery was 34 +/- 28 months in women with PCOS and 32 +/- 25 months in controls. Albeit the mean birth weight was lower (P = 0.040) in newborns from women with PCOS (2763 +/- 618 g) compared with those from controls (3155 +/- 586 g), the number of newborns with low birth weight was similar in both groups (3 in the PCOS group and 1 in the controls, P = 0.137). Maternal (17.6% in PCOS and 22.2% in controls, P = 0.843) and neonatal (23.5% in PCOS and 14.8% in controls, P = 0.466) complications were rare, showing no differences between groups. Conclusion(s): Pregnancy and fertility rates in very obese women with PCOS after bariatric surgery were high, with few maternal and neonatal complications.

N2  - Background: The in vitro maturation (IVM) technique has physical and financial benefits, but a lower efficiency and outcome that is still unclear whether it is related to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) itself or the IVM procedure. In this study, we analyzed the clinical and laboratory outcomes of an optimized IVM protocol in patients with and without PCOS. We also discussed the possible reasons for early embryo arrest in the IVM cycle. Method(s): This prospective study involved 58 PCOS patients and 56 non-PCOS patients who underwent mild stimulated IVF combined IVM (IVF/M) cycles. The clinical and laboratory outcomes were compared between the two groups. Also, metaphase II (MII) oocytes were obtained after IVM from the two groups, and in vivo MII oocytes randomly collected from IVF patients were examined for mitochondrial function using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). The aneuploidy rate for arrested cleavage embryos from IVM and IVF oocytes were screened using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Result(s): Mildly stimulated IVF/M resulted in cumulative clinical pregnancy and implantation rates (40.2, 28.7% in the PCOS group vs. 41.9, 36% in the non-PCOS group), respectively. The blastocyst formation rates were comparable (28% vs. 28.2%) in PCOS and non-PCOS groups, respectively. Using LSCM, there was a significant decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential of IVM oocytes compared with the control IVF oocytes (P < 0.001), but no significant difference between the PCOS and non-PCOS groups. The NGS showed that the aneuploidy rates were comparable (75, 75, and 66.6%) in IVM-PCOS, IVM-non-PCOS, and control IVF arrested embryos, respectively. Conclusion(s): The mildly stimulated IVF/M protocol produced acceptable clinical outcomes in PCOS and non-PCOS patients. IVM itself rather than the PCOS condition adversely affected the embryo development through its effect on mitochondrial function, which appeared to be a possible cause for the embryo arrest in the IVM cycles rather than chromosomal aneuploidy.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Objectives: The aim of the study was to update the results of a previous study published 10 years ago and compare the effect on hyperandrogenism of a newer progestin, dienogest (DNG), in a combined oral contraceptive (COC) formulation with ethinylestradiol (EE), with that of COCs containing the same dose of EE in combination with drospirenone (DRSP) and chlormadinone acetate (CMA). Method(s): Sixty women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) aged between 16 and 35 and requiring antiandrogenic contraceptive treatment were randomised to one of three treatment groups: EE 30 microg/DRSP 3 mg, EE 30 microg/CMA 2 mg, EE 30 microg/DNG 2 mg. We evaluated the effects of the three COCs on sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and biochemical markers of hyperandrogenism. Result(s): After 3 months of treatment, serum androgen concentrations were significantly improved in all treatment groups. Serum concentrations of SHBG were significantly increased with all COC treatments (p < 0.0001). Interestingly, DRSP had a greater effect (+218%; p < 0.0001) on serum SHBG concentrations compared with DNG and CMA (p < 0.04 and p < 0.002, respectively). Serum concentrations of total testosterone significantly decreased in all groups (p < 0.0001). DRSP had a significantly greater effect on total testosterone concentrations compared with DNG (p = 0.002) and CMA (p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): Our study showed that DNG exerted an important stimulatory effect on SHBG concentrations, which was less than that of DRSP but greater than that of CMA. Similar results were also obtained for dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and total testosterone.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 The European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 8-10% of women. NIH criteria for diagnosis include chronic anovulation and evidence of clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism. PCOS is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. Our hypothesis is that insulin resistance is increased in fetuses born to women with PCOS. This is a prospective cohort of women who delivered at our institution. Subjects with a body mass index < 20 or >= 50 kg/m2, multiple gestation, and major fetal malformations were excluded. Maternal blood was collected at admission, and umbilical cord blood was collected after delivery. Serum concentrations of insulin and glucose were measured from each sample. The homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated (plasma glucose (mmol/L) x insulin (muU/mL)/22.5). The HOMA-IR from mothers and fetuses with PCOS was compared with mothers and fetuses without PCOS (controls). Mann-Whitney U test was utilized for statistical analysis. Forty-six women and fetal pairs were included; 28 with PCOS and 18 controls. Maternal insulin (20 [7.7-26.5] vs. 6.6 muU/ml [5.1-7.2]; p = 0.005) and HOMA-IR (3.9 [1.6-4.5] vs. 1.1 [0.9-1.3]; p = 0.01) were increased in the PCOS group. There was no statistical difference in fetal insulin, glucose, or HOMA-IR (p = 0.31) in the umbilical artery (p = 0.10; p = 0.34; p = 0.45, respectively) or the umbilical vein (p = 0.13; p = > 0.99; p = 0.31, respectively). Insulin resistance is present in non-diabetic pregnant women with PCOS, however not in their fetuses. This might explain variations in the occurrence of the adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes reported in PCOS.Copyright © 2020, Society for Reproductive Investigation.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: Do oral contraceptives (OCs) containing progestins with low androgenic or antiandrogenic activities have different effects to those containing levonorgestrel (LNG) on clinical, androgenic and metabolic manifestations of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)? SUMMARY ANSWER: The three OCs tested had similar effects on clinical findings of hyperandrogenism (HA), whereas products containing LNG were less effective on androgenic profiles and had detrimental effects on lipid profiles. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Despite data available on the effects of OCs, the superiority of products with low androgenic or antiandrogenic progesterone components in comparison with older products used in women with PCOS has not been clarified. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study is a crossover randomized controlled six-arm trial, with all six arms including two 6-month treatment periods, one period with OCs containing LNG, and the other with one of three OCs containing desogestrel (DSG), cyproterone acetate (CPA) or drospirenone (DRSP). The trial was conducted between February 2016 and January 2018 and enrolled 200 patients with PCOS. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Two hundred women with PCOS (ages 18-45 years) were recruited at the endocrine outpatient clinic of the Research Institute for Endocrine Sciences (RIES) of the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. A blocking or stratification random allocation (block size = 6) using a computer-based random number generator was prepared to assign participants to treatment groups. Both the clinical examiner and data analyst were blinded to participants during the trial. Outcomes of interest, including anthropometric and clinical manifestations and hormonal, and biochemical parameters were assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6 months of each treatment and after the washout period. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: This study detected a higher decrease in free-androgen index (FAI) levels after 3 months of treatment with OCs containing DSG (95% CI:-2.3,-1.0), CPA (95% CI:-2.4,-1.1) and DRSP (95% CI:-2.6,-1.4), compared with products containing LNG (P < 0.001). Use of OCs containing DSG (95% CI:-3.6,-1.5), CPA (95% CI:-3.1,-0.8) and DRSP (95% CI:-3.4,-1.1) for 6 months was associated with more decrease in FAI, compared with products containing LNG (P < 0.001). The study showed that use of OCs containing DSG, CPA and DRSP for 3-6 months was associated with a higher increase of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), compared with products containing LNG (P < 0.001). We also observed more decrease in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels after use of OCs containing DSG (P = 0.003), CPA (P = 0.012) and DRSP (P < 0.001) for 6 months, compared with products containing LNG. Our results showed that the use of OCs containing DRSP for 6 months was associated with more improvement in acne, compared with products containing LNG (P = 0.007). Women treated with OCs containing CPA, and DRSP for 3 months had higher TG and HDL levels and lower LDL levels, compared with those treated with products containing LNG (P < 0.05). After 6 months of treatment, patients treated with OCs containing DRSP had a sharper decline in LDL levels and more increase in HDL levels, compared to those treated with products containing LNG (P = 0.001). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Considering this trial was conducted in women diagnosed with Androgen Excess Society criteria, the results may not be generalizable for mild phenotypes diagnosed using Rotterdam criteria. Other limitations of the study include the high dropout rate, the lack of a gold standard androgen assay and the multiple end points. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results support the views of clinicians, who suggest an OC with a low androgenic or antiandrogenic progestin, if available, to treat PCOS. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was supported by the RIES, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. There are no conflicts of interest.

N2  - The aim of this study was to compare pregnancy, childbirth, and neonatal outcomes in women with different phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with healthy women. A prospective cohort study from the beginning to the end of pregnancy for 41 pregnant women with PCOS (case) and 49 healthy pregnant women (control) was completed. Based on the presence or absence of menstrual dysfunction (M), hyperandrogenism (HA), and polycystic ovaries (PCO) on ultrasound, the PCOS (case) group were divided into three phenotypes (HA + PCO (n = 22), M + PCO (n = 9), HA + M+PCO (n = 10). Pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and lower birth weight among newborns were significantly higher in the PCOS case group compared to the control group especially in the phenotype HA + M+PCO (p <.05). High BMI (beta = 2.40; p=.03) was the strongest predictor of pre-eclampsia in patients with PCOS. High androgen levels (free androgen index) (beta = 13.71, 3.02; p <.05), was the strongest predictor of developing diabetes during pregnancy and reduced birth weight baby, respectively.These results suggest that PCOS, particularly in phenotype HA + M+PCO (p <.05), is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes including gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and reduced weight babies.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Objective: To compare the effects of metformin, rosiglitazone, and their combination in obese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with insulin resistance. Design(s): Prospective randomized controlled trail. Setting(s): Tertiary teaching hospital. Patient(s): Obese Chinese women (body mass index [BMI] >=25 kg/m2) with insulin resistance who fulfilled the Rotterdam criteria of PCOS. Intervention(s): In group 1, 68 patients administered metformin (1,500 mg/day); in group 2, 67 patients administered rosiglitazone (4 mg/day); in group 3, 69 patients administered metformin (1,000 mg/day) and rosiglitazone (4 mg/day) for 6 months, all with the same diet and regular exercise lifestyle recommendation. Main Outcome Measure(s): Average menstrual interval, anthropometric measurements, androgen-related parameters, and metabolic features of insulin, carbohydrates, and lipids, with intention-to-treat analysis. Result(s): The baseline parameters showed no statistically significant differences. After the 6-month treatment, most participants showed an improved menstrual pattern. There were statistically significant decreases in acne scores, weight, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and serum testosterone. The metabolic indexes of insulin, carbohydrates, and lipids were improved obviously compared with the baseline in each group. Among the three groups, the patients administered 1,500 mg/day metformin experienced greater reductions in weight. However, the rosiglitazone users (alone or combined with metformin) showed a more notable decline in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Conclusion(s): Considering the benefits of metformin on weight loss, high-dose metformin (1,500 mg/day) along with lifestyle modification should be recommended for obese, insulin-resistant women with PCOS. Rosiglitazone alone or combined with low-dosage metformin plus lifestyle modification should be considered for the women with abnormal lipid profiles.

N2  - Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting 5-10% of women of reproductive age. It is characterized by chronic anovulation leading to menstrual disorders, and increased infertility. The syndrome can also manifest as hirsutism and acne. Aim of the study: The aim of the study was to compare, over a duration of 6 months, the effects of drospirenone (DRSP) versus chlormadinone acetate (CMA) containing oral contraceptives (OCs) on clinical, hormonal, and metabolic parameters in 120 PCOS women. Material(s) and Method(s): 120 women with the diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam 2003 criteria were recruited to the study. All patients were divided to two treatment groups of OCs, containing: 3 mg DRSP/30 mcg EE (ethinylestradiol) (60 patients) and 2 mg CMA/30 mcg EE (60 patients). Clinical parameters such as hirsutismus and acne were evaluated. Metabolic parameters such as serum insulin, glucose concentration, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also measured. Among hormonal parameters, serum estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free thyroxine were measured. Result(s): The use of both DRSP- or CMA-containing OCs provided similar positive therapeutic effects with regard to clinical, metabolic, and hormonal parameters. Among clinical parameters, like hirsutismus, after 6 months of continuous OC treatment, a statistically significant improvement was observed in both groups: DRSP (p < 0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001). In addition, significant improvement was showed according to acne lesions both after DRSP (p < 0.0001) and CMA treatments (p < 0.0001). Among glucose, insulin levels and HOMA-IR, there were statistically significant higher levels in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.05) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.02, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001). Hormonal parameters such as LH, FSH, prolactin, testosterone and DHEA-S were statistically significant lower in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.01, p < 0,002, and p < 0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.04, p < 0.002, and p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): Further research, however, is needed not only to define optimal duration, and to clarify the effects of treatment on long-term metabolic outcomes, but also to explore different treatment options and possible combined therapies.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).

N2  - Objectives: The aetiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is not particularly mapped; however, a complex interaction of various factors, such as genetic, environmental and intrauterine factors, can be assumed. Experimental animal studies and clinical observations support the hypothesis that developmental programming by excess intrauterine steroid is relevant. The aim of the study was to investigate whether mothers with and without PCOS exhibit different androgen and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels at the end of pregnancy and how maternal hormone levels are reflected in their offspring. Method(s): Between March 2013 and December 2015, we performed a prospective cross-sectional study at the Medical University of Graz. We included 79 women with PCOS according to the ESHRE/ASRM 2003 definition and 354 women without PCOS, both with an ongoing pregnancy >=37 + 0 weeks of gestation, who gave birth in our institution. Primary outcome parameters were the levels of maternal and neonatal androgens (testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione) and AMH at delivery. Result(s): Androgen levels in female offspring of PCOS and non-PCOS women at birth did not differ, while maternal hormone levels differed significantly. Androgen levels in PCOS boys were significantly higher when compared to levels in PCOS girls. Discussion(s): Our findings do not support the hypothesis that maternal androgen excess contributes to elevated androgen concentrations in the female offspring. Nevertheless, the effects of the increased androgen concentrations in mothers on their offspring have to be investigated in future studies.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

N2  - Purpose: To examine the association of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) within a large population of pregnant women in an integrated healthcare system. Method(s): This retrospective study utilized a source cohort of 1023 women with PCOS and 1023 women without PCOS who had a delivered pregnancy within Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Preexisting hypertension was defined by hypertension diagnosis, treatment, or elevated blood pressure prior to 20 weeks of gestation. The development of PIH, including gestational hypertension, preeclampsia/eclampsia, or HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count), was ascertained by chart review. Among women without preexisting hypertension who had a singleton pregnancy, the association of PCOS and PIH was examined using multivariable logistic regression. Result(s): Among 1902 women (910 PCOS) with singleton pregnancy, 101 (11.1%) PCOS and 36 (3.6%) non-PCOS women had preexisting hypertension and were excluded. Of the remaining 1765 women, those with PCOS (compared to non-PCOS) were slightly older (mean age 31.2 versus 30.7), more likely to be obese (39.6% versus 15.1%), nulliparous (63.8% versus 43.4%), and conceive with fertility treatment (54.1% versus 1.9%); they also had a higher incidence of PIH (10.8% versus 6.6%), including gestational hypertension (5.8% versus 3.6%) and preeclampsia or HELLP (4.9% versus 3.0%; all p<0.05). PCOS was associated with increased odds of PIH (odds ratio, OR 1.7, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.2-2.4), remaining significant after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, nulliparity, and fertility treatment; however, findings were attenuated and no longer significant after adjusting for weight status (OR 1.1, CI 0.7-1.7). Maternal PCOS was also associated with preeclampsia/HELLP in unadjusted but not adjusted (OR 1.0, CI 0.5-1.9) analyses. Nulliparity and higher prepregnancy BMI were associated with PIH in both groups. Conclusion(s): Compared to women without PCOS, women with PCOS are at higher risk for PIH but this association was not independent of weight status.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the factors that are associated with the effect of metformin on endothelial dysfunction in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Patients and Methods: From March 24, 2014, to November 18, 2016, 48 women with PCOS were randomly assigned to 1500 mg/d of metformin (N=29) or no treatment (N=13) for 3 months; 42 patients (29 in the initial treatment group and 13 in the no treatment group) completed the study. Study variables were measured at baseline and after 3 months. Participants who did not receive metformin initially were then treated with metformin for another 3 months, and study variables were measured again. Endothelial function was measured as reactive hyperemia-peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) from the index finger. Result(s): The age and baseline endothelial function (mean +/- SD) of the participants were 32.7+/-6.9 years and 1.8+/-0.5, respectively. No notable change was observed in endothelial function after 3 months with metformin compared with no treatment. However, after stratifying participants who received metformin based on baseline endothelial function, there was a significant improvement following metformin treatment in participants with abnormal baseline endothelial function (1.3+/-0.3 vs 1.7+/-0.3; P<.001) but not in those with normal baseline endothelial function (2.1+/-0.4 vs 2.0+/-0.5; P=.11). Conclusion(s): Metformin improves endothelial function in women with PCOS and endothelial dysfunction independent of changes in glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, or presence of prediabetes. Metformin has a direct effect on endothelial function in PCOS, and measurement of endothelial function can stratify and follow response to metformin treatment in PCOS.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of seven different ratios between two inositols stereoisomers, myo-inositol (MI) and D-chiro-inositol (DCI), in the therapy of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: fifty-six PCOS patients (8 for each group) were treated by oral route using the following formulations: DCI alone, and 1:3.5; 2.5:1; 5:1; 20:1; 40:1, 80:1 MI/DCI ratio. They received 2 g of inositols twice a day for 3 months. The primary outcome was ovulation, the secondary outcome included the improvement of FSH, LH, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), 17-beta-Estradiol (E2), free testosterone, basal and postprandial insulin levels, as well as HOMA index, BMI and menses. RESULT(S): We found that the 40:1 MI/DCI ratio is the best for PCOS therapy aimed at restoring ovulation and normalizing important parameters in these patients. The other formulations were less effective. In particular, a decreased activity was observed when the 40:1 ratio was modified in favour of DCI. CONCLUSION(S): Our data demonstrated that DCI activity is beneficial mainly at a specific ratio with MI, whereas the increase of DCI causes the loss of the beneficial effects at reproductive level. These results in humans validate a previous preclinical study with different MI/DCI ratios carried out in an experimental model of PCOS mice.Copyright © 2019 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

N2  - Objective: To study the effects of metformin treatment on bone turnover in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as measured by serum concentrations of bone turnover markers. Design(s): Post hoc study of a previously conducted prospective multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Setting(s): University clinic. Patient(s): The study cohort consisted of 74 non-obese women (body mass index < 27 kg/m2) and 44 obese women (body mass index >= 27 kg/m2) diagnosed with PCOS, with a mean age of 27.6 +/- 4.0 (SD) years. Intervention(s): Randomization to receive metformin or placebo for 3 months. Main Outcome Measure(s): Serum levels of bone formation marker procollagen type I amino-terminal propeptide (PINP) and bone resorption marker carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) at baseline and after metformin/placebo treatment. Result(s): Serum levels of PINP and CTX were similar between the metformin and placebo groups at baseline in the whole study population. Obese women, when compared with non-obese, had lower baseline levels of PINP and CTX. Levels of PINP and CTX were significantly reduced in the whole study population, as well as in both non-obese and obese women after 3 months of metformin treatment, whereas no significant changes were observed in the placebo group. Conclusion(s): Metformin treatment, when compared with placebo, was associated with reduced bone turnover, as suggested by reductions in markers of bone formation and resorption, leading to slower bone remodeling in premenopausal women with PCOS.

N2  - S100A4 is a marker of subcutaneous adipose tissue dysfunction. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is often driven by hepato-visceral adiposity. PCOS phenotypes are normalized more by reduction of central fat with spironolactone/pioglitazone/metformin (SPIOMET) than by oral contraceptive (OC) treatment. We studied whether circulating S100A4 concentrations are high in adolescents with PCOS and, if so, whether they normalize more with OC or SPIOMET. Assessments included circulating S100A4, endocrine markers, body composition, abdominal fat partitioning in controls (n = 12) and girls with PCOS (n = 51; age 15.8 y; body mass index [BMI] 24.5 kg/m2), and 1-year changes in girls with PCOS randomized for OC (n = 27) or SPIOMET (n = 24) treatment. Mean S100A4 concentrations were 71% higher (P < 0.001) in girls with PCOS than in controls and associated with hepato-visceral adiposity (r = 0.47; P = 0.001); S100A4 concentrations decreased more (P < 0.01) with SPIOMET, those decreases associating to hepato-visceral fat loss (r = 0.50; P < 0.0001). S100A4 may become a circulating marker of hepato-visceral fat excess in adolescents with PCOS.Copyright © 2019 World Obesity Federation

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, in overweight/obese PCOS women, which of three distinct treatment modalities achieved the greatest clinical benefits in terms of clinical and body composition outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-three polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) overweight/obese patients were randomly treated for 6 months with: only diet (Group 1, n = 21); diet and myo-inositol (MI) 4 g + folic acid 400 microg daily (group 2, n = 10); diet in association with MI 1.1 g + D-chiroinositol (DCI) 27.6 mg + folic acid 400 microg daily (group 3, n = 13). Menstrual cycle, Ferriman-Gallwey score, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), and body composition by bioimpedentiometry were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months. RESULT(S): Body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumferences decreased significantly in all groups. There was a significant difference between the 3 groups regarding the restoration of menstrual regularity (p = 0.02) that was obtained in all patients only in-group 3. CONCLUSION(S): MI+DCI in association with diet seems to accelerate the weight loss and the fat mass reduction with a slight increase of percent lean mass, and this treatment contributes significantly in restoring the regularity of the menstrual cycle.Copyright © 2019 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

N2  - Background: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Epi-analysis of two previous randomised controlled trials that compared metformin with placebo during pregnancy in women with PCOS showed a significant reduction in late miscarriages and preterm births in the metformin group. The aim of this third randomised trial (PregMet2) was to test the hypothesis that metformin prevents late miscarriage and preterm birth in women with PCOS. Method(s): PregMet2 was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre trial done at 14 hospitals in Norway, Sweden, and Iceland. Singleton pregnant women with PCOS aged 18-45 years were eligible for inclusion. After receiving information about the study at their first antenatal visit or from the internet, women signed up individually to participate in the study. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive metformin or placebo by computer-generated random numbers. Randomisation was in blocks of ten for each country and centre; the first block had a random size between one and ten to assure masking. Participants were assigned to receive oral metformin 500 mg twice daily or placebo during the first week of treatment, which increased to 1000 mg twice daily or placebo from week 2 until delivery. Placebo tablets and metformin tablets were identical and participants and study personnel were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the composite incidence of late miscarriage (between week 13 and week 22 and 6 days) and preterm birth (between week 23 and week 36 and 6 days), analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and admission of the neonate to the neonatal intensive care unit. We also did a post-hoc individual participant data analysis of pregnancy outcomes, pooling data from the two previous trials with the present study. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01587378, and EudraCT, number 2011-002203-15. Finding(s): The study took place between Oct 19, 2012, and Sept 1, 2017. We randomly assigned 487 women to metformin (n=244) or placebo (n=243). In the intention-to-treat analysis, our composite primary outcome of late miscarriage and preterm birth occurred in 12 (5%) of 238 women in the metformin group and 23 (10%) of 240 women in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 0.50, 95% CI 0.22-1.08; p=0.08). We found no significant differences for our secondary endpoints, including incidence of gestational diabetes (60 [25%] of 238 women in the metformin group vs 57 [24%] of 240 women in the placebo group; OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.69-1.66; p=0.75). We noted no substantial between-group differences in serious adverse events in either mothers or offspring, and no serious adverse events were considered drug-related by principal investigators. In the post-hoc pooled analysis of individual participant data from the present trial and two previous trials, 18 (5%) of 397 women had late miscarriage or preterm delivery in the metformin group compared with 40 (10%) of 399 women in the placebo group (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.79; p=0.004). Interpretation(s): In pregnant women with PCOS, metformin treatment from the late first trimester until delivery might reduce the risk of late miscarriage and preterm birth, but does not prevent gestational diabetes.

N2  - Objectives: 1. To study the efficacy of exercise in improving clinical symptoms, anthropometry, glucose tolerance and laboratory profile in women with Polycystic ovarian syndrome. 2. To study the combined efficacy of exercise and metformin on above parameters in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Study design: A Randomised double blinded placebo controlled trial was performed at a district hospital in New Delhi. Sixty six women were included in the study. Block randomisation was done to divide the women into two groups. Women were treated with fixed exercise schedule along with oral placebo in Group A and exercise with oral metformin in Group B. Outcomes stated in objectives were studied and statistically analysed. Quantitative variables were compared using unpaired t-test and Paired t-test within the groups across follow-ups. Qualitative variable has been compared using Chi-Square test /Fisher's exact test. Result(s): In Group A and B significant improvement was noted in menstrual cycles, mean waist circumference, mean waist-hip ratio and body mass index. The mean weight loss was 0.78 +/- 0.19 kg and 1.71 +/- 0.19 kg in group A and B respectively after 3 months. The mean weight loss was 1.08 +/- 0.30 kg and 1.71 +/- 0.19 kg in group A and B respectively. The mean difference in modified Ferriman Gallwey score at 0, 3 and 6 months were statistically significant in both groups. On comparing group A with group B at 6 months, significant improvement was found in menstrual cycle symptoms (55.17% vs 83.33%), mean weight loss (1.08 kg vs 2.5 kg), waist circumference reduction (2.56 cm vs 4.75 cm) and change in mean waist hip ratio (0.02 vs 0.04). Significant changes were noted in OGTT and Serum testosterone level at 6 months in Group B, but not in Group A. Statistically no significant differences were found in acne, acanthosis nigricans and other biochemical parameters. Conclusion(s): Regular exercise should be recommended for the women with PCOS. It results in statistically significant improvement in menstrual cycle pattern, hirsutism, body mass index, weight, waist circumference waist-hip ratio. Addition of metformin resulted in added benefits on menstrual cycle, hirsutism, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, waist hip ratio, serum testosterone and Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the effects of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) and metformin at the end of 6 months of treatment on ovarian stromal blood flow by using pulsed and color Doppler in women with PCOS. Method(s): Women with PCOS (n = 101) fulfilling the Rotterdam criteria were enrolled and randomized to receive either OCP or metformin. OCP was administered in cycles of 28 days (21 pills containing 35 mug of ethinylestradiol plus 2 mg of cyproterone acetate followed by 7 placebo pills) for six cycles and metformin 500 mg was administered twice daily for 6 months. Clinical, anthropometric, hormonal and metabolic parameters and resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) of both ovarian stromal vessels were assessed before and after treatment. Result(s): OCP resulted in a higher reduction in serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and androgens whereas metformin resulted in significant reduction in BMI, waist circumference, and insulin resistance. There was a significant increase in RI and PI of both ovarian stromal vessels with both drugs post-treatment, however, the increase was more prominent in the OCP group. There was a significant negative correlation between changes in LH and testosterone levels with changes in PI and RI in OCP group whereas changes in serum fasting insulin levels negatively correlated with changes in PI and RI values in the Metformin group. Conclusion(s): Treatment with both OCP and metformin leads to a reduction in ovarian stromal vascularization in PCOS women perhaps through different mechanisms and this reduction is more prominent with OCP.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been consistently associated with subsequent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Women with PCOS showed a high prevalence of obesity, which raises the question regarding the role of obesity or PCOS pe ser in development of GDM. In this study we conducted a 2-phase study to compare the risk of GDM and its associated early pregnancy metabolic factors in women with and without PCOS, stratified by pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Method(s): A 2-phase design was used in this study. The initial phase of the study included 566 age- and pre-pregnancy BMI-matched singleton pregnant women (242 with and 324 without PCOS). Risk of GDM and associated early-pregnancy risk factors were explored between women with and without PCOS, after stratification by pre-pregnancy BMI. Stratified analysis was conducted in normal weight (pre-pregnancy BMI < 25 kg/m2) and overweight/obese (pre-pregnancy BMI >= 25 kg/m2) groups. Subsequently, the findings was confirmed in a separate cohort study with 18,106 participants (877 with and 17,229 without PCOS). Result(s): Overall, prevalence of GDM is higher in women with PCOS. Results from the initial study showed that in normal-weight subjects, there is a significant increase in GDM prevalence in PCOS women than non-PCOS women (26.5% vs. 16.2%, p = 0.02). Additionally, normal-weight PCOS women showed higher triglycerides levels (1.51 +/- 0.84 mmol/L vs. 1.30 +/- 0.75 mmol/L, p = 0.02), lower SHBG levels (277.8 +/- 110.2 nmol/L vs. 330.5 +/- 180.4 nmol/L, p = 0.001) and a possible trend towards higher insulin resistance (LogHoMA-IR 0.70 +/- 0.55 vs. 0.57 +/- 0.57, p = 0.05) during early pregnancy. However, in overweight/obese group, no difference in risk of GDM was observed between PCOS and non-PCOS subjects (p = 0.7). Results from the independent cohort confirmed the risk for GDM associated with PCOS in normal weight women (p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): Consistent findings from the 2-phase study showed an increased risk of GDM in normal-weight, but not overweight/obese PCOS women. Analysis of early-pregnancy risk factors of GDM suggested that the pathogenesis of GDM in normal weight and overweight/obese women with PCOS may be different.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of two doses of D-chiro-inositol (DCI) in combination with Myo-inositol (MYO) in women with PCOS undergoing ICSI. This was a multicenter controlled, randomized, double-blind parallel group study with two MYO-DCI formulations for 12 weeks. The study group (SG) was administered 550 mg of MYO + 150 mg of DCI twice daily; the control group (CG) was administered 550 mg of MYO + 13.8 mg of DCI twice daily. The participants comprised 60 women with PCOS undergoing ICSI. At baseline, no differences were found between the two groups regarding age, BMI, HOMA-IR or testosterone levels. The pregnancy and live birth rates were significantly higher in the SG than in the CG (65.5 vs. 25.9 and 55.2 vs. 14.8, respectively) [risk ratio (RR) = 0.4; 95%CI (0.2, 0.79); p =.003 and RR = 0.27; 95%CI (0.10, 0.70); p =.002 respectively]. The risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) was lower in the SG (3.44 vs. 18.5%, p =.07). The combination of MYO-DCI at high doses of DCI improves the pregnancy rates and reduces the risk of OHSS in women with PCOS undergoing ICSI.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - The study was to investigate circulating zinc-a2-glycoprotein (ZAG) concentrations in women with PCOS, and changes in ZAG levels after exenatide or metformin treatment. One hundred eighty-two women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who met the 2003 Rotterdam diagnostic criteria and 150 controls without PCOS were recruited. We partitioned women with PCOS into groups according to body mass index or blood glucose concentrations, determined serum ZAG, anthropometric parameters, metabolic and endocrine indicators, and inflammatory markers, and statistically analyzed the results. Eighty-two overweight/obese subjects of the recruited women with PCOS were then randomly assigned to groups administered either 12 weeks of exenatide injection (10 microg b.i.d.) or oral metformin (1,000 mg b.i.d.). Circulating ZAG levels were determined after 12 weeks of treatment. The results showed that circulating ZAG was significantly lower in PCOS women than in healthy women (p < 0.01). Overweight/obese women and those with higher blood glucose levels had lower circulating ZAG. After 12 weeks of exenatide or metformin treatment, there were significant increases (p < 0.0 p < 0.01; metformin baseline was 47.81 +/- 2.14 ng/mL vs. 55.67 +/- 2.01 ng/mL after treatment, p < 0.0 however there was no statistical difference between the 2 treatments (p > 0.05). Circulating ZAG is closely related to PCOS and could be an important adipokine involved in the occurrence and development of PCOS. ZAG might possibly be applicable as a new observational indicator in the treatment of PCOS.Copyright © The Japan Endocrine Society.

N2  - Background: Empagliflozin is a sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2 inhibitor that improves cardiovascular risk and promotes weight loss in patients with type-2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with obesity and increased cardiovascular risk; therefore, empagliflozin may be of benefit for these women. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of empagliflozin vs metformin on anthropometric and body composition, hormonal and metabolic parameters in women with PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): A randomized open-label study was conducted in women with PCOS who were randomized to either empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 19) or metformin 1500 mg (n = 20) daily for 12 weeks. The main outcomes assessed were changes in anthropometric and body composition, hormonal and metabolic parameters. Result(s): Univariate analysis showed significant differences in weight (empagliflozin: -1.4 +/- 3.2% vs metformin: 1.2 +/- 2.3%; P = 0.006), body mass index (empagliflozin: -1.4 +/- 3.2% vs metformin: 1.1 +/- 2.2%; P = 0.006), waist circumference (empagliflozin: -1.6 +/- 2.8% vs metformin: 0.2 +/- 2.1%; P = 0.029) and hip circumference (empagliflozin: -2.0 +/- 3.0% vs metformin: 1.1 +/- 1.9%; P = 0.001), basal metabolic rate (empagliflozin: -1.8 +/- 2.9% vs metformin: 0.1 +/- 1.9%, P = 0.024) and fat mass (empagliflozin: -0.7 +/- 4.9% vs metformin, 3.2 +/- 5.0%; P = 0.023) between the empagliflozin and the metformin groups. These differences were confirmed in linear regression analysis after adjustment for relevant covariates. There were no significant changes in hormonal or metabolic parameters between both groups. Conclusion(s): There was a significant improvement in anthropometric parameters and body composition, in overweight and obese women with PCOS after 12 weeks of treatment with empagliflozin compared to metformin, although no changes were seen in hormonal or metabolic parameters.Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - The increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in granulosa cells (GCs) may affect the pregnancy results in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In this study, we compared the in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) results of 22 patients with PCOS and 25 patients with tubal factor infertility and detected the ROS levels in the GCs of these two groups. Results showed that the PCOS group had significantly larger follicles on the administration day for human chorionic gonadotropin than the tubal factor group (P < 0.05); however, the number of retrieved oocytes was not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). PCOS group had slightly lower fertilization, cleavage, grade I/II embryo, clinical pregnancy, and implantation rates and higher miscarriage rate than the tubal factor group (P > 0.05). We further found a significantly higher ROS level of GCs in the PCOS group than in the tubal factor group (P < 0.05). The increased ROS levels in GCs caused GC apoptosis, whereas NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) specific inhibitors (diphenyleneiodonium and apocynin) significantly reduced the ROS production in the PCOS group. In conclusion, the increased ROS expression levels in PCOS GCs greatly induced cell apoptosis, which further affected the oocyte quality and reduced the positive IVF-ET pregnancy results of women with PCOS. NADPH oxidase pathway may be involved in the mechanism of ROS production in GCs of women with PCOS.

N2  - Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were treated with the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide to investigate the effect on liver fat content, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial 72 women with PCOS, with a BMI > 25 kg/m2 and/or insulin resistance, were treated with liraglutide or received placebo 1.8 mg/d (2:1) for 26 weeks. Liver fat content was assessed by 1 HMR spectroscopy, VAT by MRI, body composition by DXA, and glucose metabolism by oral glucose tolerance test. Compared with placebo, liraglutide treatment reduced body weight by 5.2 kg (5.6%), liver fat content by 44%, VAT by 18%, and the prevalence of NAFLD by two-thirds (all P <.01). Sex-hormone-binding-globulin (SHBG) levels increased by 19% (P =.03), and free testosterone decreased by 19% (P =.054). HbA1c, fasting glucose and leptin were reduced (all: P <.05), whereas measures of insulin resistance, adiponectin and glucagon did not change. In conclusion, 26 weeks of liraglutide treatment in PCOS resulted in significant reductions in liver fat content, VAT and the prevalence of NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of Diane-35, alone or in combination with orlistat or metformin, on androgen and body fat percentage parameters in Chinese overweight and obese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with insulin resistance. Method(s): A total of 240 PCOS women were randomly allocated to receive Diane-35 alone (D group), Diane-35 plus orlistat (DO group), Diane-35 plus metformin (DM group), or Diane-35 plus orlistat plus metformin (DOM group). Serum TT, DHEA-S, androstenedione, SHBG, FT, FAI, body fat, and body fat percentage were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Result(s): Significant changes in serum TT, SHBG, and FAI were observed in all treatment groups compared with baseline. DHEA-S and androstenedione significantly decreased in the DO, DM, and DOM groups after treatment. FT only significantly decreased in the DOM group. Body fat and body fat percentage significantly decreased in the DO and DOM groups. Compared with the D group, DHEA-S significantly decreased in the DO, DM, and DOM groups (F = 4.081, p = 0.008); SHBG significantly increased in the DOM group (F = 3.019, p = 0.031); and FAI significantly decreased in the DO group (chi2 = 12.578, p = 0.006). There were significant differences between groups in body fat percentage (chi2 = 23.590, p < 0.001). Side-effects were less with orlistat than metformin. Conclusion(s): Diane-35 in combination with orlistat or metformin is more effective in reducing androgen than Diane-35 alone. Orlistat is more effective in reducing body fat percentage than metformin. In addition, orlistat has mild side-effects and is better tolerated compared with metformin.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Introduction: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome are susceptible to depression and anxiety and so may also be at risk for postnatal depression. This study investigates whether women with polycystic ovary syndrome have an elevated risk of postnatal depression. Material(s) and Method(s): Cross-sectional data for parous women (n = 566) were available from a birth cohort. Polycystic ovary syndrome was diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria. Details of reproductive history, pregnancy, birth, and postnatal depression were obtained through structured interview. Comparisons were made between women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome using logistic regression analysis, including the investigation of interactions. Result(s): A positive but statistically non-significant association was found between polycystic ovary syndrome and postnatal depression (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 0.9-2.9). Compared with their counterparts, women with polycystic ovary syndrome were substantially more likely: to have difficulty conceiving (odds ratio 5.2, 95% confidence interval 2.9-9.4), to have conceived with medical assistance (odds ratio 11.6, 95% confidence interval 5.5-24.4), and to have pregnancy complications (gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, or preeclampsia; odds ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.1-3.5). Where women with polycystic ovary syndrome had a history of miscarriage or conceived with medical assistance, the combination interacted (p = 0.06 and p < 0.05, respectively), with over half of such women having postnatal depression. Conclusion(s): Although women with polycystic ovary syndrome may not have an excess risk of postnatal depression overall, those who had suffered a miscarriage or required medical assistance to conceive were at substantially elevated risk. Findings point to vulnerability inherent in polycystic ovary syndrome being amplified, either by stressful experiences on the pathway to pregnancy/childbirth or by specific fertility treatment regimens.Copyright © 2018 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology

N2  - Aim: The aims of this study is to address the improvement in CRP and adiponectin in obese PCOS and non PCOS after bariatric surgery, and to show that obese PCOS women have a slower rate of improvement when compared to obese non PCOS women. Method(s): This is a prospective case-control study evaluating the effect of weight loss by sleeve gastrectomy among obese PCOS patients. Result(s): There was a 36.28% of weight loss among obese PCOS and 33.04% among the control group at 12 months. Both groups showed a significant increase in the adiponectin levels at 3, 6 and 12 months' post-surgery. The rate of increase was higher in the obese non PCOS women (4.93 +/- 1.79-9.79 +/- 3.9) compared to obese PCOS women (5.05 +/- 1.98-7.25 +/- 0.21). The CRP levels decreased with weight loss after the surgery to reach statistical significance at 3 months in obese PCOS group (4.18 +/- 3.94, p = 0.048). Conclusion(s): The degree of weight loss after surgery was effective in lowering CRP and increasing adiponectin levels in PCOS women. However, this improvement was slower compared to obese non PCOS patients. A genetic predisposition to insulin resistance might explain these findings.Copyright © 2018 Diabetes India

N2  - Context: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have increased risk for pregnancy complications, possibly related to pre-existing obesity and excessive gestational weight gain (GWG). Objective(s): To assess the contributions of diagnosis and preconception weight on GWG and perinatal outcomes. Research Design and Methods: Prospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies in PCOS (n = 164) and ovulatory controls (n = 176) from infertility treatment. Main Outcome Measure(s): GWG, birthweight, pregnancy complications. Result(s): From preconception baseline, normal-weight women with PCOS gained 2.3 pounds more during the first trimester (95% CI, 0.3 to 4.3; P = 0.02), and by the end of the second trimester, 4.2 pounds more than controls (95% CI, 0.7 to 7.7; P = 0.02). Women who were overweight with PCOS gained significantly more weight than did controls by the end of the second trimester (5.2 pounds; 95% CI, 0.2 to 10.2; P = 0.04), whereas women with obesity and PCOS and control women had similar weight gain throughout pregnancy. Within normal-weight, overweight, and obese groups, prevalence of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes did not differ between the PCOS and control groups, nor was there a difference in birthweight. Preconception body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with GWG; for every 1-kg/m2 increase in preconception BMI, GWG decreased by 0.62 pounds (95% CI, 20.85 to 20.40; P, 0.001). Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS who are of normal weight or are overweight before conception experience more GWG than do ovulatory controls. Within normal-weight, overweight, and obese groups, rates of perinatal complications do not significantly differ between women with PCOS and controls. Preconception BMI is the strongest predictor of GWG.Copyright © 2018 Endocrine Society.

N2  - The aim of this retrospective study was to examine how a low estradiol/follicle (E2/fol) may be related to in vitro fertilization/ intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI)-embryo transfer outcomes in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and non-PCOS patients, respectively. Between 2013 and 2017, 516 IVF/ICSI cycles (146 cycles in PCOS patients and 370 cycles in non-PCOS patients) with a long gonadotrophin releasing hormone receptor agonist protocol-including 338 involved fresh transfer cycles (89 cycles in PCOS patients and 249 cycles in non-PCOS patients)-were conducted. Outcomes were compared between 5 groups of PCOS patients defined by E2/fol (pg/mL) as follows: A, <140; B, 140 to 210; C, 210 to 280; D, 280 to 350; and E, >350. Non-PCOS patients' outcomes are grouped as well. Whether in PCOS or non-PCOS patients, those in the lowest E2/fol group (<140pg/mL) tended to be younger, and with a greater body mass index (BMI) and antral follicle count (AFC), than the patients in the other groups. Relative to the other groups, Group A showed a lower number and rate of oocytes, higher single pronucleus (1PN) and triple pronucleus (3PN) formation rate, early and advanced abortion rates, but these did not differ significantly from those of the other groups, it perhaps due to the limited sample size. Group A have a higher incidence of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome than the other groups in non-PCOS patients (P>.05). Whether in PCOS or non-PCOS patients, greater BMI, greater AFC, and younger age may favor the phenomenon of low E2/fol. In turn, low E2/fol may reduce the oocyte retrieval rate and increase the risk of 1PN and 3PN formation and abortion.© Copyright 2018 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Context The impact of vitamin D deficiency on the success of ovarian stimulation according to underlying infertility diagnosis has not been investigated. Objective To evaluate the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and reproductive outcomes after ovarian stimulation in women with either polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or unexplained infertility. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Analysis of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. Participants Participants from the Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome II (PPCOS II) RCT (n = 607); participants from the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS) RCT of unexplained infertility (n = 647). Interventions Serum 25(OH)D levels measured in banked sera. Main Outcome Measures Primary: live birth; secondary: ovulation (PPCOS II), pregnancy, and early pregnancy loss. Results In PPCOS II, subjects with vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL or 50 nmol/L] were less likely to ovulate (adjusted OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.99; P = 0.04) and experienced a 40% lower chance of live birth (adjusted OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.98; P = 0.04) than those not deficient. In AMIGOS, no significant association between vitamin D deficiency and live birth was noted. In pregnant subjects from both studies, vitamin D deficiency was associated with elevated risk of early pregnancy loss (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.6; P = 0.05). Conclusions In this investigation of women pursuing ovarian stimulation, the association between vitamin D deficiency and diminished live birth relied on carrying the diagnosis of PCOS and was not observed in unexplained infertility. Given the generally modest success of ovarian stimulation, addressing vitamin D deficiency may prove an important treatment adjunct for many infertile women.© Copyright 2019 Endocrine Society.

N2  - Background. Fetuin-A is a glycoprotein produced in the liver and related to metabolic syndrome; fetuin-A secretion is divergently regulated in different pathological conditions. In girls with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), insulin sensitization results in a more favorable endocrine-metabolic outcome than oral contraception; we assessed whether those differences are underscored by changes in circulating fetuin-A. Methods. Fetuin-A concentration endocrine-metabolic markers and hepatovisceral fat were measured longitudinally in 35 PCOS girls [age, 16 yr; body mass index (BMI), 23 kg/m2] randomized to receive either oral contraception [ethinylestradiol-levonorgestrel (n=18)] or a low-dose combination of spironolactone, pioglitazone, and metformin (SPIOMET, n=17) over 12 months. Healthy adolescent girls (age- and BMI-matched) were used as controls (n=25). Results. Pretreatment fetuin-A serum levels in PCOS girls were lower than those in controls. After 12 months on treatment, fetuin-A raised to control levels only in the SPIOMET subgroup (P=0.009, versus oral contraception); this increase was paralleled by a healthier metabolic profile with less hepatic fat (by MRI); baseline serum fetuin-A as well as the changes over 12 months was inversely related to hepatic adiposity. Conclusions. A low-dose combination of insulin sensitizers and an antiandrogen - but not oral contraception - normalizes fetuin-A levels in adolescent girls with PCOS. This trial is registered with ISRCTN29234515.Copyright © 2018 Marta Diaz et al.

N2  - Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is impaired in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but the effect of treatment with metformin (M) and/or oral contraceptives (OCP) is undetermined. To assess changes in HRQoL during 12-month randomized treatment with M, OCP or M + OCP in PCOS. Ninety women with PCOS were randomized to treatment with M, OCP or M + OCP. HRQoL was evaluated by a PCOS-specific visual analog scale (PCOS-VAS) regarding 1: Facial hair, 2: Body hair, 3: Acne, 4: Irregular menses, 5: Weight and 6: PCOS in general, and Short Form 36 (SF-36). PCOS-VAS1(facial hair) improved during treatment with OCP (n = 23) compared to M (n = 19), and during M + OCP (n = 23) compared to M treatment, whereas changes in PCOS-VAS2-6 and SF-36 scores were comparable between the three medical intervention groups. Pooled data (n = 65) showed improved PCOS-VAS scores during treatment (all p <.05), but changes in PCOS-VAS were unassociated with changes in BMI or FG-scores despite significant weight-loss during treatment with M (-3.0 kg (-10.3; 0.6)) and M + OCP (-1.9 kg (-4.9; 0.1)) and decreased FG-score during M + OCP treatment (median (quartiles)). PCOS-VAS scores improved significantly and to the same extent during treatment with M, OCP or M + OCP.Copyright © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Objective: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of 3 mg drospirenone/30 mug ethinyl estradiol (OC) alone or combined with 1700 mg metformin on metabolic risk factors. Material(s) and Method(s): In this randomized, prospective, controlled study, 87 non-obese (18-30 BMI) women of reproductive age (18-39) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were assigned to control (n = 17), OC (n = 21), combination (n = 20) and metformin (n = 29) therapy groups. Result(s): Adiponectin levels changed -28.27%, -20.37% and 35.78% after OC, combination and metformin therapies, respectively. High sensitive C-reactive protein levels (hsCRP) changed with OC, combination and metformin therapies by 102.32%, 3.2% and -7.14%, respectively. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels decreased 41.34% in the metformin group. Apolipoprotein-B levels changed in a manner similar to changes in hsCRP levels. The homeostatic model insulin resistance index changed significantly between the groups following treatment (p = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Six cycles of treatments with OC alone may cause metabolic variables to deteriorate in non-obese women with PCOS. The addition of metformin to OC may ameliorate some aspects of this effect.Copyright © 2018

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in healthy Chinese women and to investigate whether these outcomes could be decreased in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate (EE/CPA) pretreatment. Design(s): Retrospective study. Setting(s): Medical university. Patient(s): Six thousand healthy women (group A) were selected from 24,566 pregnant women by randomized sampling. Four hundred forty-eight patients with PCOS without EE/CPA pretreatment were assigned to group B, and 222 patients with PCOS with 3 months of pretreatment to group C. All patients with PCOS had biochemical and/or clinical hyperandrogenism and conceived within 3 monthly ovulation inductions using clomiphene. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), premature delivery (PD), and neonatal birth weight. Result(s): The prevalence of GDM, PIH, and PD was higher in group B than in groups A and C (A vs. B vs. C: GDM, 21.2% vs. 35.0% vs. 22.5%; PIH, 6.5% vs. 14.1% vs. 7.7%; PD, 5.4% vs. 8.6% vs. 6.8%). No significant difference was found in neonatal birth weight. After adjusting for age, pregestational body mass index, education level, and employment status, PCOS without pretreatment increased the risk of GDM (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.666; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.340-2.072), PIH (aOR = 1.487; 95% CI, 1.093-2.023), and PD (aOR = 1.522; 95% CI 1.051-2.205), compared with healthy women. No increased risk was found in group C. Conclusion(s): In our highly selected study population, patients with PCOS are more likely to develop GDM, PIH, and PD. Pretreatment with EE/CPA was associated with a lower risk of GDM, PIH, and PD.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

N2  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of orlistat or metformin combined with Diane-35 on anthropometric, hormonal and metabolic parameters in overweight and obese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with insulin resistance (fasting insulin > 10 mIU/L). A total of 240 PCOS women were randomly allocated to orlistat plus Diane-35(OD group), metformin plus Diane-35(MD group), orlistat plus metformin plus Diane-35(OMD group) or Diane-35 (D group). Body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumference, blood pressure, endocrine profile, lipid profile and insulin resistance were assessed at baseline and after 3 months. Significant reductions in waist and hip circumference, serum LH, total testosterone and uric acid were observed in all groups compared with baseline. TG and TC significantly decreased in the OD group. Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index was reduced in the OD (p =.015), MD (p =.001) and OMD (p =.004) groups. Body weight, BMI, systolic BP and HDL-C significantly changed in the OD and OMD group compared with the D group (p <.05). Side effects were less with orlistat than metformin. This study demonstrated that orlistat is more effective in reducing weight and lipid profile than metformin. Besides, orlistat has mild side-effects and is better tolerated compared with metformin.Copyright © 2017, © European Union 2017.

N2  - Context: Hirsutism often occurs in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The efficacy of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) plus antiandrogens in the treatment of its severe expression is controversial due to the lack of randomized, double-blind, long-term studies. Objective(s): The primary outcome was the reduction of hirsutism in PCOS women objectively measured by videodermoscopy on the androgen-sensitive skin areas assessed by the modified Ferriman and Gallwey (mF&G) total score, after 12 months of therapy with OCP + bicalutamide (BC) vs OCP plus placebo (P). The secondary outcomes were to evaluate tolerability of BC and body composition as well as the occurrence of adverse events. Design(s): An experimental, phase 3, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, P-controlled trial. Patients were evaluated at the baseline visit, at 6 and 12 months during treatment, and 6 months' posttreatment. Participant(s): Seventy women with classic PCOS (severe hirsutism, oligoanovulation, and ovarian polycystic ovarian morphology). Intervention(s): Patients received OCP + BC (50 mg/d) or OCP + P for 12 months. Result(s): The repeated measures analysis of variance showed that both treatments were effective in reducing hirsutism: The OCP + BC group had a higher reduction compared with the OCP + P group. No adverse effects were described during treatment except an increase in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein in the OCP + BC group. Conclusion(s): The association of OCP + BC is well tolerated and significantly more effective than OCP alone in treating severe hirsutism. We suggest a combined use of the videodermoscopic index and mF&G to evaluate the effects of androgen deprivation therapy for hirsutism.Copyright © 2018 Endocrine Society

N2  - Context: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and biomarkers can be used to detect early subclinical CVD. Midregional-pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), midregional-pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) and copeptin are all associated with CVD and part of the delicate system controlling fluid and hemodynamic homeostasis through vascular tonus and diuresis. The GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide, developed for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2D including a decrease in particular MR-proANP. Objective(s): To investigate if treatment with liraglutide in women with PCOS reduces levels of the cardiovascular biomarkers MR-proADM, MR-proANP and copeptin. Method(s): Seventy-two overweight women with PCOS were treated with 1.8 mg/ day liraglutide or placebo for 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled RCT. Biomarkers, anthropometrics, insulin resistance, body composition (DXA) and visceral fat (MRI) were examined. Result(s): Baseline median (IQR) levels were as follows: MR-proADM 0.52 (0.45-0.56) nmol/L, MR-proANP 44.8 (34.6-56.7) pmol/L and copeptin 4.95 (3.50-6.50) pmol/L. Mean percentage differences (95% CI) between liraglutide and placebo group after treatment were as follows: MR-proADM -6% (-11 to 2, P = 0.058), MR-proANP -25% (-37 to -11, P = 0.001) and copeptin +4% (-13 to 25, P = 0.64). Reduction in MR-proANP concentration correlated with both increased heart rate and diastolic blood pressure in the liraglutide group. Multiple regression analyses with adjustment for BMI, free testosterone, insulin resistance, visceral fat, heart rate and eGFR showed reductions in MR-proANP to be independently correlated with an increase in the heart rate. Conclusion(s): In an RCT, liraglutide treatment in women with PCOS reduced levels of the cardiovascular risk biomarkers MR-proANP with 25% and MR-proADM with 6% (borderline significance) compared with placebo. The decrease in MR-proANP was independently associated with an increase in the heart rate.Copyright © 2018 The authors.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) encompasses an ovarian and a metabolic dysfunction. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues facilitate weight loss and ameliorate metabolic dysfunction in overweight women with PCOS, but their effect on ovarian dysfunction is scarcely reported. In a double-blind, randomized trial, 72 women with PCOS were allocated to intervention with the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide or placebo (1.8 mg/day), in a 2:1 ratio. At baseline and 26-week follow-up, bleeding pattern, levels of AMH, sex hormones and gonadotrophins were assessed and ovarian morphology evaluated. Liraglutide caused 5.2 kg (95% CI 3.0 to 7.5, P < 0.0001) weight loss compared with placebo. Bleeding ratio improved with liraglutide: 0.28 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.36, P < 0.001); placebo: 0.14 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.26, P < 0.05); between-group difference: 0.14 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.24, P < 0.05). In the liraglutide group, SHBG increased by 7.4 nmol/L (95% CI 4.1 to 10.7) and free testosterone decreased by 0.005 nmol/L (95% CI -0.009 to -0.001). Ovarian volume decreased by -1.6 ml (95% CI -3.3 to 0.1) with liraglutide versus placebo. Nausea and constipation were more prevalent in the liraglutide group. Liraglutide improved markers of ovarian function in overweight women with PCOS, and might be a possible intervention.Copyright © 2017 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

N2  - Objective: This study evaluated associations of basal serum and follicular fluid (FF) anti-Muullerian hormone (AMH) levels with in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. Method(s): This prospective study included 179 consecutive women undergoing IVF, including 59 with PCOS and non-PCOS controls. Thirty PCOS cases had long gona-dotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) and 29 had antagonist (GnRH-ant) protocols. Controls underwent conventional GnRH-a. Associations of basal serum and FF AMH levels with IVF outcomes were assessed. Result(s): Median serum and FF AMH levels, antral follicle count (AFC), oestradiol human chorionic gonadotropin injection day (peak E2), and retrieved oocyte numbers were higher in PCOS patients than in controls (all P < 0.01). Oocyte maturation and high-quality embryo rates were lower in PCOS patients than in controls (P < 0.01), but both groups had similar fertilization, implantation, clinical pregnancy, and newborn rates. Peak E2 was higher in GnRH-ant than in GnRH-a protocols (16.5 nmol/L vs. 12.1 nmol/L, P < 0.05). AMH levels were correlated with AFC in PCOS patients (P < 0.01). Peak E2 and FF AMH levels were independent predictors of oocyte number. Peak E2 predicted the fertilization rate. Conclusion(s): Serum basal AMH levels are predictive of oocyte quantity, but not oocyte quality or IVF outcomes. Serum AMH, FF AMH, and outcomes are similar among protocols.Copyright © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

N2  - Objective: The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of myo-inositol (MYO) on pregnancy rates of patients diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who undergone controlled ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination (IUI). Method(s): A total of 196 infertile patients diagnosed with PCOS and admitted to Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine were included in the study between March 2013 and May 2016. The patients in group 1 (n = 98) were given 4 g MYO and 400 mug folic acid before and during ovulation induction. The patients undergone controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) with recombinant FSH and IUI. The patients in group 2 (n = 98), were given recombinant FSH directly and 400 mug folic acid. The primary outcome measure of this study was the clinical pregnancy rate. Result(s): In group 1, 9 patients conceived spontaneous pregnancy. During COH + IUI treatment three cycles were canceled in group 1 and 8 cycles in group 2. Total rFSH dose and cycle duration were significantly lower and clinical pregnancy rates were higher in group 1. The pregnancy rate for group 1 was %18.6 and for group 2 was %12.2. Conclusions: This study shows that MYO should be considered in the treatment of infertile PCOS patients. MYO administration increases clinical pregnancy rates, lowers total rFSH dose and the duration of the ovulation induction.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Purpose: Obesity in fertile women has negative effect on fertility. Anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) represents a good index of fertility, and it is considered a marker of ovarian reserve and of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) gravity. Previous studies evaluated the relationship between obesity and AMH with contradictory results. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between obesity and AMH and the changes of AMH in obese women in reproductive age submitted to bariatric surgery. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-five obese patients between 18 and 39 years with (29 patients) and without PCOS (26 patients) were compared with a control group of normal weight women with (24 patients) and without PCOS (19 patients). Fourteen obese women with PCOS and 18 without PCOS underwent to bariatric surgery. Serum AMH, testosterone, androstenedione, and DHEAS were performed in all patients before and 1 year after surgical intervention. Result(s): AMH was significantly higher in the PCOS groups (p < 0.001), both in obese (5.84 +/- 3.94 ng/ml) and non-obese women (7.35 +/- 4.39 ng/ml). AMH was positively related to testosterone (p < 0.0001), androstenedione (p = 0.0005), and DHEAS (p = 0.003). After bariatric surgery, AMH levels were reduced in the both PCOS (p = 0.02) and non-PCOS group (p = 0.04). Conclusion(s): AMH levels are elevated in PCOS patients regardless of the body weight. Bariatric surgery is effective in the normalization of AMH levels (a possible indirect marker of better fertility) only in obese patients with PCOS.Copyright © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Background Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) affects up to 18% of reproductiveaged women with increased risks of cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolic disease, related to metabolic and hormonal features, obesity and an apparent hypofibrinolytic state, possibly exacerbated by current PCOS treatments. Objective To investigate and comparehaemostatic impacts of common pharmacological treatments and explore relationships with hormonal and metabolic variables in PCOS. Patients/Methods This mechanistic sub-study using biobanked samples from a 6-month randomized comparative trial of pharmacological treatments assessed pro-And anti-Thromboticmarkers and overall haemostatic activity. Overweight women ofmean age 33.9 +/- 6.7 years andmean BMI (bodymass index) of 36.5 +/- 7.0 kg/m2 with PCOS (n = 60) were randomized to eithermetformin, higher-dose oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or low-dose OCP + spironolactone (OCP + S). Primary outcome measures included changes in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (PF1 and 2), plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) and thrombin generation (TG). Results PAI-1 activity fell in all groups, ADMA fell in higher-dose OCP, PF1 and 2 increased with metformin and higher-dose OCP, TG rose and tPA fell in both OCP groups, plasminogen increased in all and TAFI increased after higher-dose OCP. Conclusion Endothelial function (primary haemostasis) improved with higher dose with some improvement in low-dose OCP + S and metformin. Aberrant coagulation was noted in both OCP groups, but not with metformin. Fibrinolysis was reduced with higher-dose OCP. Our work suggests an additional dimension of treatment (haemostatic system effects) that favours metformin treatment over the OCP in PCOS.Copyright © 2017 Schattauer.

N2  - Context: Weight loss remains one of the most important arms in obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Further studies are needed to identify the best treatment. Objective(s): To evaluate the effects of exenatide (EXE) on reproductive and metabolic function in overweight/obese (OW/OB) PCOS. Design(s): This is a 24-week open-label prospective, randomized, clinical study. Patients and Measurements: This study randomized 176 OW/OB women diagnosed with PCOS to receive either EXE 10 mug BID (n = 88) or metformin (MET) 1000 mg BID (n = 88) for the first 12 weeks. Then all patients were treated with MET alone during the second 12 weeks. We observed metabolic parameters at 0 and 12 weeks, and then tracked the rate of pregnancy during the second 12 weeks. Result(s): After the first 12 weeks of intervention, compared with MET, subjects who received EXE had significantly decreased weight (4.29 +/- 1.29 kg vs 2.28 +/- 0.55 kg, P <.001) and total fat% (4.67 +/- 0.09% vs 1.11 +/- 0.32%, P <.001), improved the homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance (1.30 +/- 0.58 vs 0.59 +/- 0.12, P <.001) and increased the menstrual frequency ratio (0.62 +/- 0.12 vs 0.37 +/- 0.01, P <.001). During the second 12 weeks, the rate of natural pregnancy of EXE-treated patients was significantly higher than MET-treated patients (43.60% vs 18.70%, P <.05). Conclusion(s): Short-term EXE therapy was linked to significant weight loss and central adiposity reduction, which may further explain the improvements in insulin resistance, inflammatory marker and menstrual cycle, which may contribute to increasing pregnancy rates in OW/OB women with PCOS.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - The early miscarriage rate is reported to be higher in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared with non-PCOS patients. However, whether PCOS is an independent risk factor for early miscarriage is still controversial; to what extent embryonic aneuploidy accounts for miscarriages of PCOS is still unknown. In this 1:3 matched-pair study, 67 lean PCOS patients and 201 controls matched for age, body mass index (BMI) and embryo scores undergoing a single euploid blastocyst transfer in vitrified-warmed cycles were analysed. Clinical pregnancy, early miscarriage and live birth rates were compared. Logistic regression analysis was performed to further evaluate the factors associated with early miscarriage and live birth. Clinical pregnancy rates were 50.7% in PCOS and 55.2% in control groups. Early miscarriage rate was significantly (P = 0.029) increased in the PCOS group compared with controls; non-PCOS patients had a significantly higher live birth rate than PCOS patients, P < 0.001. Further regression analyses showed that PCOS was significantly associated with a higher risk of early miscarriage and decreased chance of live birth. In conclusion, PCOS in women undergoing pre-implantation genetic diagnosis may, independently from BMI and karyotype, increase the risk of miscarriage.Copyright © 2017 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

N2  - Purpose Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an increasingly prevalent disorder in adolescent girls, commonly presenting with hirsutism/oligomenorrhea, commonly treated with an oral contraceptive (OC), and commonly followed by oligoanovulatory subfertility. We tested whether an intervention targeting the reduction of hepato-visceral adiposity is followed by a higher ovulation rate than OC treatment. Methods This randomized, open-label, single-center, pilot proof-of-concept study (12 months on treatment, then 12 months off) was performed in adolescent girls with hirsutism and oligomenorrhea (PCOS by National Institutes of Health; no sexual activity; N = 36; mean age 16 years, body mass index 23.5 kg/m2; 94% study completion). Compared treatments were OC (ethinylestradiol-levonorgestrel) versus low-dose combination of spironolactone 50 mg/d, pioglitazone 7.5 mg/d, and metformin 850 mg/d (SPIOMET). Primary outcome was post-treatment ovulation rate inferred from menstrual diaries and salivary progesterone (12 + 12 weeks). Secondary outcomes included body composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry), abdominal fat (magnetic resonance imaging), insulinemia (oral glucose tolerance test), and androgenemia (liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry). Results SPIOMET was followed by a 2.5-fold higher ovulation rate than OC (p <=.001) and by a 6-fold higher normovulatory fraction (71% vs. 12%; p <=.001); oligoanovulation risk after SPIOMET was 65% lower (95% confidence interval, 40%-89%) than after OC. Higher post-treatment ovulation rates related to more on-treatment loss of hepatic fat (r2 =.27; p <.005). Visceral fat and insulinemia normalized only with SPIOMET; androgenemia normalized faster with OC but rebounded more thereafter. Body weight, lean mass, and abdominal subcutaneous fat mass remained stable in both groups. Conclusions Early SPIOMET treatment for PCOS normalized post-treatment ovulation rates more than OC. Focusing PCOS treatment on early reduction of hepato-visceral fat may prevent part of later oligoanovulatory subfertility.Copyright © 2017 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

N2  - Introduction: Both women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and women with twin pregnancies have increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of PCOS and maternal androgen levels on the outcome of dichorionic twin pregnancy. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective study of 360 women with dichorionic twin pregnancies: 72 women with PCOS from a fertility clinic (years 1997-2010) and 288 women without PCOS from a hospital cohort (years 2005-2007). The obstetrical outcome was extracted from Danish National registers and supplemented by patient file data. In all, 65% of the PCOS group had a registered prepregnancy androgen level and these were stratified into normoandrogenic and hyperandrogenic women. The groups were compared by multiple regression analysis adjusting for mode of conception and prepregnancy body mass index. Result(s): We found no overall impact of PCOS on the pregnancy outcome; the risks of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and preterm delivery were comparable within the groups. However, five deliveries in the PCOS group compared with two in the control group occurred before gestational week 28. No difference in the obstetrical outcome between hyperandrogenic and normoandrogenic women was found. The body mass index in the PCOS population was lower than in the non-PCOS, possibly reflecting a higher socioeconomic status and a healthier lifestyle, which may underestimate the impact of a PCOS diagnosis. Conclusion(s): Neither PCOS nor maternal androgen levels confer additional risks to the outcome of dichorionic twin pregnancies of normal weight women.Copyright © 2017 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology

N2  - Objective: We aimed to compare a combined oral contraceptive (COC) plus the antiandrogen spironolactone with the insulin sensitizer metformin in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): We conducted a randomized, parallel, open-label, clinical trial comparing COC (30microg of ethinylestradiol and 150microg of desogestrel) plus spironolactone (100mg/day) with metformin (850mg b.i.d.) for one year in women with PCOS (EudraCT2008-004531-38). Method(s): The composite primary outcome included efficacy (amelioration of hirsutism, androgen excess and menstrual dysfunction) and cardiometabolic safety (changes in the frequencies of disorders of glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia and hypertension). A complete anthropometric, biochemical, hormonal and metabolic evaluation was conducted every three months and data were submitted to intention-to-treat analyses. Result(s): Twenty-four patients were assigned to COC plus spironolactone and 22 patients to metformin. Compared with metformin, COC plus spironolactone caused larger decreases in hirsutism score (mean difference 4.6 points, 95% CI: 2.6-6.7), total testosterone (1.1nmol/L, 0.4-1.7), free testosterone (25pmol/L, 12-39), androstenedione (5.5nmol/L, 1.8-9.2) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (2.7micromol/L, 1.4-4.0). Menstrual dysfunction was less frequent with COC plus spironolactone (OR: 0.06, 95% CI: 0.02-0.23). No differences were found in frequencies of abnormal glucose tolerance (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 0.7-4.4), dyslipidemia (OR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.2-1.8) or hypertension (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.5-2.0). No major adverse events occurred and biochemical markers were similarly safe with both treatments. Conclusion(s): COC plus spironolactone was more effective than metformin for symptoms of PCOS showing similar safety and overall neutral effects on cardiometabolic risk factors.Copyright © 2017 European Society of Endocrinology.

N2  - Context: Due to the central role of metabolic abnormalities in the pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), insulin sensitizing agents have been proposed as a feasible treatment option. Objective(s): To investigate which is the more effective between metformin and myoinositol (MYO) on hormonal, clinical and metabolic parameters in obese patients with PCOS. Study design: Crossover randomized controlled study. Patient(s): Thirty-four PCOS obese women (age: 25.62 +/- 4.7 years; BMI: 32.55 +/- 5.67 kg/m2) were randomized to receive metformin (850 mg twice a day) or MYO (1000 mg twice a day) for 6 months. After a 3 month washout, the same subjects received the other compound for the following 6 months. Measurements: Ultrasonographic pelvic examinations, hirsutism score, anthropometric and menstrual pattern evaluation, hormonal profile assays, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and lipid profile at baseline and after 6 months of treatment were performed. Result(s): Both metformin and MYO significantly reduced the insulin response to OGTT and improved insulin sensitivity. Metformin significantly decreased body weight and improved menstrual pattern and Ferriman-Gallwey score. Metformin treatment was also associated with a significant decrease in LH and oestradiol levels, androgens and anti-mullerian hormone levels. None of these clinical and hormonal changes were observed during MYO administration. Conclusion(s): Both treatments improved the glyco-insulinaemic features of obese PCOS patients, but only metformin seems to exert a beneficial effect on the endocrine and clinical features of the syndrome.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Objective: To study the effects of oral contraceptive pills (OCP), the first-line treatment for PCOS, on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) function (reverse cholesterol efflux capacity) and lipoprotein particles measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in obese women. Design(s): Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (OWL-PCOS) of OCP or Lifestyle (intensive Lifestyle modification) or Combined (OCP + Lifestyle) treatment groups for 16 weeks. Patient(s): Eighty-seven overweight/obese women with PCOS at two academic centres. Measurements: Change in HDL-C efflux capacity and lipoprotein particles. Result(s): High-density lipoprotein cholesterol efflux capacity increased significantly at 16 weeks in the OCP group [0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03, 0.18, P = 0.008] but not in the Lifestyle (P = 0.39) or Combined group (P = 0.18). After adjusting for HDL-C and TG levels, there was significant mean change in efflux in the Combined group (0.09; 95% CI 0.01, 0.15; P = 0.01). Change in HDL-C efflux correlated inversely with change in serum testosterone (rs = -0.21; P = 0.05). In contrast, OCP use induced an atherogenic low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) profile with increase in small (P = 0.006) and large LDL-particles (P = 0.002). Change in small LDL-particles correlated with change in serum testosterone (rs = -0.31, P = 0.009) and insulin sensitivity index (ISI; rs = -0.31, P = 0.02). Both Lifestyle and Combined groups did not show significant changes in the atherogenic LDL particles. Conclusion(s): Oral contraceptive pills use is associated with improved HDL-C function and a concomitant atherogenic LDL-C profile. Combination of a Lifestyle program with OCP use improved HDL-C function and mitigated adverse effects of OCP on lipoproteins. Our study provides evidence for use of OCP in overweight/obese women with PCOS when combined with Lifestyle changes.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Objective To study the presence of several maternal and neonatal complications in a cohort of women with hyperandrogenic as well as normoandrogenic polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and women with PCOS who received different fertility treatments. Design Prospective multicenter cohort study. Setting Hospitals and midwifery practices. Patient(s) One hundred and eighty-eight women with PCOS and singleton pregnancies (study group) and 2,889 women with a naturally conceived singleton pregnancy (reference group). Intervention(s) Observational study. Main Outcome Measure(s) Maternal and neonatal pregnancy complications. Result(s) Women with PCOS had a statistically significantly increased risk of developing gestational diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.07-8.33) compared with the reference group, and their infants were more often born small for gestational age (AOR 3.76; 95% CI, 1.69-8.35). In a subgroup analysis, maternal complications were statistically significantly more often present in women with hyperandrogenic (defined as a free androgen index >4.5) PCOS (n = 76; 40% of all PCOS women) compared with those with normoandrogenic PCOS (n = 97; 52% of all PCOS women) (45% vs. 24%; P=.003); no statistically significant differences were observed between these groups regarding neonatal complications. Conclusion(s) Women with PCOS have an increased risk of maternal and neonatal pregnancy complications, especially women with the hyperandrogenic phenotype.

N2  - Objective To evaluate efficacy with the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor saxagliptin (SAXA), metformin extended release (MET), and combination (SAXA-MET) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and impaired glucose regulation. Design Prospective, randomized, single-blind drug study. Setting Outpatient clinic. Patient(s) Patients (n = 38) with PCOS (aged 18-42 years) and prediabetic hyperglycemia determined by a 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test. Intervention(s) Patients were randomized to SAXA-MET (5 mg/2,000 mg), SAXA (5 mg), or MET (2,000 mg) for 16 weeks. Main Outcome Measure(s) Fasting and mean blood glucose, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and insulin secretion-sensitivity index (IS-SI) by oral glucose tolerance tests. Free androgen index and lipid levels, average menstrual interval, and anthropometric measurements (body mass index, waist circumference, and waist/height ratio). Result(s) The study was completed by 34 patients. Nineteen patients had normal glucose tolerance: 3 of 12 (25%) on MET; 6 of 11 (55%) on SAXA; and 10 of 11 (91%) on SAXA-MET (SAXA-MET statistically superior to MET) at study completion. Body mass index, waist circumference, waist/height ratio, free androgen index, insulin sensitivity, IS-SI, and menses improved in all groups; however, IS-SI and menstrual regularity were significantly better with SAXA-MET vs. MET treatment. Triglyceride, triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and mean blood glucose significantly declined in the SAXA-MET and SAXA groups only. Conclusion(s) This pilot work provides the first evidence regarding the effects of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor alone and in combination with MET in this patient population. Treatment with SAXA-MET was superior to either drug alone in terms of clinical and metabolic benefits in prediabetic patients with PCOS.

N2  - Context: Insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may increase the risk of reactive hypoglycaemia (RH) and decrease glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. The possible effects of treatment with oral contraceptives (OCP) and/or metformin on GLP-1 secretion and risk of RH in PCOS is undetermined. Setting(s): Outpatient clinic. Patients and interventions: Randomized, controlled clinical trial. Ninety women with PCOS were randomized to 12-month treatment with OCP (150 mg desogestrel + 30 mg ethinylestradiol), metformin (2 g/day) or metformin + OCP. Five-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (5-h OGTT) measuring fasting and area under the curve (AUC) for GLP-1, glucose, insulin and C-peptide were performed before and after the intervention period. Sixty-five women completed the study and 34 weight-matched healthy women were included as controls. Main Outcome Measure(s): Changes in GLP-1, glucose, insulin and C-peptide during 5-h OGTT. Result(s): Fasting GLP-1 levels increased during metformin + OCP vs OCP treatment, whereas AUC GLP-1 levels were unchanged during medical treatment. The prevalence of reactive hypoglycemia increased from 9/65 to 14/65 after intervention (P < 0.01) and was more common after treatment with metformin + OCP (increase from 3/23 to 6/23, P = 0.01). Reactive hypoglycaemia was associated with higher insulin and C-peptide levels during 5-h OGTT, but was unassociated with BMI and AUC GLP-1. GLP-1 levels were comparable in PCOS vs controls. AUC GLP-1 levels were significantly lower in obese vs lean patients and were inversely associated with BMI. Conclusion(s): AUC GLP-1 levels were unchanged during treatment. Increased risk of hypoglycemia during metformin + OCP could be associated with increased insulin secretion.Copyright © 2017 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.

N2  - Aims To evaluate the efficacy of exenatide on weight loss, insulin resistance, menstrual periods, metabolic profiles, inflammatory markers, and safety compared with metformin in Chinese overweight/obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. Methods Eighty-two overweight/obese (OW/OB) patients with PCOS were randomly assigned to the exenatide group (10 mug BID sc, n = 41) or metformin group (1000 mg BID po, n = 41) for 12 weeks. The main primary outcomes was mean change in body weight. Results Sixty-three patients completed the study (31 cases in the EXE group and 32 cases in the MET group). EXE treatment was superior to MET treatment in weight loss (P = 0.009), with EXE leading to a significant mean loss of 3.1 +/- 0.2 kg (P < 0.001) and MET leading to a significant mean loss of 1.2 +/- 0.3 kg (P < 0.001). There was a significantly greater effect of EXE compared to metformin with respect to 2hINS, HOMA-IR, INSAUC and ISI (P < 0.001, P = 0.004, P < 0.001, P < 0.021, respectively), with both treatments leading to significant decreases in 2hINS, HOMA-IR and INSAUC (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively); and a significant increase in ISI (P < 0.001). FAI decreased while SHBG increased significantly with both treatments (P = 0.022, P < 0.001, respectively) with no significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05). EXE treatment was superior to MET treatment in reducing hsCRP (P = 0.016) with both treatments leading to a significant increase (P < 0.001). Menstrual periods, mFG score and Rosenfield score were not significantly different before and after treatment for either group (P > 0.05). Conclusions Short-term exenatide treatment possesses a greater efficacy in terms of weight loss, improving insulin resistance and reducing inflammation than metformin. Large-sample and long-term clinical trials, however, are needed to assess exenatide's efficacy and safety in OW/OB women with PCOS.Copyright © 2017

N2  - Insulin resistance (IR) plays a pivotal role in PCOS. Insulin-sensitizer agents such as metformin and inositols have been shown to improve the endocrine and metabolic aspects of PCOS. The purpose of this study is to compare their effects on the clinical and metabolic features of the women with PCOS. Fifty PCOS women with IR and/or hyperinsulinemia were randomized to treatment with metformin (1500 mg/day) or myo-inositol (4 g/day). IR was defined as HOMA-IR >2.5, while hyperinsulinemia was defined as a value of AUC for insulin after a glucose load over the cutoff of our laboratory obtained in normal women. The Matsusa Index has been calculated. The women have been evaluated for insulin secretion, BMI, menstrual cycle length, acne and hirsutism, at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. The results obtained in both groups were similar. The insulin sensitivity improved in both treatment groups. The BMI significantly decreased and the menstrual cycle was normalized in about 50% of the women. No significant changes in acne and hirsutism were observed. The two insulin-sensitizers, metformin and myo-inositol, show to be useful in PCOS women in lowering BMI and ameliorating insulin sensitivity, and improving menstrual cycle without significant differences between the two treatments.Copyright © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Objective: PCOS is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age associated with insulin resistance. Metformin and Myo-inositol being insulin sensitizers improve biochemical parameters. This study was done to compare the effects of these drugs on biochemical profile in PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective, open labeled, randomized, comparative, clinical study was conducted on 60 patients. The patients were randomly divided in two groups of 30 each to receive either of the following two treatments: Group A: Tab Myo-inositol 1g twice daily & Group B: Tab Metformin 500 mg thrice daily for 24 weeks. Biochemical profile was assessed by measuring fasting blood sugar, insulin levels & calculating glucose/insulin ratio and homeostatic model assessment- insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index at baseline and subsequently at the end of 12 & 24 weeks. Serum Lipid profile was also assessed. Result(s): In both the groups, there was statistically significant improvement in insulin resistance. In group A & group B, the values for glucose/ insulin ratio improved from 6.77+/-0.99 to 7.87+/-1.03 and 5.5+/-0.42 to 6.90+/-0.47 respectively at the end of 24 weeks. HOMA-IR values decreased from 4.18+/-0.4 to 2.88+/-0.27 & 4.38+/-0.43 to 2.99+/-0.29 in group A & B respectively over a period of 24 weeks. Lipid profile was also improved in both the groups. However, on comparing both the groups, no statistically significant difference was observed. Conclusion(s): There was a definite improvement in biochemical profile with both metformin and myo-inositol. Thus, myo-inositol can be a new addition in the armamentarium for the treatment of PCOS.Copyright © 2013 are reserved by International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research.

N2  - Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the effect of insulin sensitizers i.e. metformin and myoinositol on anthropometric parameters in patients of the Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): A prospective, open-labeled, randomized, comparative, clinical study was conducted on 60 patients. The patients were randomly divided into two groups of 30 each to receive either of the following two treatments: group A: Tablet myoinositol 1g twice daily. group B: Tablet metformin 500 mg thrice daily for 24 w. Anthropometric parameters were assessed by measuring body weight, Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR) at baseline and subsequently at the end of 12 w and 24 w. Result(s): In both the groups, there was a statistically significant improvement in over a period of 24 w. In group A, the values for weight at baseline, 12 w and 24 w expressed in mean+/-SEM are 63.96+/-.90, 62.33+/-.88 and 61.20+/-.85 while in group B the values were 63.58+/-1.88, 62.26+/-1.74 and 60.86+/-1.65. In group A, the values for BMI at baseline, 12 w and 24 w were 26.45+/-.41, 25.78+/-.42 and 25.31+/-.40 while in group B the values were 26.09+/-.76, 25.53+/-.71 and 24.96+/-.68 respectively. In group A, WHR values were 0.79+/-.007, 0.78+/-.007 and 0.78+/-.007 while in group B 0.79+/-.010, 0.79+/-0.108, 0.79+/-.011 at baseline, 12 w and 24 w respectively. However, on comparing both the groups at 12 and 24 w, no statistically significant difference was observed in all the parameters. Conclusion(s): There was a definite improvement in anthropometric parameters with both metformin and myoinositol but on comparing these drugs, no significant difference was observed. Thus, myoinositol can also be used as an alternative to metformin for the treatment of PCOS.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

N2  - The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of metformin on metabolic and endocrine parameters in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The study included 40 patients with PCOS. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether they will receive metformin (500 mg 3 times a day, n=20) or placebo (n=20) for 3 consecutive months. Serum concentrations of fasting blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, INSL-3, visfatin, FSH, and LH were measured at baseline and after 3 months of therapy. The key endocrine and metabolic parameters significantly changed after metformin treatment. The systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced in the metformin group after treatment compared to placebo (p<0.001). A significant reduction in the size of the right ovary was observed after metformin treatment (p=0.05), while no change was found in the size of left ovary (p>0.12). Moreover, a significant reduction was observed in the serum levels of FSH (p>0.01), LH (p>0.001), and visfatin (p>0.001) after metformin treatment. However, HOMA-IR (which is used to assess insulin resistance) failed to reach the statistical significance (p=0.20). We conclude that metformin treatment in females with PCOS showed significant improvement in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. In addition, an improvement in the hormonal profile in the form of reduction in LH, FSH, and visfatin levels was observed. Thus, therapeutic intervention with metformin could be of clinical importance in high-risk group of young females with PCOS.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KGStuttgart . New York.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in later life. We aimed to study the effect of liraglutide intervention on markers of VTE and CVD risk, in PCOS. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, 72 overweight and/or insulinresistant women with PCOS were randomized, in a 2:1 ratio, to liraglutide or placebo 1.8 mg/day. Endpoints included between-group difference in change (baseline to follow-up) in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels and in thrombin generation test parameters: endogenous thrombin potential, peak thrombin concentration, lag time and time to peak. Mean weight loss was 5.2 kg (95% CI 3.0-7.5 kg, P < 0.001) in the liraglutide group compared with placebo. We detected no effect on endogenous thrombin potential in either group. In the liraglutide group, peak thrombin concentration decreased by 16.71 nmol/L (95% CI 2.32-31.11, P < 0.05) and lag time and time to peak increased by 0.13 min (95% CI 0.01-0.25, P < 0.05) and 0.38 min (95% CI 0.09-0.68, P < 0.05), respectively, but there were no between-group differences. There was a trend toward 12% (95% CI 0-23, P = 0.05) decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the liraglutide group, and there was a trend toward 16% (95% CI-4 to 32, P = 0.10) reduction, compared with placebo. In overweight women with PCOS, liraglutide intervention caused an approximate 5% weight loss. In addition, liraglutide affected thrombin generation, although not significantly differently from placebo. A concomitant trend toward improved fibrinolysis indicates a possible reduction of the baseline thrombogenic potential. The findings point toward beneficial effects of liraglutide on markers of VTE and CVD risk, which should be further pursued in larger studies.Copyright © 2017 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.

N2  - Background: Liraglutide 3mg was recently approved as an anti-obesity drug. Metformin is weight neutral, yet it could enhance the therapeutic index of GLP-1 agonist. We compared weight-lowering potential of liraglutide 1.2mg in combination with metformin to liraglutide 3mg monotherapy in obese PCOS. Method(s): Thirty obese women with PCOS (aged 33.1+/-6.1years, BMI 38.3+/-5.4kg/m2) were randomized to combination (COMBO) of metformin (MET) 1000mg BID and liraglutide 1.2mg QD (N=15) or liraglutide 3mg (LIRA3) QD alone (N=15) for 12weeks. The primary outcome was change in anthropometric measures of obesity. Result(s): Both treatments led to significant weight loss (3.6+/-2.5kg, p=0.002 in COMBO vs 6.3+/-3.7kg, p=0.001 in LIRA3). BMI and waist circumference reduction in LIRA3 was greater than in COMBO (2.2+/-1.3 vs 1.3+/-0.9kg/m2 , p=0.05 and 4.2+/-3.4 vs 2.2+/-6.2cm, p=0.014, respectively). Both interventions resulted in a significant decrease of post-OGTT glucose levels. COMBO significantly reduced total testosterone and was associated with less nausea. Conclusion(s): Short-term interventions with COMBO and LIRA3 both led to significant improvement of measures of obesity in obese PCOS, LIRA3 being superior to COMBO. However, COMBO further improved androgen profile beyond weight reduction and was associated with better tolerability. Trial registration: The study was retrospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02909933) on 16th of September 2016.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia may play a role in pathogenesis of PCOS. One of the common therapeutic methods is using insulin-sensitizing drugs such as metformin and thiazolidinediones. Objective(s): The purpose was to determine the effect of metformin and pioglitazone on clinical, hormonal and metabolic parameters in women with PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty four women randomly received one of the following for 3 months: metformin (n=28) (500 mg three times a day), pioglitazone (30 mg daily) (n=28) and combination of both metformin and pioglitazone (n=28) (30 mg/day pioglitazone plus 500 mg metformin three times a day). Hormonal profile, fasting serum insulin, body weight, body mass index, menstrual status and waist to hip ratio were evaluated before and after treatment. Result(s): Metformin and pioglitazone and combination therapy induced favorable changes in fasting serum insulin, HOMA-IR index, QUICKI, fasting glucose to insulin ratio in women with PCOS. Body weight, BMI, and waist to hip ratio increased significantly after treatment with pioglitazone but the data were similar after administration of metformin or combination therapy. Total testosterone level decreased significantly only after treatment with metformin. After 3 months in patients who received pioglitazone or combination therapy, menstrual cycles became regular in 71.4% and 73.9% respectively. While menstrual improvement happened only in 36.4% of the patients treated with metformin. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that insulin-sensitizing drugs induce beneficial effect in insulin resistance and menstrual cyclicity but only metformin ameliorated hyperandrogenemia in women with PCOS. Treatment with combination of metformin and pioglitazone did not show more benefit than monotherapy with each drug alone.Copyright © 2016, Research and Clinical Center for Infertitlity.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and increased prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders. The impact of PCOS-specific treatments on these co-morbidities is unclear. Objective(s): To assess the impact of weight loss and decreasing hyperandrogenism on HRQOL and mood and anxiety disorders in women with PCOS. Design/Setting/Participants: A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (OWL-PCOS) of preconception treatment conducted at two academic centers in women (age, 18-40 years; body mass index, 27-42 kg/m2) with PCOS defined by Rotterdam criteria. Intervention(s): Continuous oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or intensive lifestyle intervention or the combination (Combined) for 16 weeks. Main Outcome Measure(s): Changes in HRQOL assessed by PCOSQ and SF-36 and prevalence of depression and anxiety disorder assessed by PRIME-MD PHQ. Result(s): The lowest scores were noted on the general health domain of the SF-36 and the weight and infertility domains on the PCOSQ. All three interventions resulted in significant improvement in the general health score on the SF-36. Both the OCP and Combined groups showed improvements in all domains of the PCOSQ (P<.01) compared to baseline scores. The Combined group had significant improvements in the weight, body hair, and infertility domains compared to a single treatment group (P < .05). In a linear regression model, change in weight correlated with improvements in the weight domain (P < .001) and physical well-being (P < .02), change in T correlated with improvements in the hair domain (P < .001), and change in both weight and T correlated with the infertility (P < .001) and menstrual domains (P < .05). Conclusion(s): Both weight loss and OCP use result in significant improvements in several physical and mental domains related to quality of life, depressive symptoms, and anxiety disorders, and combined therapies offer further benefits in overweight/obese women with PCOS.

N2  - Background: While combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are commonly used to treat polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), comparative data regarding metabolic effects of different progestogens on this patient population are missing. This study aimed to compare the different effects of drospirenone (DRP)-containing COCs with cyproterone acetate (CPA)-containing COCs, combined with metformin and lifestyle modifications in women with PCOS and metabolic disorders. Method(s): Ninety-nine women with PCOS and a metabolic disorder between January 2011 and January 2013 were enrolled into this prospective randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomized into two groups such as DRP-containing COCs, and CPA-containing COCs. Participants took COCs cyclically for 6 months, combined with metformin administration (1.5 g/d) and lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise). Clinical measures and biochemical and hormone profiles were compared. Comparisons for continuous variables were evaluated with paired and unpaired Student's t-tests. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used when the data were not normally distributed. Analysis of covariance was used to control for age, body mass index (BMI), and baseline data of each analyzed parameter when compared between the two groups. Result(s): A total of 68 patients have completed the study. The combination regimen of COCs, metformin, and lifestyle modifications in these patients resulted in a significant decrease in BMI, acne, and hirsutism scores when compared to baseline levels in both groups (P < 0.05). Blood pressure (BP) was significantly different in the CPA group when compared to baseline (75.14 +/- 6.77 mmHg vs. 80.70 +/- 5.60 mmHg, P < 0.01), and after 6 months of treatment, only the change in systolic BP was significantly different between the two groups (4.00 [-6.00, 13.00] mmHg vs. -3.50 [-13.00, 9.00] mmHg, P = 0.009). Fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance decreased significantly in the DRP group (5.40 +/- 0.41 mmol/L vs. 5.21 +/- 0.32 mmol/L, P = 0.041; 13.90 [10.50, 18.40] muU/ml vs. 10.75 [8.60, 13.50] muU/ml, P = 0.020; 3.74 [2.85, 4.23] vs. 2.55 [1.92, 3.40], P = 0.008) but did not differ between the two groups. While individual lipid profiles increased in both groups, no statistically significant difference was observed. Conclusion(s): DRP-containing COCs combined with metformin and lifestyle modifications could better control BP and correct carbohydrate metabolism in women with PCOS and metabolic disorders compared with CPA-containing COCs.Copyright © 2016 Chinese Medical Journal.

N2  - Objective To compare the effects of 30 mug and 20 mug ethinyl estradiol (EE) among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods In a randomized study, patients with PCOS, a history of six or fewer menstrual cycles in the previous 12 months, and abnormal body hair growth were enrolled at a center in Kolkata, India, between May 1, 2012, and January 31, 2014. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomization table to receive an oral contraceptive pill containing 3 mg drospirenone and either 30 mug EE or 20 mug EE. Patients were followed up after 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome was the absolute change in the free androgen index. Participants were masked to group assignment but investigators were not. Analyses were by intention to treat. Results Overall, 112 patients were enrolled. At 6 months, the free androgen index had decreased by 4.96 +/- 6.01 among patients receiving 30 mug (n = 55) and by 4.81 +/- 6.03 among those receiving 20 mug (n = 57; P = 0.89). At 12 months, the decrease from baseline was 5.23 +/- 5.79 with 30 mug and 4.99 +/- 5.86 with 20 mug (P = 0.82). Conclusion Among patients with PCOS, an oral contraceptive pill containing 20 mug EE has similar effects on androgen levels to those of a pill containing 30 mug.

N2  - In this study, we assessed the efficacy and safe usage of the oral contraceptive, Diane-35, in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) when combined with the drug metformin. Eighty-two patients with PCOS were randomly divided into two equal groups: Diane-35 treatment group and Diane-35 plus metformin group. Three treatment cycles were administered. Patients biomedical data such as height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, body fat percentage, acne score, hirsutism score and serum hormone levels were selected, which were tested between the second and the fifth day of the menstrual cycle and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T), blood glucose, blood lipids and insulin levels(IR) were analyzed. Significant reduction in body mass index (BMI), acne score, LH and T levels were observed in both groups after three months of treatment; on the other hand, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) concentration elevated (p < 0.05). Combined treatment group had a significant change in BMI index and fasting blood glucose levels compared to Diane-35 alone treatment group (p < 0.05). With personalized nutrition and exercise program, Diane-35 only group or Diane-35 plus metformin group had both significantly lowered their serum testosterone levels and had improved acne symptoms. Diane-35 plus metformin combination had shown reduced fat percentage levels in patients with PCOS, and had shown improved glucose and lipid metabolism.Copyright © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - The aim of this study was to explore the inter-relationship between polycystic ovary syndrome and gestational diabetes mellitus, and demonstrate maternal and fetal outcomes. This was a case-control study in 1360 pregnant women who received a diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus between 24 and 28 weeks of gestational age. Among all diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus, 150 pregnant women had received a polycystic ovary syndrome, and 160 women who did not have polycystic ovary syndrome were designated as controls. The incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension was 26.3% and 12% in the case and control groups, respectively. Preeclampsia was seen at an incidence of 12% and 6% in case and in control groups, respectively. The difference in neonatal hypoglycemia between the two groups was statistically significant, with an incidence of 17% and 5% in the case and in control groups, respectively. This study demonstrated that the presence of polycystic ovary syndrome along with gestational diabetes mellitus increases the risk of pregnancy induced hypertension by 2.4 fold, preeclampsia by 2 fold and neonatal hypoglycemia by 3.2 fold, compared to gestational diabetes mellitus alone.Copyright © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Objective. To examine the association of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in early pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and adverse birth outcomes. Methods. In this retrospective cohort study including 2389 pregnant women, the medical records of 352 women diagnosed with PCOS were evaluated. Outcomes included GDM, preterm birth, low birth weight, macrosomia, and being small and large for gestational age. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association of the risk for GDM and adverse birth outcomes with PCOS after adjusting for confounders. Results. Women previously diagnosed with PCOS had a higher risk of GDM (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-2.09). A strong association was seen between PCOS and preterm birth (adjusted OR 1.69, 95% CI: 1.08-2.67). On stratified analysis, the adjusted OR for GDM among women with PCOS undergoing assisted reproductive technology was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.03-1.92) and among women with PCOS who conceived spontaneously was 1.60 (1.18-2.15). No increased risk for other adverse birth outcomes was observed. Conclusions. Women with PCOS were more likely to experience GDM and preterm birth.Copyright © 2016 Qing Xiao et al.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the common endocrine disorders in women of reproductive ages. It is associated with a range of disorders, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance (IR), compensatory hyperinsulinemia, gestational, and type 2 diabetes, and increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity. There are different treatments available for PCOS. The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the effects of metformin, flutamide plus oral contraceptives (OCs), and simvastatin on the metabolic consequences of PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was a single-blind clinical trial. The subjects were selected from a group of patient with PCOS and metabolic syndrome, who were referred to the midwifery clinic of Al-Zahra Hospital and Beheshti Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. A total of 111 subjects were randomly assigned to three groups: metformin, flutamide plus OCs, and simvastatin groups. The measurements were performed at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. Paired t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and chi-square test were applied in this study. Result(s): A total of 102 subjects were analyzed in this study, 34 subjects were allotted in each group. The prevalence of IR was statistically different between three groups (P-value = 0.001). After a 6-month course, metformin showed larger reduction in fasting blood sugar (FBS) level (P-value < 0.001). However, except for metformin, two other treatments reduced C-reactive protein (CRP) level significantly (both P-values < 0.001). The level of triglycerides (TGs) decreased considerably in all groups (all P-values < 0.001). Both metformin and simvastatin decreased BMI significantly (both P-values < 0.001). None of the treatments changed high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level (all P-values > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Metformin performed better in FBS reduction. Simvastatin had better performance in terms of reducing TG level and waist circumference.Copyright © 2016 Journal of Research in Medical Sciences.

T1  - Effect of myo-inositol and melatonin versus myo-inositol, in a randomized controlled trial, for improving in vitro fertilization of patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) induces anovulation in women of reproductive age, and is one of the pathological factors involved in the failure of in vitro fertilization (IVF). Indeed, PCOS women are characterized by poor quality oocytes. Therefore, a treatment for enhancing oocyte quality becomes crucial for these patients. Myo-Inositol and melatonin proved to be efficient predictors for positive IVF outcomes, correlating with high oocyte quality. We tested the synergistic effect of myo-inositol and melatonin in IVF protocols with PCOS patients in a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial. Five-hundred twenty-six PCOS women were divided into three groups: Controls (only folic acid: 400 mcg), Group A (Inofolic plus, a daily dose of myo-inositol: 4000 mg, folic acid: 400 mcg, and melatonin: 3 mg), and Group B (Inofolic, a daily dose of myo-inositol: 4000 mg, and folic acid: 400 mcg). The main outcome measures were oocyte and embryo quality, clinical pregnancy and implantation rates. The treatment lasted from the first day of the cycle until 14 days after embryo transfer. Myo-inositol and melatonin have shown to enhance, synergistically, oocyte and embryo quality. In consideration of the beneficial effect observed in our trial and on the bases of previous studies, we decided to integrate routinely MI and M supplementation in the IVF protocols. The same treatment should be taken carefully in consideration in all procedures of this kind.Copyright © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Objective To determine whether the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) independently predicts increased rates of pregnancy complications relative to control subjects, after adjusting for important confounders. Design Retrospective cohort. Setting Not applicable. Patient(s) A review of all pregnancies after fresh IVF with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection transfers from December 2006 to 2012 (n = 1,084) identified 394 eligible singleton births (71 women with PCOS; 323 controls without). Intervention(s) Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure(s) Singleton births were assessed for selected adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Result(s) Women with PCOS demonstrated a higher risk of developing the following pregnancy complications after adjusting for differences in age, parity, body mass index, and time to conception: gestational diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-7.33), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (AOR 4.25, 95% CI 1.94-9.32), preterm birth <37 weeks (AOR 2.30, 95% CI 1.07-4.97), and large for gestational age >90th percentile (AOR 2.77, 95% CI 1.21-6.35). The increased risk of preterm birth <37 weeks was eliminated after adjusting for development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, whereas the increased risk of large for gestational age remained significant after adjusting for gestational diabetes mellitus status. Time to conception did not differ significantly between groups, nor did rates of antepartum hemorrhage, cesarean section, or perinatal mortality. Conclusion(s) Polycystic ovary syndrome independently predicts higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes after adjusting for differences in maternal age, parity, body mass index, and time to conception. This new information may be of relevance in counseling and monitoring women with PCOS, although larger prospective studies may be needed to validate our findings.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Aim This study was done to illustrate the clinical and biochemical effects of ethinyl estradiol-cyproterone acetate (EE-AC) and metformin in this disease. Methods This was a randomized control trial study, done on twenty-six female patients already diagnosed as cases of PCOS. Participants were divided into two study groups: group one (Group 1), received metformin of 500 mg twice daily and the second group (Group 2), was given ethinyl estradiol-cyproterone acetate for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days drug-free. The course of the treatment for both groups was continued for three consecutive months. Results Group 1 showed a statistical significant increase in serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (P = 0.006) and a decrease in the level of triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.006). In addition, Group 1 had a significant reduction in the levels of very density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) (P = 0.006). Group 2 had a significant increase in serum TG levels (P = 0.01), associated with a significant decrease in serum LDL-C (P = 0.04). Serum testosterone was significantly reduced in group 1 (P = 0.038). This was associated with an improvement in glucose tolerance test (GTT) and BMI in the same group (group 1). Group 2, had an improvement in the menstrual cycle control; hirsutism and acne. Conclusion This study showed that metformin treatment is beneficial in improving serum lipids; glucose homeostasis and BMI, however, the ethinyl estradiol-cyproterone acetate is superior in improving the clinical manifestation of patients with PCOS, including menstrual cycle regulation, hyperandrogenic state.Copyright © 2015 Diabetes India

N2  - Objective: This study aims to evaluate the change in serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in patients with morbid obesity undergoing bariatric surgery for weight loss. Material(s) and Method(s): In this prospective observational study, 75 patients of reproductive age (20-35 years) undergoing bariatric surgery for morbid obesity were followed up after six months to determine the changes in weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), menstrual pattern and serum AMH. The results were further studied on basis of pre operative classification of patients in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and non-PCOS group. Result(s): The serum AMH levels were statistically higher in patients of PCOS group pre operatively and at the end of six months in comparison to non-PCOS patients. The AMH values reduced post operatively in both groups significantly so much in the values though not significant statistically. Non-PCOS patients had lower AMH values pre operatively and showed a trend towards reducing ovarian reserve after six months. The overall change in AMH values in both groups was statistically significant as was the normalization of menstrual irregularity. Conclusion(s): Morbidly obese patients with PCOS appear to benefit from bariatric surgery both in terms of regularization of menstrual function and normalization of serum AMH values.Copyright © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - A prospective cohort study was conducted to determine whether chromosome aneuploidy increases the risk of early spontaneous abortions in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A total of 1461 patients who conceived after IVF and embryo transfer were followed; 100 patients who had experienced clinical spontaneous abortion were recruited, 32 with PCOS and 68 without PCOS. Before 2013, genetic analysis comprised conventional cultured villus chromosome karyotyping and a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification subtelomere assay combined with fluorescence in-situ hybridization; since 2013, array-based comparative genomic hybridization technique combined with chromosome karyotyping has been used. Age, BMI, pregnancy history, gestational age and total gonadotrophin dosage did not differ significantly between the PCOS and non-PCOS groups. In the PCOS group, 28.1% of abortuses demonstrated aneuploidy, which was significantly lower (P = 0.001) than in the non-PCOS group (72.1%). Further statistical analyses controlling for maternal age demonstrated that abortuses of women with PCOS were significantly less (P = 0.001) likely to have chromosome aneuploidy. Embryonic aneuploidy does not play a vital role in early spontaneous abortion in women with PCOS. Maternal factors resulting in endometrial disorders are more likely to be responsible for the increased risk of early spontaneous abortion in patients with PCOS.Copyright © 2016 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

N2  - Introduction. We evaluated the effects of a therapy that combines myo-inositol (MI) and D-chiro-inositol (DCI) in young overweight women affected by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), characterized by oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism, correlated to insulin resistance. Methods. We enrolled 46 patients affected by PCOS and, randomly, we assigned them to two groups, A and B, treated, respectively, with the association of MI plus DCI, in a 40: 1 ratio, or with placebo (folic acid) for six months. Thus, we analyzed pretreatment and posttreatment FSH, LH, 17-beta-Estradiol, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin, androstenedione, free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, HOMA index, and fasting glucose and insulin. Results. We recorded a statistically significant reduction of LH, free testosterone, fasting insulin, and HOMA index only in the group treated with the combined therapy of MI plus DCI; in the same patients, we observed a statistically significant increase of 17-beta-Estradiol levels. Conclusions. The combined therapy of MI plus DCI is effective in improving endocrine and metabolic parameters in young obese PCOS affected women.Copyright © 2016 Elena Benelli et al.

N2  - study question: Are macroscopic and microscopic placental characteristics in a heterogeneous group of women diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) different from those of a low-risk general population? summaryanswer:Women with PCOS have significantly different microscopic placental characteristics compared with control women, independently from pregnancy complications. what is known already: Non-obesewomen withPCOSwhoconceived spontaneously have a significantly reduced placental volume and weight, with more chronic villitis and intervillositis compared with healthy controls. study design, size, duration: A subset of a large prospective cohort study of pregnant women with PCOS was used. Healthy (low-risk) women who delivered at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy were used as the reference population. The placentas of 73 women with PCOS were analysed and compared with 209 placentas of healthy women. participants/materials, setting, methods: Placentas were collected after delivery from women with PCOS who were followed fromprior to conception until delivery. The placentaswere macroscopically and microscopically analysed and compared with placentas of healthy women with either a spontaneous start of labour who delivered at term or who had an elective Caesarean section. main results and the role of chance: After adjusting for potential confounders, placentas from women with PCOS showed more chorioamnionitis (P , 0.001), funisitis (P 0.019), villitis (P 0.045), thrombosis (P 0.018), infarction (P 0.010), villous immaturity (P 0.009) and nucleated fetal red blood cells (P , 0.001). In a subgroup analysis, among women with and without pregnancy complications within the PCOS group, only the occurrence of thrombosis was increased in pregnancies complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension or pre-eclampsia (30%, versus 0% in gestational diabetes pregnancies and 13% in uncomplicated pregnancies; P 0.008). limitations, reasons for caution: There might be a small proportion of women with PCOS in the reference group, since this groupwasnot screened forPCOS. As a result, the observed differencemaybe an underestimation of the true difference. Placentas were stored for up to 72 h at 48C, this is common practice but some degenerative changes cannot be ruled out absolutely. Also, there is possibility that baseline differences between the groups may in part explain some of the differences in placental pathology. wider implications of the findings: Ourfindings suggest that, in general,womenwithPCOScan have placental alterations associated with an increased hypoxic state, which seems not to be caused by the increased incidence of pregnancy complications.Copyright © The Author 2015.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION Does the prevalence of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes vary in women diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) according to different definitions? SUMMARY ANSWER A comparison of different criteria revealed that there is a substantial risk for perinatal complications in PCOS women, regardless of the used definition. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Pregnant women with PCOS are susceptible to perinatal complications. At present, there are three main definitions for PCOS. So far, we are aware of only one study, which found that the elevated risk for complications varied widely depending on the different phenotypes and features but only considered a relatively small sample size for some of the phenotypes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Retrospective matched cohort study. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Data of primiparous women with PCOS according to ESHRE/ASRM 2003 criteria and healthy controls giving birth to neonates 500 g were included. A total of 885 women were analysed: out of 177 women with PCOS, 85 (48.0%) met the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 1990 criteria, another 14 (7.9%) featured the additional phenotypes defined by The Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AE-PCOS) 2006 criteria, 78 (44.1%) were classified as PCOS exclusively by the ESHRE/ASRM 2003 definition, and 708 represented the control group. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The prevalence of adverse maternal (49.4 versus 64.3 versus 60.3%, P = 0.313) and neonatal (27.1 versus 35.7 versus 23.1%, P = 0.615) outcomes did not differ within the three PCOS groups (ESHRE/ASRM, NIH, AE-PCOS, respectively). Compared with healthy controls, the risk for maternal complications was increased in PCOS patients [odds ratio (OR) 2.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82-3.64; P < 0.001] while there was no difference in neonatal complications (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.56-1.21; P = 0.343). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION A limitation of our study is its retrospective design and the relatively small sample size, particularly in the AE-PCOS subgroup. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Since women with PCOS have, regardless of the used definition, a high risk of maternal and neonatal complications they should be informed and advised to follow regular checks in units where problems can be detected early to allow specialized care.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder characterized by insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. The interaction of these factors might result in increased risks of miscarriage and pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). To examine the pregnancy risks in women with PCOS, we compared obstetrical outcomes between patients with and without PCOS. We also studied the differences in maternal characteristics, glucose intolerance and pregnancy complications between PCOS patients with and without GDM, with and without obesity, and between successful pregnancies and miscarriages. We observed a high incidence of GDM and prevalence of GDM diagnosis in the first trimester in PCOS. Patients with GDM had higher body mass index (BMI) and lower homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) at preconception than those without GDM. Obese pregnant women with PCOS demonstrated a high incidence of GDM with severe insulin resistance, including high fasting insulin, HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and HOMA-beta at preconception compared with normal-weight patients. BMI was significantly correlated with HOMA-IR or HOMA-beta, and both indices were lower in PCOS patients with than without GDM for the same BMI. There were no significant differences in maternal characteristics (excluding maternal age) between PCOS patients with successful pregnancy and PCOS patients with miscarriages. Our data suggest that pregnant women with PCOS have an increased risk of GDM, especially if they have obesity and/or poorer insulin secretion. Measure of beta-cell function, such as HOMA-beta, at preconception might be a useful predictor of the risk of GDM in pregnant PCOS patients.Copyright © The Japan Endocrine Society.

N2  - Objective: This retrospective cohort study evaluated the obstetric outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and isolated polycystic ovaries (PCO) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Method(s): We studied 104 women with PCOS, 184 with PCO and 576 age-matched controls undergoing the first IVF treatment cycle between 2002 and 2009. Obstetric outcomes and complications including gestational diabetes (GDM), gestational hypertension (GHT), gestational proteinuric hypertension (PET), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), gestation at delivery, baby's Apgar scores and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were reviewed. Result(s): Among the 864 patients undergoing IVF treatment, there were 253 live births in total (25 live births in the PCOS group, 54 in the PCO group and 174 in the control group). The prevalence of obstetric complications (GDM, GHT, PET and IUGR) and the obstetric outcomes (gestation at delivery, birth weight, Apgar scores and NICU admissions) were comparable among the three groups. Adjustments for age and multiple pregnancies were made using multiple logistic regression and we found no statistically significant difference among the three groups. Conclusion(s): Patients with PCO+/-PCOS do not have more adverse obstetric outcomes when compared with non-PCO patients undergoing IVF treatment.Copyright © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Context: Lifestyle modification is recommended in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) prior to conception but there are few randomized trials to support its implementation or benefit. Objective(s): This study aimed to determine the relative efficacy of preconception intervention on reproductive and metabolic abnormalities in overweight/obese women with PCOS. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This was a randomized controlled trial of preconception and infertility treatment at Academic Health Centers in women with infertility due to PCOS, age 18-40 y and body mass index 27-42 kg/m2. Intervention(s): Women were randomly assigned to receive either 16 weeks of 1) continuous oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (ethinyl estradiol 20 mcg/1mgnorethindrone acetate) ("OCP"); 2) lifestyle modification consisting of caloric restriction with meal replacements, weight loss medication (either sibutramine, or orlistat),andincreasedphysicalactivitytopromotea7%weightloss ("Lifestyle");or3)combinedtreatment with bothOCPandlifestyle modification ("Combined"). After preconception intervention,womenunderwent standardized ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate and timed intercourse for four cycles. Pregnancies were followed with trimester visits until delivery. Main Outcome Measure(s): Weight, ovulation, and live birth were measured. Result(s): Weconsented 216 and randomly assigned 149women(Lifestyle: n=50; OCP: n=49; Combined: n-50).WeachievedsignificantweightlosswithbothLifestyle(meanweightloss,-6.2%;95%confidence interval (CI),-7.4-5.0; and Combined (mean weight loss-6.4%; 95% CI,-7.6-5.2) compared with baselineandOCP(bothP<.001). Therewasasignificant increase in the prevalence of metabolicsyndrome at the end of preconception treatment compared with baseline within OCP (odds ratio [OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.42-4.27) whereas no change in metabolic syndrome was detected in the Lifestyle (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.63-2.19) or Combined (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.44-1.17) groups. Cumulative ovulation rates were superior after weight loss: OCP, 46%; Lifestyle, 60%; and Combined,67%(P<.05). Live birth rates were OCP, 12%; Lifestyle, 26%; and Combined, 24% (P=.13). Conclusion(s): A preconception weight loss intervention eliminates the adverse metabolic oral contraceptive effects and, compared with oral contraceptive pretreatment, leads to higher ovulation rates.Copyright © 2015 by the Endocrine Society.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by irregular menses, elevated androgens, and insulin resistance. Little information is published about the treatment of adolescent PCOS. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to evaluate metformin versus oral contraceptive pills (OCP) in treating adolescent PCOS. Twenty-two girls were randomized to either treatment for 6 months. The outcomes variables included body mass index (BMI) and free testosterone (FT). Result(s): BMI decreased in all patients (metformin p=0.004, OCP p=0.045). FT decreased significantly only with OCP. Insulin resistance measures decreased in all patients but did not reach significance. The only significant difference in any of the variables between the two groups was number of menses. BMI and FT remained less than baseline for 3 months off treatment. Conclusion(s): Metformin and OCP have a positive effect on BMI, which persists after treatment is discontinued. FT decreased with both treatments, but only reached significance with OCP.Copyright © 2015 by De Gruyter.

N2  - Objective: A randomized trial to compare the effects of two oral contraceptive pills containing either chlormadinone acetate or drospirenone as the progestogen, in women with PCOS for a period of two-year follow-up. Method(s): Group A received ethinyl-estradiol 0.03 mg + drospirenone 3 mg (EE + DRSP; n = 56) and Group B received ethinyl-estradiol 0.03 mg + chlormadinone acetate 2 mg (EE + CMA; n = 50). Clinical, hormonal and biochemical parameters were compared at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. Result(s): The increase in total cholesterol and hsCRP levels was statistically significantly higher at 6, 12 and 24 months in Group B when compared with Group A. The change in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level at the 24 months of treatment was statistically significantly higher in Group A. Group A has a significantly higher reduction in FAI at 6 and 24 months, in FGS at 6, 12 and 24 months and in HOMA-IR index at 12 and 24 months when compared with Group B. Conclusion(s): Drospirenone containing combined oral contraceptive (COC) is found to have more favorable effects on lipid profiles, hsCRP levels, insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism when compared with the CMA containing COC and appears to be more beneficial for the long-term cardiovascular and metabolic aspects of PCOS.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Objective: Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) are widely used for treating women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Metformin has beneficial effects on insulin resistance and endothelial functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of treatment with drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol (EE) alone or in combination with metformin on the flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) in women with PCOS. Method(s): Fifty women with PCOS (mean age 23 +/- 5) were randomized to oral treatment of OCP alone (n = 25) or an OCP combination with metformin (n = 25) for 6 months. FMD from the brachial artery and CIMT were calculated. The hormonal profile, HOMA-IR score, basal insulin and glucose levels were studied in both groups. Before and after 6 months' treatment, echocardiographic measurements and laboratory tests were also obtained. Result(s): After 6 months' treatment we observed a small decrease in FMD in the OCP group (14.9 +/- 9.4 versus 14.4 +/- 9.9, p = 0.801) and a slight increase in the combination group (14.5 +/- 9.1 versus 15.0 +/- 8.0, p = 0.715) but neither of them reached significance. CIMT increased in the OCP group (0.048 +/- 0.011 to 0.050 +/- 0.010 cm, p = 0.433) and decreased slightly in the combination group (0.049 +/- 0.012, 0.048 +/- 0.011 cm, p = 0.833). Conclusion(s): We demonstrated that adding metformin to OCP treatment may have beneficial effect on FMD and CIMT that represent vascular function in patients with PCOS. These results suggest that adding metformin to OCP treatment for PCOS could preserve the cardiovascular system and improve it.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Abstract Aim To compare the effects of ethinyl estradiol (EE) 30 mcg/desogestrel 150 mcg plus spironolactone 25 mg/day (group A) versus EE 35 mcg/cyproterone acetate 2 mg (group B) on hyperandrogenism and metabolism in PCOS. Methods This was a randomized clinical study. Eighteen women in groups A and B received medications for three cycles. Acne score, androgens and metabolic parameters were assessed before and after treatment. Results One and two women in groups A and B, respectively, were excluded from the study. Both groups had significantly decreased acne score and free androgen index, and increased sex hormone-binding globulin levels. Cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein were significantly increased in group B, and androstenedione was significantly decreased in group A. The regular withdrawal bleeding was obtained in both groups. Conclusion Both regimens had quite similar efficacy on hyperandrogenism after three cycles of therapy and without any changes in metabolic parameters.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Objectives To investigate obstetric outcomes in Danish women with different phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and isolated hyperandrogenism (HA) and describe the risk of adverse obstetric outcomes in women with PCOS and HA compared to controls. Design Cohort study. Setting Odense University Hospital, Denmark. Population Women with PCOS were identified prospectively starting in 1997. Singleton pregnancies in women with PCOS and HA during 2003-2011 were included (n = 199). A control group was matched to the patient cohort according to date of childbirth (n = 995). Methods Data on clinical characteristics and obstetric outcomes were collected in patients with PCOS and HA and controls. In PCOS and HA, total and free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, and hemoglobin A1c were measured outside pregnancy. During pregnancy, oral glucose tolerance tests were performed in 39 patients and 123 controls according to Danish national guidelines. PCOS phenotypes were based on the Rotterdam criteria. Main outcome measures Gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, delivery by emergency cesarean section, preterm delivery and anthropometric measures in the newborn. Results The incidence of adverse obstetric outcomes and anthropometric measures among the newborns were comparable between different phenotypes of PCOS and patients with HA. In the oral glucose tolerance test, patients had a higher risk of gestational diabetes mellitus compared with controls; the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) was 3.3 (1.5-6.9) after adjustment for age, parity, and body mass index (p = 0.002). The incidence of other adverse obstetric outcomes was similar in patients and controls. Conclusions Obstetric outcomes were comparable in women with different PCOS phenotypes.Copyright © 2014 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

N2  - Abstract Objective: To compare metformin and combined oral contraceptive pill (COC) effects over 24 months in adolescent PCOS. Design(s): Randomized controlled study. Setting(s): Alexandria ICSI centre. Patient(s): 117 adolescent girls with PCOS, were randomized to: group A (n = 40): metformin, group B (n = 40): COC, and group C (n = 39): control. Intervention(s): Group A: received metformin, group B: received combined oral contraceptives. Main Outcome Measure(s): Improvement in cycle rhythm and hirsutism. Result(s): In group B a significant decline in serum testosterone reached the lowest value by the end of the second year (0.7 +/- 0.2 versus 1.3 +/- 0.5 mug/ml). By the end of the study, group A showed a significant decline in fasting (18.6 +/- 3.0-10.0 +/- 3.0 muIU/ml) and after-load insulin levels (126 +/- 43-64 +/- 15 muIU/ml) with a significant rise in glucose/insulin ratio (GIR) from 4.1 +/- 0.3 to 4.6 +/- 0.5. Group B showed a significant rise in fasting and after-load insulin (from 15.0 +/- 3.0 muIU/ml and 103.0 +/- 91.0 muIU/ml to 19.0 +/- 4.0 and 187.0 +/- 22.0 muIU/ml, respectively) and GIR dropped significantly from 4.4 +/- 0.2 to 3.1 +/- 0.3. Metformin was associated with a significant loss of weight from 87.0 +/- 6.0 to 72.0 +/- 0.5 kg while COC was associated with a non-significant gain in weight (from 84.0 +/- 6.0 to 91.0 +/- 9.0 kg). Conclusion(s): Metformin and COC have comparable therapeutic effectiveness on cycle regularity and hirsutism. Metformin was associated with a significant improvement in metabolic syndrome, while COC was associated with a deterioration of metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Context: Lifestyle modification is recommended in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) prior to conception but there are few randomized trials to support its implementation or benefit. Objective(s): This study aimed to determine the relative efficacy of preconception intervention on reproductive and metabolic abnormalities in overweight/obese women with PCOS. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This was a randomized controlled trial of preconception and infertility treatment at Academic Health Centers in women with infertility due to PCOS, age 18-40 y and body mass index 27-42 kg/m2. Intervention(s): Women were randomly assigned to receive either 16 weeks of 1) continuous oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (ethinyl estradiol 20 mcg/1 mg norethindrone acetate) ("OCP"); 2) lifestyle modification consisting of caloric restriction with meal replacements, weight loss medication (either sibutramine, or orlistat), and increased physical activity to promote a 7% weight loss ("Lifestyle"); or 3) combined treatment with both OCP and lifestyle modification ("Combined"). After preconception intervention, women underwent standardized ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate and timed intercourse for four cycles. Pregnancies were followed with trimester visits until delivery. Main Outcome Measure(s): Weight, ovulation, and live birth were measured. Result(s): We consented 216 and randomly assigned 149 women (Lifestyle: n = 50; OCP: n = 49; Combined: n = 50). We achieved significant weight loss with both Lifestyle (mean weight loss, -6.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), -7.4--5.0; and Combined (mean weight loss, -6.4%; 95% CI, -7.6--5.2) compared with baseline and OCP (both P <.001). There was a significant increase in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome at the end of preconception treatment compared with baseline within OCP (odds ratio [OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.42-4.27) whereas no change in metabolic syndrome was detected in the Lifestyle (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.63-2.19) or Combined (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.44-1.17) groups. Cumulative ovulation rates were superior after weight loss: OCP, 46%; Lifestyle, 60%; and Combined, 67% (P <.05). Live birth rates were OCP, 12%; Lifestyle, 26%; and Combined, 24% (P =.13). Conclusion(s): A preconception weight loss intervention eliminates the adverse metabolic oral contraceptive effects and, compared with oral contraceptive pretreatment, leads to higher ovulation rates.Copyright © 2015 by the Endocrine Society.

N2  - Results: The incidence rates of GDM were 44.4%, 29.9% and 7.3% for PCOS ART, non-PCOS ART and non- PCOS spontaneous pregnant women, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used for determining risk factors of GDM in PCOS women with adjusted odds ratios for age, parity and hypothyroidism, the results revealed the most important and significant predictors for development of GDM in PCOS women as follow: menstrual irregularity (OR = 4.2; 95% CI = 1.7-10.6), serum triglycerides level >=150 mg/dL (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.07-3.6) and pregestational metformin use (OR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.2-0.7)., Study design: In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated medical records of 234 spontaneous pregnant women without PCOS in Akbarabadi Women's Hospital affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran, along with 234 pregnant women with PCOS and 234 pregnant non-PCOS women with ART conception who were treated at Royan institute, Tehran, Iran, at the same period of time, 2012 to February 2013. Exclusion criteria were as following: maternal age >=40, family history of diabetes in first-degree relatives, pre-pregnancy diabetes and history of gestational diabetes, history of stillbirth, recurrent miscarriage, birth weight baby >=4 kg (macrosomia), parity >4, Cushing's syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and overt hypothyroidism. The GDM diagnosis was according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. Incidence and the risk factors for GDM were evaluated., Conclusions: Pregnant Iranian women with a history of infertility and PCOS are at increased risk for developing GDM. It is recommendable to perform screening test for GDM in PCOS women with ART treatment, irregular menses and high serum triglycerides level in the early stage of pregnancy. Pregestational use of metformin can be effective in reducing the occurrence of GDM., Objectives: To compare the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in Iranian infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and women without PCOS after pregnancies resulting from either assisted reproductive technology (ART) or spontaneous as well as to determine the risk factors of GDM in PCOS women.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objective To investigate if patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who conceived via IVF treatment had a higher miscarriage rate than non-PCOS subjects after controlling for several important confounding variables relating to pregnancy loss. Study design A retrospective, observational, cohort study including a consecutive series of 564 embryo transfer cycles from PCOS patients and 7494 embryo transfer cycles from non-PCOS patients. Only the first pregnancy arising from IVF treatment was included for subsequent analysis. None of the subjects underwent ovarian diathermy or drilling prior to IVF treatment. Low dose (<=1000 mg daily), short term (<=3 weeks) metformin therapy was used in 50 of the 301 PCOS subjects included in the study. Results After controlling for the number of embryo transferred, the type of embryos transferred (fresh or frozen-thawed), and the stage of embryo development at the time of transfer, women with PCOS had a consistently higher biochemical pregnancy rate than women without PCOS (fresh single day 3 embryo transfer, 46.7% (7/15) vs. 14.5% (27/186), respectively, p < 0.05; frozen-thawed single day 3 embryo transfer, 25.9% (7/27) vs. 6.1% (11/181), p < 0.05; fresh double day 3 embryo transfer, 17.1% (12/70) vs. 7.6% (95/1256), p < 0.05; frozen-thawed double day 3 embryo transfer, 7.9% (15/189) vs. 3.4% (66/1968), p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the clinical miscarriage rate between the two groups of subjects. Conclusion PCOS patients who conceived following IVF treatment had higher biochemical loss than women without PCOS, but the clinical miscarriage rate was no different between the two groups. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: To compare the effects of combined oral contraceptives (OCs) containing cyproterone acetate and drospirenone in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): Fifty-two patients with PCOS were randomized in two groups: group A (n = 26) received 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol + 2 mg cyproterone acetate and group B (n = 26) received 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol + 3 mg drospirenone-containing OCs for 12 months. Baseline clinical features including body mass index, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) score were noted. Baseline biochemical parameters included androgen profile, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid profile, and oxidative stress. The percentages of changes for all parameters were compared. Result(s): The groups were comparable regarding the baseline characteristics. WHR decreased significantly from baseline (-4 % [-31 to 35]) in group B when compared to group A (0 % [-11 to 14]) (P = 0.033). The total mFG score decreased significantly from baseline (-35 % [-71 to 10]) in group A when compared to group B (-18 % [-72 to 30]) (P = 0.035). Changes in androgen hormone profile were comparable except DHEA-SO4 (-32 % [-53 to 15] in group B vs. -10 % [-49 to 63] in group A; P = 0.046). The effects of the drugs were similar regarding carbohydrate metabolism, lipid profile, and oxidative stress parameters. Conclusion(s): Cyproterone acetate containing OCs seem to be more effective to treat clinical hirsutism in patients with PCOS after 12 months of treatment. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Objective: Hyperandrogenic conditions in women are associated with increased rates of miscarriage. However, the specific role of maternal testosterone in early pregnancy and its association with pregnancy outcome is unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare serum testosterone levels during early pregnancy in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who either had successful pregnancies or miscarried. Method(s): We collected serum samples from women attending a university-based fertility centre at the time of their first positive serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test. The samples were subsequently assayed for total testosterone level. We used logistical regression modelling to control for PCOS diagnosis, BMI, and age. Result(s): Total testosterone levels were available for 346 pregnancies, including 286 successful pregnancies and 78 first trimester miscarriages. We found no difference in total testosterone levels between women who subsequently had an ongoing pregnancy (mean concentration 3.6 +/- 2.6 nmol/L) and women with a miscarriage (mean 3.6 +/- 2.4 nmol/L). Using the Rotterdam criteria to identify women with PCOS, we also found no differences in serum testosterone between women who had ongoing pregnancies or miscarriages, either with PCOS (P = 0.176) or without PCOS (P = 0.561). Conclusion(s): Our findings show that early pregnancy testosterone levels do not predict pregnancy outcome, and they call into question the role of testosterone in causing miscarriage in populations of women with PCOS. Further research is needed to elucidate the normal progression of testosterone levels during pregnancy and to investigate further the relationship between PCOS and miscarriage.Copyright © 2014 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

N2  - Context: Central obesity in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased inflammatory markers and increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Objective(s): To evaluate if improved body composition during treatment with metformin (M) vs. oral contraceptive pills (OCP) was associated with changes in circulating adiponectin, interleukin (IL)-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. Patients and interventions: Ninety patients with PCOS were randomized to 12-month treatment with M (2 g/day), M + OCP (150 mg desogestrel + 30 microgram ethinylestradiol) or OCP. Adiponectin, IL-6, MCP-1, whole body DXA scans, and clinical evaluations were performed before and after the intervention period in the 65 study completers. Main Outcome Measure(s): Changes in inflammatory markers and changes in total and regional fat mass estimates. Result(s): Adiponectin, IL-6, and MCP-1 levels were unchanged during the three types of medical intervention. Treatment with M and M + OCP was superior to OCP regarding decreased regional fat mass. Baseline adiponectin and IL-6 were associated with BMI, waist, and trunk fat mass. Changes in trunk fat were significantly associated with changes in IL-6 and MCP-1 during M + OCP. Conclusion(s): Long-term treatment with M alone or in combination with OCP was associated with improved body composition compared to OCP, whereas inflammatory markers were unchanged. OCP was not associated with increased inflammatory markers despite a small but significant weight gain. © 2014 Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).

N2  - Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of commonly used treatment regimens such as metformin (MET) or an oral contraceptive pill (OC) containing ethynyloestradiol and cyproterone acetate (EE-CPA) on surrogate serum CVD risk factors and markers of endothelial dysfunction (CRP, IL-6, sVCAM) in women with PCOS. Design(s): This study was conducted in a crossover design in order to compare the effects of 2 different treatment regimens in the same subject and has been registered under the number NCT01798875 in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. Method(s): 42 women with PCOS (age range 18-36 years, median BMI 24.9) were randomly assigned to treatment with MET (850 mg bid) or EE-CPA containing OC for 4 months. After 2 months washout period, treatments were crossed over. Result(s): Treatment with and OC increased significantly serum CRP concentrations (from 0.77 mg/l [95% CI: 0.70; 2.18] to 1.70 mg/l [95% CI: 1.65; 3.69], P<0.001). Treatment with MET slightly reduced serum CRP levels, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (P=0.08). 4 months treatment with MET or EE-CPA had no effect on serum IL-6 and sVCAM-1 concentrations (P>0.05). Conclusion(s): Treatment with EE-CPA containing OC for 4 months in women with PCOS significantly raises serum CRP. Since this rise was not accompanied by the increase in serum concentrations of IL-6, which is the most potent and effective stimulant of hepatic CRP production, we can speculate that this effect is caused by the liver first-pass effect of oral oestrogen administration. If this in turn can confer, cardiovascular risk among these women warrants further studies. © J. A. Barth Verlag in Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the effects of 4-month treatment of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and Diane-35 on the clinical and biochemical features of hyperandrogenism and quality of life of adolescent girls with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): A prospective, randomized, cross-over study. Setting(s): An accredited pediatric and adolescent gynecology clinic of a university-affiliated tertiary hospital. Participant(s): 76 adolescents girls aged 14 to 19years old with PCOS were recruited from July 2007 to July2010. Intervention(s): Girls were randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 received oral MPA for 4months, followed by a washout period of 4months, and then Diane-35 for another 4months. Group 2 received the same combination but in the reverse order. Main Outcome Measure(s): Clinical and biochemical features of hyperandrogenism and quality of life were assessed. Result(s): There was no significant difference between the 2 groups at baseline. No significant difference was found in the clinical and biochemical parameters of hyperandrogenism before and after treatment with MPA. Significant reduction of the acne score, LH/FSH ratio, and testosterone level was seen after taking Diane-35. Hirsutism was also improved but it did not reach statistical significant. When comparing post-MPA and post-Diane-35, the post-Diane-35 group had significantly improved acne score and LH/FSH ratio. No significant difference was found on quality of life between both groups after treatment. Conclusion(s): Diane-35 may be a more suitable treatment option in adolescent girls diagnosed with PCOS when compared to MPA. © 2014 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

N2  - Purpose: This retrospective cohort study evaluated the cumulative live birth rate in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and isolated polycystic ovaries (PCO) undergoing in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment. Method(s): We studied 104 women with PCOS, 184 with PCO and 576 age-matched controls undergoing the first IVF treatment cycle between 2002 and 2009. The main outcome measure was cumulative live birth in the fresh plus all the frozen embryo transfers combined after the same stimulation cycle. Result(s): Women in both the PCOS (n=104) and isolated PCO groups (n=184) had higher ovarian response parameters compared to age-matched controls (n=576), and higher rates of withholding fresh embryo transfer for risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The actual incidence of moderate to severe OHSS was significantly higher in the PCOS (11.5 %) but not the isolated PCO group (8.2 %) compared to controls (4.9 %). The live birth rates in the fresh cycle were comparable among the 3 groups, but the PCOS group had a significantly higher miscarriage rate compared to the other 2 groups. Cumulative live birth rate was significantly higher in the isolated PCO group (60.3 %), but not the PCOS group (50.0 %), compared to controls (47.5 %). Conclusion(s): Women in the isolated PCO group, but not the PCOS group, had a significantly higher cumulative live birth rate compared to controls. This could be explained by the quantitative effect of the higher number of transferable embryos obtained per stimulation cycle, which is uncompromised by the unfavourable embryo competence otherwise observed in PCOS. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.

N2  - Background & aims: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by ovariandysfunction and hyperandrogenism and by insulin resistance and related metabolicalterations. Both metformin and anti-androgens, such as spironolactone, are used to ameliorate the different aspects of this disorder. We investigated whether therapy with metformin plus low-dose spironolactone is more effective than metformin alone in PCOS patients. Methods and Results: Fifty-six PCOS patients were randomized in two groups: group A (28 patients) was treated with metformin (1700mg/die) and group B (28 patients) was treated with metformin (1700mg/die) plus low-dose spironolactone (25mg/die). Anthropometric, hormonal and metabolic parameters were evaluated at baseline and after six months of treatment. After therapy regular menses were restored in approximately 82% of group Apatients (P<0.001) and in 68% of group B patients (P<0.001). Circulating testosterone, delta-4-androstenedione and Hirsutism Score (HS) significantly decreased in both groups. However, dehydro-epiandrosterone sulphate significantly decreased only in group B, and HS underwent a stronger reduction in group B (P<0.001). At baseline, 39/56 (69.6%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome, but only one patient met these criteria after treatment. Conclusion(s): This study confirms the beneficial effects of metformin in PCOS patients. It also indicates that the addition of low-dose spironolactone induces a more marked reduction of clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism as compared to metformin alone. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Alterations in lipid pattern and increased risk for obstetric/neonatal complications have been observed in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Pregnancy leads to physiologic changes in lipoprotein metabolism, and alterations in lipid profile have been related with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Based on these considerations, the aim of the present prospective controlled clinical study was to test the hypothesis that the changes in the lipid profile in patients with PCOS during pregnancy are characteristic and potentially related to the increased risk of obstetric/neonatal complications. One hundred and fifty nonobese PCOS women and 150 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Serum lipids, glucose, insulin, and androgens levels were serially assayed in all subjects before and throughout pregnancy. Serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride (TG) concentrations were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in PCOS group than in healthy controls at each assessment. Throughout pregnancy, serum LDL and TG levels increased significantly (P < 0.05) in both groups, although the change from pre-pregnancy values was significantly (P < 0.05) greater in PCOS patients than in healthy controls. A significant (P < 0.05) relationship was observed between serum LDL and TG changes and changes in both insulin sensitivity indexes and androgen levels in PCOS patients alone. After adjusting for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI and lipid levels, body weight gain, and insulin-resistance markers, serum TG concentrations during pregnancy were directly and independently associated with obstetric complications in both groups, whereas serum LDL levels only in PCOS patients. We can conclude that nonobese PCOS patients had specific changes in lipid profile during pregnancy, and that the lipid pattern typical of PCOS may account for the more frequent adverse pregnancy outcomes. PCOS-related hormonal and metabolic features, such as insulin resistance and high androgen levels, may mediate this phenomenon. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the combination spironolactone- norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol in hirsutism with other protocols including the same dose of estrogen. STUDY DESIGN: In this open prospective study, 167 women with hirsutism due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were randomly assigned to the following treatment protocols: Group A (n=72): spironolactone 100 mg-norgestimate 250 mcg- ethinyl estradiol 35 mug; Group B (n=70): cyproterone acetate 12 mg-ethinyl estradiol 35 mug; Group C (n=25): norgestimate 250 mug-ethinyl estradiol 35 mug. RESULT(S): The decrease in the hirsutism score was higher in group A than in the other groups (p<0.001) and comparable in groups B and C. The decrease in acne score, androgen and estradiol levels, and ovary volume was similar in groups A and B. C-reactive protein increase was similar in all groups, but the augmentation of fibrinogen (p=0.04), triglycerides (p<0.01), monocyte count (p=0.04), platelet number (p<0.001) and mean volume (p=0.01) was more pronounced in group B than in group A. Low-density lipoprotein/highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ratio decreased in groups A and C. CONCLUSION(S): Spironolactone-norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol is an effective and well-tolerated combination for the treatment of hirsutism in PCOS, with a favorable influence on lipids and indices of low-grade inflammation.Copyright © Journal of Reproductive Medicine, Inc.

N2  - Study Objective: Hirsutism has negative impact on adolescent psychosocial development for both cosmetic and endocrine reasons. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a new intermittent, low-dose finasteride regimen consisting of 2.5mg of drug given every 3days (1day of treatment, 2days of drug withdrawal) for 6months in girls with hirsutism by polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) or idiopathic hirsutism (IH). Design and Participants: Twenty-eight girls (15-19y old) with hirsutism were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups and treated for 6months. Fourteen patients (7 with IH, 7 with PCOS) received finasteride; fourteen patients (7 with IH, 7 with PCOS) received placebo. Hirsutism score (HS), clinical, and hormonal effects were compared between the 2 groups. Result(s): In patients treated with finasteride, the HS value at 6months was 52.9% lower than that observed at baseline in girls with IH, and 52.8% lower in girls with PCOS (P<.0001 for both). Similarly, the 3alpha-17 beta-androstenediol glucuronide serum levels were decreased by 34.8% in patients with IH, and by 47.5% in patients with PCOS (P<.0001, respectively). Finasteride treatment was well tolerated and did not alter values of BMI, serum levels of sexual hormones, metabolic parameters related to liver and kidney function as well as glycemic and lipidic asset. Conclusion(s): A low-dose of finasteride, given every 3days, reduces the HS in young patients affected by PCOS or IH. Compared with conventional continuous finasteride administration, the intermittent low-dose regimen has similar efficacy with the advantage to be safer and less expensive. © 2014 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

N2  - Objective To study the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and to examine the role of hyperandrogenaemia. Design Cohort study. Setting Singleton pregnancies in women with PCOS identified at a private fertility clinic during 1997-2010 and a background population including all singleton deliveries at Hvidovre Hospital, Denmark, in 2005. Population A cohort of 459 women with PCOS and a background population of 5409 women. Methods Obstetric outcomes were extracted from national Danish registries and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusting for age, parity, and body mass index. Main outcome measures Risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, and small for gestational age offspring in the entire PCOS population and in a subsample with hyperandrogenaemia. Results Women with PCOS had an increased risk of preterm delivery <37 weeks of gestation (OR 2.28; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 1.51-3.45; P < 0.0001). The elevated risk was confined to hyperandrogenic women with PCOS: preterm delivery before 37 weeks of gestation (OR 2.78; 95% CI 1.62-4.77; P < 0.0001), and was not seen in normoandrogenic women with PCOS (OR 1.35; 95% CI 0.54-3.39; P = 0.52). The overall risk of pre-eclampsia was not elevated (OR 1.69; 95% CI 0.99-2.88; P = 0.05) compared with the background population, but was significantly increased in the hyperandrogenic subsample (OR 2.41; 95% CI 1.26-4.58; P < 0.001). The risk of small for gestational age offspring was similar in all groups. Conclusion Women with PCOS had an increased risk of preterm delivery compared with the background population. The increased risk was confined to hyperandrogenic women with PCOS who had a two-fold increased risk of preterm delivery and pre-eclampsia. © 2014 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and pregnancy are conditions characterized by an increased low-grade chronic inflammation state. A higher incidence of pregnancy complications has been detected in pregnant PCOS women. Objective(s): The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that the low-grade chronic inflammation state typical of PCOS patients persists during gestation and is exacerbated by pregnancy and contributes to the increased risk of obstetric/neonatal complications. Design(s): This was a prospective controlled clinical study. Setting(s): The study was conducted at the Academic Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the "Pugliese-Ciaccio" Hospital of Catanzaro (Catanzaro, Italy). Patient(s): One hundred fifty pregnant PCOS women and 150 age- and body mass index-matched healthy pregnant controls participated in the study. Intervention(s): Interventions included serial clinical, biochemical, and ultrasonographic assessments before and throughout pregnancy. Main Outcome Measure(s): Serum levels of white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin were measured. Result(s): Pregnant women with PCOS had higher WBC, CRP, and ferritin levels at study entry and at all gestational ages than controls. Changes in serum WBC and ferritin levels were significantly higher in PCOS than in controls starting from the 12thweekof gestation whereas those in CRP from the 20th week of gestation. By multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, in the PCOS group, a significant association with the risk of adverse obstetric/neonatal outcomes was found for WBC [hazard ratio (HR) 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-1.64; P = .010], CRP (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.34; P = .019), and ferritin levels (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.26; P = .011). Conclusion(s): In PCOS patients, the low-grade chronic inflammation persists during gestation and is exacerbated by pregnancy, and it is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

All patients in the four groups were primigravidae and women with PCOS (groups 1 and 3) became pregnant after treatment with clomiphene citrate and/or gonadotropins. Plasma concentrations of fasting glucose, fasting serum insulin, insulin sensitivity by quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), serum concentrations of triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol, (HDL-c), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c); plasma adipocytokines: interleukin (IL)-10, adiponectin (both are insulin sensitizers and anti-inflammatory), pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-6, prothrombin activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); serum total testosterone (TT), sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), free androgen index (FAI) were estimated for the four groups between 22 and 24 weeks' gestation Glucose loading test was done at 22-24 weeks' gestation to check for gestational diabetes mellitus and if normal it was repeated at 30-34 weeks. Gestational hypertension (GH), preeclampsia (PE) and preterm labor (PTL) (delivery <37 weeks' gestation) were recorded., Results Groups 1 and 2 with android obesity had IR/HI, (QUICKI < 0.331 +/- 0.010). Groups 3 and 4 with gynoid obesity had normal insulin sensitivity (NIS), (QUICKI > 0.331 +/- 0.010). Serum concentration of TGs, LDL-c, and plasma concentration of IL-6, PAI-1, hsCRP were significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 than groups 3 and 4. Serum HDL-c, plasma IL-10 and adiponectin were significantly higher in groups 3 and 4 than groups 1 and 2. Serum TT and FAI were significantly higher in groups 1 and 3 (cases of PPCOS) than their controls. There was no significant difference in the serum concentration of TC between the four groups. Incidence of spontaneous early miscarriage (SM) in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 36%, 12%, 33%, and 11% respectively. Incidence of SM was significantly higher in PPCOS than non-PCOS pregnancy irrespective of the type of obesity. Rate of late pregnancy complications, GDM, GH, PE and PTL was significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 with android obesity than groups 3 and 4 with gynoid obesity. There was no significant difference in the rates of cesarean section (CS) between the 4 groups. The rates of neonatal complications and perinatal mortality were significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 (android obesity) than groups 3 and 4 (gynoid obesity)., Conclusion TT and FAI were significantly higher in PPCOS with android obesity than PPCOS with gynoid obesity.Incidence of early SM (9-12 weeks) was significantly higher in PPCOS than in non-PCOS pregnancy irrespective of the type of obesity.Incidence of late-onset pregnancy complications, GDM, GH, PE and PTL was significantly higher in patients with android obesity than patients with gynoid obesity. PCOS per se seemed to be not related to the incidence of late-onset pregnancy complications.Pregnant patients with android obesity, (both PCOS and non-PCOS) with diminished serum concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and increased serum concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines had IR/HI and dyslipidemia. Pregnant patients with gynoid obesity, (both PCOS and non-PCOS) with normal serum concentration of anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines had NIS and normal lipid profile.In pregnancy with android obesity patients had reduced plasma concentration of IL-10 and increased concentration of IL-6 which may impair the development of the placenta with increased risk of PTL.Neonatal complications and perinatal mortality were significantly higher in PPCOS with android obesity than PPCOS with gynoid obesity.Copyright © 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous endocrine disorder frequently accompanied by obesity and by insulin resistance, and patients with this syndrome suffer from infertility and poor pregnancy outcome. Disturbances in plasma amino acid (AA) metabolism have been implicated in women with PCOS. However, direct evidence on follicular AA metabolic profiles in PCOS patients and their relationship with pregnancy outcome is sparse. Method(s): We conducted a prospective study in 63 PCOS patients and 48 controls in the Division of Reproductive Center, Peking University Third Hospital. Follicular AA levels were measured by the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method, and the results were analyzed based on different grouping criteria. Result(s): The levels of aromatic amino acid (AAA) increased in PCOS patients independent of obesity (P < 0.05), whereas the levels of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), glutamic acid, phenylalanine, alanine, and arginine increased with body mass index irrespective of the PCOS status (all P < 0.05). In addition, compared with non insulin resistant-PCOS patients and controls, insulin resistant-PCOS group had higher levels of leucine, valine and glutamic acid (all P < 0.05). In PCOS group, aspartic acid and serine levels were elevated in pregnant patients compared with the non-pregnant subjects (both P < 0.05). Moreover, the levels of BCAA and valine were higher in the non-pregnant group than in the pregnant group (both P < 0.05). The pregnancy rate (45.00%) of subjects with elevated BCAA level was significantly lower than that (66.67%) in control subjects (P = 0.036) at a BCAA cutoff value of 239.10 muM, while the abortion rate was much higher (33.33% versus 2.78%, P = 0.004). Conclusion(s): Both PCOS and obesity were accompanied by follicular AA metabolic disturbances, with obesity exerting a more pronounced effect on AA metabolic profiles. The disruptions in specific AAs in the follicular fluid might account for the inferior pregnancy outcome in obese patients and increased risk of abortion in PCOS patients. © 2014 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Context: Central obesity in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased inflammatory markers and increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Objective(s): The objective of the study was to evaluate whether treatment with metformin (M) or M combined with oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) resulted in a more advantageous body composition than treatment with OCP alone. Setting(s): The study was conducted at an outpatient clinic. Patients and Interventions: This was a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Ninety patients with PCOS were randomized to 12 months' treatment with M(2 g/d), M+OCP (150 mg desogestrel+30 mug ethinylestradiol), or OCP. Whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans and clinical and hormonal evaluations were performed before and after the intervention period. A total of 65 of 90 patients completed the study. Main Outcome Measure(s): Changes in weight at 6 and 12 months and changes in regional fat mass estimates at 12 months were measured. Result(s): Dropout rates between intervention groups were not significantly different. Treatment with M and M+OCP were superior to OCP regarding weight and regional fat mass. The median (quartiles) weight changes during 12 months of M, M+OCP, and OCP treatment were -3.0 (-10.3; 0.6), -1.9 (-4.9; 0.1), and 1.2 (-0.8; 3.0) kg, respectively, P<.05. Upper to lower fat mass ratio was unchanged. Changes in body composition were predicted by the type of medical intervention (M, M+OCP, or OCP) and not by body mass index at study inclusion. OCP and M+OCP were superior to M regarding reduction in free T levels. Conclusion(s): M treatment alone or in combination with OCP was associated with weight loss and improved body composition compared with OCP, whereas free T levels decreased during M+OCP or OCP. Combined treatment with M+OCP should be considered as an alternative to treatment with OCP alone to avoid weight gain in PCOS. Copyright © 2014 by the Endocrine Society.

N2  - Objective: To compare the effects of oral contraceptives (OCPs) and metformin on atherogenic markers, including serum levels of advanced glycated end products (AGEs) and Creactive protein (CRP), in lean women (Body Mass Index below 25 kg/m2) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), defined by NIH criteria. Design(s): Prospective open-label study. Result(s): One hundred and twenty women with PCOS were treated for 6 months with one of the following treatments: ethinylestradiol plus cyproterone acetate (OCP 1, n=40) or ethinylestradiol plus drospirenone (OCP2, n=40) or metformin (MET, n=40). The three groups were age and BMI-matched (mean age: 22 +/- 0.56 yrs in group OCP1; 23.24 +/- 0.64 yrs in group OCP2; 21.50 +/- 0.53 yrs in group MET; mean BMI 21.80 +/- 0.35 kg/m2 in group OCP1; 22.37 +/- 0.48 kg/m2 in group OCP2; 23.03 +/- 0.67 kg/m2 in group MET). At 6 months serum AGEs were decreased in group OCP1 (P=0.005) and group MET (P=0.001), whereas these were marginally decreased in group OCP2 (P=0.069). Treatment with metformin was associated with a greater percent decrease of AGEs. CRP was decreased with metformin (P<0.001), but was increased with OCPs (P<0.001). Conclusion(s): This study evaluates common therapeutic options in women with PCOS by reconsidering and prioritizing the goals of treatment. OCPs and metformin appear to have differential effects on atherogenic molecules in lean PCOS patients, but metformin was superior in reducing serum AGEs and CRP. Clinicians should individualize the benefit-to-risk ratio of pharmaceutical intervention in women with PCOS in order to choose the formulation with the greatest overall efficacy as well as safety in terms of cardiovascular risk.Copyright © 2014 Hellenic Endocrine Society.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Hyperandrogenic conditions in women are associated with increased rates of miscarriage. However, the specific role of maternal testosterone in early pregnancy and its association with pregnancy outcome is unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare serum testosterone levels during early pregnancy in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who either had successful pregnancies or miscarried., METHOD: We collected serum samples from women attending a university-based fertility centre at the time of their first positive serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test. The samples were subsequently assayed for total testosterone level. We used logistical regression modelling to control for PCOS diagnosis, BMI, and age., RESULTS: Total testosterone levels were available for 346 pregnancies, including 286 successful pregnancies and 78 first trimester miscarriages. We found no difference in total testosterone levels between women who subsequently had an ongoing pregnancy (mean concentration 3.6 +/- 2.6 nmol/L) and women with a miscarriage (mean 3.6 +/- 2.4 nmol/L). Using the Rotterdam criteria to identify women with PCOS, we also found no differences in serum testosterone between women who had ongoing pregnancies or miscarriages, either with PCOS (P = 0.176) or without PCOS (P = 0.561)., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that early pregnancy testosterone levels do not predict pregnancy outcome, and they call into question the role of testosterone in causing miscarriage in populations of women with PCOS. Further research is needed to elucidate the normal progression of testosterone levels during pregnancy and to investigate further the relationship between PCOS and miscarriage.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Hormones, particularly androgens play a vital role in hair growth, differentiation and distribution. Hirsutism is a common entity among Nepalese population with skin types III, IV and V. Long pulsed lasers are commonly used for hair removal., METHODS: This is a prospective analytical study done in Dhulikhel Hospital Kathmandu University Hospital, Kavre, Nepal from November 2010 to November 2011. Patients were first subjected to hormonal evaluation. Androgens, their tropic hormones, insulin resistance markers and endocrine components were measured and compared. Subjects were then categorized into two groups according to androgen levels: group A (n=30) with significantly high androgen (total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) or elevated luteinizing hormone: follicle stimulating hormone ratio, consistent with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and group B (n=30). Adrenal tumour was ruled out in all patients. All patients received long pulse Nd-YAG laser (50J/cm2; 50 msec pulse duration) therapy at four weeks interval to achieve at least 50% hair reduction., RESULTS: Among group A patients, average 8.1 treatment sessions were required for substantial hair reduction, whereas, average 5.7 sessions produced similar results in group B patients (p-value <0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with high androgen level and elevated LH: FSH ratio requires more treatment sessions for hair removal with long pulsed ND-YAG laser than patients with normal or low hormone level.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the long-term effects of drospirenone (DRSP)/ethinylestradiol (EE) alone, metformin alone, and DRSP/ EE-metformin on CD4+CD28null T lymphocytes frequency, a cardiovascular risk marker, in patients with hyperinsulinemic polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Randomized clinical trial. Intervention(s): Ninety three patients with hyperinsulinemic PCOS were age matched and body mass index matched and randomized to receive a 6 months daily treatment with DRSP (3 mg)/EE (0.03 mg), or metformin (1500 mg), or DRSP/EE combined with metformin. Main Outcome Measure(s): CD4+CD28null T-cell frequencies. Result(s): The DRSP/EE and metformin groups did not show any significant change in the CD 4+CD28null frequency compared to the baseline. Interestingly, a statistically significant decrease in CD4+CD28 null frequency occurred after 6 months of DRSP/EE-metformin (median 3-1.5; P < .01). Of note, this statistically significant association was confirmed after adjusting for baseline values in DRSP/EE-metformin group by analysis of covariance (P < .05). Conclusion(s): In women with hyperinsulinemic PCOS, combined therapy with DRSP/EE and metformin may reduce cardiovascular risk. © The Author(s) 2013.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effects the administration of myo-inositol (MYO) on hormonal parameters in a group of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. Design(s): Controlled clinical study. Setting(s): PCOS patients in a clinical research environment. Patient(s): 50 overweight PCOS patients were enrolled after informed consent. Intervention(s): All patients underwent hormonal evaluations and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) before and after 12 weeks of therapy (Group A (n=10): MYO 2 g plus folic acid 200 mg every day; Group B (n=10): folic acid 200 mg every day). Ultrasound examinations and Ferriman-Gallwey score were also performed. Main Outcome Measure(s): Plasma LH, FSH, PRL, E2, 17OHP, A, T, glucose, insulin, C peptide concentrations, BMI, HOMA index and glucose-to-insulin ratio. Result(s): After 12 weeks of MYO administration plasma LH, PRL, T, insulin levels and LH/FSH resulted significantly reduced. Insulin sensitivity, expressed as glucose-to-insulin ratio and HOMA index resulted significantly improved after 12 weeks of treatment. Menstrual cyclicity was restored in all amenorrheic and oligomenorrheic subjects. No changes occurred in the patients treated with folic acid. Conclusion(s): MYO administration improves reproductive axis functioning in PCOS patients reducing the hyperinsulinemic state that affects LH secretion. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The aim of this study was to compare the effect of low-dose metformin and rosiglitazone on clinical, biochemical, ultrasound features and endothelial function in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). After randomisation, a group of 17 women received metformin 500 mg b.d. (MG) and a group of 18 received rosiglitazone 4 mg o.d. (RG) for 3 months. Serum FSH, LH, testosterone, fasting glucose, insulin, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, CRP were measured at baseline and follow-up. Ovarian scan and microcirculation studies were also performed. It was found that there was a reduction in hyperandrogenaemia, insulin resistance, lipidaemia, CRP levels, ovarian volume and number of follicles in both groups. No improvement in endothelial- dependent function was noted but a significant improvement in endothelial-independent function in rosiglitazone group. It was concluded that low-dose therapeutic regimen with rosiglitazone and metformin, has comparable beneficial impacts on metabolic, hormonal and morphological features of PCOS but no obvious effect on vascular parameters in a population of predominantly mild PCOS. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Aim: The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of Metformin compared with a hypocaloric diet on C-reactive protein (CRP) level and markers of insulin resistance in obese and overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Material(s) and Method(s): Fortywomenwith body mass index >= 27 andPCOSwere randomly allocated to receive either Metformin or hypocaloric diet and were assessed before and after a treatment period of 12 weeks. High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and markers of insulin resistance (IR), homeostasis model assessment-IR, quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index and fasting glucose to insulin ratio were evaluated in each patient. Result(s): A total of 10 subjects did not complete the trial (three patients in the Metformin group and seven patients in the diet group) and a total of 30 subjects completed the trial (17 subjects in the Metformin group and 13 subjects in the diet group). Serum concentration of hs-CRP significantly decreased in both the Metformin (5.29 +/- 2.50 vs 3.81 +/- 1.99, P = 0.008) and diet groups (6.08 +/- 2.14 vs 4.27 +/- 1.60, P = 0.004). There were no significant differences in mean hs-CRP decrement between the two groups. Decrease in hs-CRP levels was significantly correlated with waist circumference in the diet group (r = 0.8, P < 0.001). The effect of a hypocaloric diet with 5-10% weight reduction on markers of insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment-IR, fasting glucose to insulin ratio, quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index) was better than Metformin therapy (P = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Although weight reduction has equal efficacy with Metformin in decreasing serumhs-CRP levels, it was significantly more effective in improving insulin resistance in obese and overweight PCOS women. © 2012 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

N2  - Objectives. To evaluate pregnancy outcomes and its determinants in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods. Two-hundred and twenty pregnant PCOS and 594 healthy women were followed from early pregnancy. Incidences of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), preterm birth, twinning, and fetal growth restriction (FGR) were determined. Results. The incidence of GDM was notably higher among all PCOS combined (54.9%; OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 2.0-4.1) and PCOS subgroups, whether they conceived spontaneously (51.5%; OR: 3.3, 95% CI: 2.0-5.4), or via IVF-ET or ovarian stimulation, compared with controls (14.3%; P < 0.001). The incidence of PIH was also higher among all PCOS (10.4%; OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1-4.4) and the subgroup conceiving spontaneously (11.8%; OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.1-6.2; P < 0.001) but not for those conceiving with IVF-ET (9.1%) or ovarian stimulation (9.4%). Lean women with PCOS (BMI < 24 kg/m2) had higher incidences of GDM (51.1% versus 14.5%; OR: 5.6, 95% CI: 3.4-9.0) and PIH (8.9% versus 3.2%; OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.3-7.1) than lean controls. PCOS woemn with normal glucose tolerance had higher risk for PIH than their comparable control group (OR: 4.0, 95% CI: 1.3-11.7). Conclusion. This study suggested that PCOS is an independent risk factor for the development of GDM and PIH. This trial is registered with ChiCTR-RCC-11001824. © 2013 Yunhui Wang et al.

N2  - Objective: To study oxidative stress (OS) markers on neonates. The specific aim was to evaluate advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) serum levels along with the hormonal/metabolic profile and their possible relationship in a cohort of polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS(N) and gestational diabetes GDM(N) neonates and their mothers PCOS(M) and GDM(M). Design(s): Prospective controlled study. Setting(s): Academic medical center. Patient(s): The study population comprised 151 mother/neonate pairs. Intervention(s): Diet and/or insulin administration in GDM(M). Main Outcome Measure(s): Anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal parameters, and OS markers. Result(s): The AGEs and AOPPs were higher in PCOS(M) and GDM(M) compared with controls (M). The same significant difference was observed in the corresponding groups of neonates. A strong relationship between mothers and neonates regarding AGEs (r = 0.605) and AOPPs levels (r = 0.735) was disclosed. Analogous findings were observed regarding androgens and insulin resistance in mothers and neonates, respectively. Conclusion(s): The present study demonstrated that in PCOS(N), the OS status was similar to that of GDM(N) and strongly associated with their mothers' oxidative status. These findings may have clinical implications, as exposure of PCOS(N) to high OS levels during pregnancy could affect several health issues of neonates. ©2013 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Context: To improve the treatment outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), various drugs like glitazones, oral contraceptive pills, or antiandrogens have been combined with metformin. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of the combination of low-dose spironolactone and metformin with either drug alone in the management of women with PCOS. Design and Setting: The present study was an open-label, randomized study conducted at a tertiary care referral center. Patients and Intervention: Of 204 women who met the 2006 Androgen Excess-PCOS criteria for PCOS, 198 were randomized into 3 equal groups to receive metformin (1000 mg/d), low-dose spironolactone (50 mg/d), or a combination of both drugs for a period of 6 months. A total of 169 subjects (n - 56 metformin, 51 spironolactone, 62 combination) completed the study. Main Outcome Measure(s): Menstrual cycle pattern, Ferriman-Gallwey score, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio, blood pressure, LH, FSH, total T, glucose and insulin sensitivity indices were measured at baseline (0 mo) and 3 and 6 months after the intervention. Recording of adverse events and drug compliance was assessed at each of the visits. Result(s): The 3 groups had comparable mean age and BMI at baseline. By 6 months, menstrual cycles/y increased, whereas Ferriman-Gallwey score, serum total T, and area under the curveglucose and -insulin decreased significantly (P - .05) in the combination group as compared to either drug alone. There was no significant change in body weight, BMI, waist-hip ratio, and blood pressure in any of the 3 groups. The combination group had better compliance than either drug alone, and the adverse event rate was not higher. Conclusion(s): The combination of low-dose spironolactone with metformin seems superior to either drug alone in terms of clinical benefits and compliance in women with PCOS.

T1  - Metformin and pioglitazone in polycystic ovarian syndrome: A comparative study
A1  - Sangeeta S. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the effect of metformin and pioglitazone on insulin resistance, ovulation and hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS. Method(s): 100 patients of age 18-30 years were included in this randomised double blind trial for treatment with either metformin or pioglitazone for a period of 6 months. Result(s): Administration of metformin and pioglitazone for 6 months revealed that 50 % of the patients achieved menstrual cyclicity. A decline in F-G grading for hirsutism within the both the groups was observed. The lipid profile also showed a decrease in total cholesterol, an increase in HDL-C, a decrease in VLDL-C levels but more so in the pioglitazone group. HOMA-IR declined more than 50-55 % with pioglitazone and 15 % with metformin. Thus, pioglitazone may be a better treatment option as far as protection from tendency to development of diabetes is conscerned. The rise in serum SHBG levels and decline in free androgen index and L/H ratio are more remarkable with pioglitazone (P < 0.05). Ovulation was restored in 44.2 and 56 % of patients on metformin and pioglitazone, respectively. Conclusion(s): Pioglitazone may be a new alternative for use in women with PCOS, providing more metabolic and reproductive benefits and possibly protection from developing diabetes and cardiovascular problem. © 2012 Federation of Obstetric & Gynecological Societies of India.

N2  - Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous clinical condition. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) have conventionally been the mainstay of treatment for the amelioration of hyperandrogenism and regulation of menstrual cycles in women with PCOS. Metformin has beneficial effects on insulin resistance and endothelial functions. To our knowledge, the effect of metformin/OCP combination treatment on aortic stiffness has not been studied so far. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of treatment with drospirenone/ethinyl oestradiol (E/E) alone or in combination with metformin on the elastic properties of the aorta in women with PCOS. Methods Thirty-seven women with PCOS were enrolled in the study. The first treatment arm, which was treated with OCP alone, was described as the OCP group (19 patients, mean age: 23.2 +/- 5.4); the other treatment arm, which was treated with OCP and metformin, was described as the combination group (18 patients, mean age: 23.0 +/- 4.5). The elastic parameters of the aorta namely 'aortic strain', 'aortic distensibility', 'aortic diameter alteration' and 'aortic stiffness index' were calculated by the appropriate formulae. The hormonal profile, HOMA-IR score, basal insulin and glucose levels were studied in both groups. Before and after 6 months of treatment, echocardiographic measurements and laboratory tests were also obtained. Results After 6 months of treatment, significant weight loss and decrease in body mass index (BMI) were observed in the combination group (75.3 +/- 13.3 kg to 72.3 +/- 13.5 kg and 31.7 +/- 7.3 kg/m2 vs 30.4 +/- 7.3 kg/m2, P = 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). Conversely in the OCP group, BMI and weight were not significantly different after 6 months of treatment (68.8 +/- 18.3 kg to 71.6 +/- 21.2 kg and 26.4 +/- 6.2 kg/m2 to 27.4 +/- 6.9 kg/m2, P = 0.159 and P = 0.149, respectively). In addition, there were no significant differences in aortic strain, distensibility (7.7 +/- 4.2 to 7.8 +/- 3.6 and 7.2 +/- 4.1 to 7.7 +/- 3.6, P = 0.926 and P = 0.593, respectively) and stiffness index in the OCP group (8.8 +/- 7.4 to 8.2 +/- 6.7, P = 0.772). However, in the combination group, the adjusted values of the aortic stiffness index decreased significantly at the 6 months' follow-up (10.0 +/- 1.5 to 6.7 +/- 0.3, P = 0.021) and aortic distensibility and strain increased but not significantly (7.0 +/- 4.3 to 9.3 +/- 3.3 and 6.8 +/- 3.9 to 9.4 +/- 3.5, P = 0.163 and P = 0.071, respectively) at the 6 months' follow-up. Conclusion We demonstrated an improvement in the elastic parameters of the aorta by adding metformin to OCP treatment. We suggest that metformin plus OCP treatment may decrease cardiovascular disease risk in women with PCOS. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

T1  - The combined therapy with myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol reduces the risk of metabolic disease in PCOS overweight patients compared to myo-inositol supplementation alone
A1  - Nordio M.
A1  - Proietti E. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - PCOS is the main cause of infertility due to metabolic, hormonal and ovarian dysfunctions. Women affected by PCOS often suffer of insulin resistance and of a compensatory hyperinsulinemia. These conditions put the patients at risk of developing several metabolic disorders. Both myo-inositol (MI) and D-chiro inositol (DCI) glycans administration has been reported to exert beneficial effects at metabolic, hormonal and ovarian level. Beside these common features, MI and DCI are indeed different molecules: they belong to two different signal cascades and regulate different biological processes. In this study, we aim to verify whether the two molecules have a synergistic action by acting on their specific cellular pathways. The effectiveness in reducing the risk of metabolic syndrome as well as in enhancing the ovarian functions of a combined therapy with MI and DCI was compared to a mono therapy in a randomized controlled trial. Fifty overweight women with PCOS were enrolled and divided in two groups to receive MI and DCL (MI+DCI group) or MI alone (MI group) for a period of six months. Baseline measurements were repeated at three months (T1) and at the end of the treatment (T2). At the end of the treatment, both MI and MI+DCI groups showed an improvement of the metabolic parameters and no significant differences were found. As expected, the combined supplementation with MI and DCI resulted to be more effective, compared to the MI group, after three months of treatment. The combined administration of MI and DCI in physiological plasma ratio (40:1) should be considered as the first line approach in PCOS overweight patients, being able to reduce the metabolic and clinical alteration of PCOS and, therefore, reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder associated with metabolic dysfunction and changes in cardiovascular risk markers, and using oral contraceptives (OCs) may exert a further negative effect on these alterations in patients with PCOS. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to assess the effects on arterial function and structure of an OC containing chlormadinone acetate (2 mg) and ethinylestradiol (30 mcg), alone or combined with spironolactone (OC+SPL), in patients with PCOS. Study Design: This was a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Fifty women with PCOS between 18 and 35 years of age were randomized by a computer program to use OC or OC+SPL. Brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation, carotid intima-media thickness and the carotid artery stiffness index were evaluated at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. Serum markers for cardiovascular disease were also analyzed. The intragroup data were analyzed using analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc test. A multivariate linear regression model was used to analyze the intergroup data. Result(s): At 12 months, the increase in mean total cholesterol levels was greater in the OC+SPL group than in the OC group (27% vs. 13%, respectively; p=.02). The increase in mean sex hormone-binding globulin levels was greater in the OC group than in the OC+SPL group (424% vs. 364%, respectively; p=.01). No statistically significant differences between the groups were found for any of the other variables. Conclusion(s): The addition of spironolactone to an OC containing chlormadinone acetate and ethinylestradiol conferred no cardiovascular risk-marker advantages in young women with PCOS. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective:To examine the risk and etiology of preterm delivery in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Study Design:Retrospective cohort study comparing preterm delivery rate among non-diabetic PCOS and non-PCOS women with singleton pregnancy. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of preterm delivery among PCOS women. Result(s):Among 908 PCOS women with singleton pregnancy, 12.9% delivered preterm compared with 7.4% among non-PCOS women (P0.01). Causes of preterm delivery among PCOS women included preterm labor (41%), cervical insufficiency (11%), hypertensive complications (20%), preterm premature rupture of membranes (15%), fetal-placental concerns (9%) and intrauterine fetal demise (5%). Maternal age, race/ethnicity and nulliparity were significant predictors of preterm delivery in PCOS, whereas body mass index and fertility medications were not. Conclusion(s):A higher proportion of PCOS women delivered preterm (12.9%) compared with non-PCOS women, with the majority of cases due to spontaneous preterm birth. Future studies should explore etiologies and strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes in PCOS. © 2012 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: Possibly due to a deficiency of insulin mediators, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is often associated with insulin resistance (IR) and hyperinsulinemia, likely responsible for an elevated production of reactive oxygen species. We investigated oxidative-related alterations in erythrocytes and anti-inflammatory effects of inositol in women with PCOS before and after treatment with myo-inositol (MYO). Method(s): Twenty-six normal-weight PCOS patients were investigated before and after MYO administration (1200 mg/day for 12 weeks; n = 18) or placebo (n = 8) by evaluating serum testosterone, serum androstenedione, fasting serum insulin, fasting serum glucose, insulin area under the curve (AUC), and glucose AUC after oral glucose tolerance test and homeostasis model of assessment-IR. In erythrocytes, band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr-P) level, glutathione (GSH) content, and glutathionylated proteins (GSSP) were also assessed. Result(s): Data show that PCOS patients' erythrocytes underwent oxidative stress as indicated by band 3 Tyr-P values, reduced cytosolic GSH content, and increased membrane protein glutathionylation. MYO treatment significantly improved metabolic and biochemical parameters. Significant reductions were found in IR and serum values of androstenedione and testosterone. A significant association between band 3 Tyr-P levels and insulin AUC was found at baseline but disappeared after MYO treatment, while a correlation between band 3 Tyr-P and testosterone levels was detected both before and after MYO treatment. Conclusion(s): PCOS patients suffer from a systemic inflammatory status that induces erythrocyte membrane alterations. Treatment with MYO is effective in reducing hormonal, metabolic, and oxidative abnormalities in PCOS patients by improving IR. © 2012 European Society of Endocrinology.

N2  - OBJECTIVE - To test the hypothesis that the risk of persistent glucose impairment after gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increased in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The prospective case-control study included 42 pregnant patients with PCOS and GDM and 84 pregnant control patients with GDM but without clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries, and oligo-anovulation. The case and control subjects were matched one to two for age and BMI. The glycemic profiles were studied in all subjects 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 18 months after delivery. The incidence and the relative risk (RR) were calculated for overall persistence of an abnormal glycemic pattern and for each specific alteration, i.e., impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and diabetes mellitus (DM). RESULTS - At 18 months after delivery, the incidences of IFG, IGT, and IFG-IGT were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the cases than in the controls. At the 18-month follow-up, the RR for the composite outcome of glucose metabolism impairment in PCOS women was 3.45 (95% CI 1.82-6.58). CONCLUSIONS - Patients with PCOS are at increased risk for a persistent impaired glucose metabolism after GDM. © 2012 by the American Diabetes Association.

N2  - Background: The role of metformin in the treatment of infertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is still controversial. Objective and Outcomes: We investigated whether metformin decreases the early miscarriage rate and improves the pregnancy rates (PR) and live-birth rates (LBR) in PCOS. Method(s): This was a multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Three hundred twenty women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility were randomized to metformin (n = 160, Diformin; obese women, 1000 mg two times daily; nonobese subjects, 500 mg + 1000 mg daily) or identical doses of placebo (n = 160). After 3 months'treatment, another appropriate infertility treatment was combined if necessary. If pregnancy occurred, metformin/placebo was continued up to the 12th week. Result(s): Miscarriage rates were low and similar in the two groups (metformin 15.2% vs. placebo 17.9%,P= 0.8). Intent-to-treat analysis showed that metformin significantly improved PR and LBR (vs. placebo) in the whole study population (PR:53.6 vs. 40.4%, P = 0.006; LBR:41.9 vs. 28.8%, P = 0.014) and PR in obese women (49.0 vs. 31.4%,P= 0.04), and there was a similar trend in nonobese (PR:58.6 vs. 47.6%, P = 0.09; LBR:46.7 vs. 34.5%, P = 0.09) and in obese women with regard to LBR (35.7 vs. 21.9%, P = 0.07). Cox regression analysis showed that metformin plus standard infertility treatment increased the chance of pregnancy 1.6 times (hazard rate 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.13-2.27). Conclusion(s): Obese women especially seem to benefit from 3 months' pretreatment with metformin and its combination thereafter with routine ovulation induction in anovulatory infertility.

N2  - Objective: To study the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in Mexican women with a history of infertility and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared with women without PCOS matched by age, pregestational body mass index (BMI), and parity. Design(s): Historic cohort study. Setting(s): Level three medical institution. Patient(s): Group 1 (n = 52), women with a history of infertility and PCOS, and group 2 (n = 52), women without PCOS. Inclusion criteria were singleton pregnancy with <=13 weeks of gestation. Exclusion criteria were pregestational diabetes mellitus and/or concomitant diseases. Intervention(s): Diagnosis of GDM was based on a 3-hour, 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) performed during the second trimester. Main Outcome Measure(s): Incidence and relative risk (RR) for GDM. Result(s): The incidence of GDM was 26.9% and 9.6% for groups 1 and 2, respectively (RR = 2.8; 95% confidence interval 1.08-7.2). No other between-group differences were observed in the incidence of miscarriage, preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, preeclampsia, stillbirth, fetal malformations, or small or large for gestational age newborns. Conclusion(s): Pregnant Mexican women with a history of infertility and PCOS are at increased risk for developing GDM. This risk should be considered beginning early in the second trimester for a timely intervention and to improve the maternal-fetal prognosis. © 2012 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a frequent reproductive and metabolic disorder associated with insulin resistance (IR). Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline derivative alkaloid extracted from Chinese medicinal herbs that has been used as an insulin sensitizer. BBR may have a potential therapeutic value for PCOS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of BBR in comparison to metformin (MET) on the metabolic features of women with PCOS. Design and methods: Eighty-nine subjects with PCOS and IR subjects were randomized into one of three treatment groups: BBR+compound cyproterone acetate (CPA; n = 31), MET+CPA (n =3 0), and placebo+CPA (n = 28) for 3 months. Clinical characteristics of the women and metabolic and hormonal parameters were assessed before and after the period of treatment. Result(s): Treatment with BBR in comparison to MET showed decrease in waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; P < 0.01), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC; P < 0.05) as well as increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG; P < 0.05). Similarly, treatment with BBR in comparison to placebo showed decrease in WHR, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment for IR, area under the curve of insulin, TC, LDLC, and TG (P < 0.05) as well as increase in HDLC and SHBG (P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): Intake of BBR improved some of the metabolic and hormonal derangements in a group of treated Chinese women with PCOS. Main effects could be related to the changes in body composition in obesity and dyslipidemia. Further controlled studies are needed for the assessment of the potential favorable metabolic effects of BBR in women with PCOS. © 2012 European Society of Endocrinology.

N2  - Objective: To compare the effects of oral contraceptive pills containing desogestrel, cyproterone acetate, and drospirenone, in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), after 6 and 12 months of therapy. Design(s): Double-blind randomized controlled trial. Setting(s): Gynecologic clinic of the first author. Patient(s): Women (n = 171) with PCOS (Androgen Excess Society criteria, 2006). Intervention(s): The three-arm trial involved 58, 56, and 57 cases in desogestrel, cyproterone acetate, and drospirenone groups, respectively. Body mass index, abdominal circumference, hirsutism score (modified Ferriman Galwey), acne and acanthosis nigricans scores, and blood pressure were noted. Blood levels of total T, sex hormone-binding globulin, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin were measured. Free androgen index, glucose-insulin ratio, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance were calculated. Follow-up was after 6 and 12 months of treatment. Main Outcome Measure(s): Primarily, absolute change in the Free Androgen Index score between the three groups and, secondarily, changes in the clinical and other hormonal and biochemical parameters were studied. Result(s): Six months of treatment showed similar effects. After 12 months, cyproterone acetate significantly decreased the modified Ferriman Galwey score (change = -5.29) compared with both desogestrel (change = -1.69) and drospirenone (change = -2.12); cyproterone acetate significantly increased sex hormone-binding globulin (change = 142.91) compared with desogestrel (change = 99.53); drospirenone significantly increased sex hormone-binding globulin (change = 131.52) compared with desogestrel; and cyproterone acetate significantly decreased the Free Androgen Index (change = -10.57) compared with desogestrel (change = -5.58). Conclusion(s): No difference in effects after 6 months. At 12 months, cyproterone acetate showed the strongest antiandrogen activities. Effects on metabolic parameters were identical. © 2012 American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objectives: To prospectively evaluate the safety of metformin administration during pregnancy in a group of PCOS patients by assessing its effect on the prevalence of gestational complications and neonatal outcome. Study design: Our prospective, single centre study included 98 pregnant women with PCOS treated with metformin throughout pregnancy and 110 normal pregnant controls. All PCOS patients were hyperinsulinemic and received metformin (1700-3000 mg/day) before conception and until 37 weeks' gestation. Result(s): Metformin treatment in the pregnant PCOS patients resulted in significant decrease in miscarriage rate (9.1% vs 20%; p < 0.05), gestational diabetes (0 vs 13%; p < 0.005), and gestational hypertension (0 vs 11%; p < 0.005) and a non-significant decrease in pre-eclampsia (0 vs 3%; p = .24), compared to the control group. Mean neonatal Apgar score, weight and length were comparable between the two groups. Conclusion(s): Continuing metformin therapy throughout pregnancy resulted in significant reduction in pregnancy complications with concomitant improved neonatal outcome, with no serious deleterious side effects. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Objectives: To assess the value of uterine artery Doppler screening during pregnancy in predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): A prospective case control study. Setting(s): Obstetrics and Gynecology and Medical Biochemistry departments, Zagazig University Hospital, Egypt. Method(s): Forty pregnant women with ovulatory PCOS (PCOS group) and 40 age- and body mass index-matched healthy pregnant controls (control group) underwent serial Doppler velocimetry measurements of the uterine artery, measurements of free androgen index and fasting glucose/insulin ratio during first and late second trimesters. Main Outcome Measure(s): Blood flow impedance indices, free androgen index, fasting glucose/insulin ratio and pregnancy outcomes. Student's t-test, chi2-test, and specificity and sensitivity tests were used for statistical analysis of the data. Result(s): Patients with PCOS had a significantly higher level of testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, free androgen index, fasting glucose/fasting insulin level in the first and late second trimesters (P <= 0.05). A significantly (P < 0.05) higher PI value was observed in the PCOS group than in the control group in the first and late second trimesters. At 26 weeks of gestation 27.2% of pregnant patients with PCOS had a notch on either side, comparing with 12.8% of the control group. The rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes was significantly higher in pregnant patients with PCOS 45% versus 10% in the control group. Conclusion(s): Uterine artery Doppler indices have a higher predictive value for abnormal pregnancy outcomes in pregnant patients with PCOS. © 2011 Middle East Fertility Society.

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infertility due to menstrual dysfunction, and the most promising treatments for this disease are insulin sensitising agents. Myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol are insulin sensitizing agents used in PCOS treatment. In the present paper, we aimed to compare the effects myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol on oocyte quality in euglycemic PCOS patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty-four euglycemic PCOS patients, undergoing ovulation induction for ICSI, were recruited for this study. Forty-three participants received Myo-Inositol 2 g twice a day and forty-one patients received D-chiro inositol 0.6 g twice a day. Result(s): The results of our study showed that the total number of oocytes retrieved did not differ in the two treatments groups. However, the number of mature oocytes was significantly increased in the myo-inositol group compared to D-chiro-inositol. Concurrently, the number of immature oocytes decreased in myo-inositol treated patients. Furthermore, the myo-inositol-treated group showed an increase in the mean number of top quality embryos and in the total number of pregnancies compared to the D-chiro-inositol-treated group. Conclusion(s): Our data show that, in PCOS patients having a normal insulin response, myo-inositol treatment rather than D-chiro-inositol is able to improve oocyte and embryo quality during ovarian stimulation protocols.

N2  - Our aim was to evaluate the optimal treatment strategy addressing cardiovascular risk in obese and nonobese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We planned a prospective randomized clinical study. Normoandrogenemic and oligoamenorrheic women with PCOS and impaired glucose tolerance (n = 96) were enrolled in the study. Six months of treatment with metformin HCL or oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) were given to the patients. Group 1 were obese and receiving metformin. Group 2 were obese and receiving OCPs. Group 3 were nonobese and receiving metformin, and Group 4 were nonobese receiving OCPs. ADMA, homocysteine, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and homeostasis model assessment estimate of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were investigated. ADMA, homocysteine, hs-CRP and HOMA-IR were similar in obese and nonobese groups before the treatment. After 6 months of treatment, a significant decrease was observed in ADMA, homocysteine and HOMA-IR levels in Groups 1 and 3. An increase in ADMA and hs-CRP levels was observed in Groups 2 and 4. In this study, metformin treatment leads to improvement in hormonal and metabolic parameters and decreases ADMA and homocysteine levels possibly independent of BMI. However, the use of oral contraceptives in obese and nonobese patients with PCOS with impaired glucose tolerance increases ADMA and hs-CRP levels and creates an increase in the metabolic risk. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Purpose.This study is designed to compare the results of invitro fertilisation (IVF) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and tubal factor disorders. Materials and methods.This was a cohort study performed in Royan Institute from 2007 to 2009. For this evaluation, 183 patients with PCOS and 183 patients with tubal factor (control group), whose ages ranged from 22 to 35 years underwent the long protocol of pituitary suppression and were included in the study. Results.In a defined time cycle, the number of ampoules used was higher for the control group (24.6+/-0.9 versus 33.4+/-0.9; p<0.0001). The PCOS group produced more oocytes (9.6+/-0.5 versus 6.4+/-0.3; p <=0.0001) and embryos (3.7+/-0.2 versus 2.7+/-0.1; p=0.001). There were no significant differences in cancellation rate, the occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and cycles that resulted in lacked efficient follicle in the PCOS group and control group. Comparisons for biochemical pregnancy, implantation, clinical pregnancy and ongoing pregnancy rates showed no statistical difference. No significant differences were detected in miscarriage rates and complications. Conclusion.The outcome of IVF in patients with PCOS and in patients with tubal infertility is similar. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To compare the effect of two different insulin sensitizers, metformin and pioglitazone, on endothelial function in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Prospective randomized study. Setting(s): University Hospital endocrinology outpatient clinic. Patient(s): Young women with PCOS (aged 23.3 +/- 4.9 years). Intervention(s): Patients were assigned randomly to no treatment (n = 14), metformin 850 mg two times per day (n = 15), and pioglitazone 30 mg daily (n = 14) for 6 months. Healthy age- and body mass index-matched women served as controls (n = 14). Main Outcome Measure(s): Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation was studied at baseline and 6 months. Result(s): Women with PCOS had higher insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism indices and lower flow-mediated dilation compared with controls. The three groups of women with PCOS did not differ at baseline. No differences were observed at follow-up in women who received no treatment. Metformin and pioglitazone improved flow-mediated dilation to a similar extent, restoring it to normal values at 6 months. Both insulin sensitizers induced favorable changes in insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism indices in women with PCOS. Independent predictors of flow-mediated dilation improvement at 6 months were treatment with insulin sensitizers and reduction in insulin resistance. Conclusion(s): In young women with PCOS, treatment with metformin or pioglitazone for 6 months induces a similar beneficial effect on endothelial function; this may be partially attributed to an improvement in insulin resistance. Further research is needed to investigate whether treatment with insulin sensitizers in women with PCOS also reduces cardiovascular risk. © 2011 American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: This study was designed to evaluate the hypothesis that low-level fluences done repetitively on a hair follicle will produce permanent hair removal with less discomfort and fewer side effects than a single high-fluence pulse. Objective(s): To compare the safety and efficacy of a low-fluence, high-repetition rate versus a high-fluence, low-repetition rate 810-nm diode laser for permanent hair reduction in patients with facial hirsutism. Method(s): Forty-two female patients with confirmed polycystic ovaries by ultrasonography with facial hirsutism were subjected to the low-fluence, high-repetition Soprano XL laser in SHR mode and the LightSheerTM laser on each side of the face using preset parameters once a month for six sessions. Hair counts were done at the end of the sixth session using a 'Hi Quality Hair Analysis Program System' and the pain score was recorded by a visual analog scale. Result(s): The overall median reduction of hair was 90.5% with the Soprano XL and 85% with the LightSheer, with a standard deviation of 7 and 8.5 respectively. Discussion(s): This new technology, with low fluence and high repetition, showed a statistically insignificant increase in hair reduction compared to the LightSheer, but did show a significant reduction in hair thickness and a low pain score. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To estimate whether women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) will display ambient hyperglycemia (as measured by continuous glucose monitoring) early in pregnancy that progressively exacerbates with advancing pregnancy. Method(s): This was a case-control study during singleton pregnancies of 17 women with PCOS and 17 healthy women. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) followed by 24-hour continuous glucose monitoring was obtained four times throughout the pregnancy (visit 1: 6-10 weeks; visit 2: 12-16 weeks; visit 3: 24-28 weeks; visit 4: 34-38 weeks). Result(s): Eight women with PCOS (47%) and two women in the control group (12%) developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) as defined by World Health Organization criteria. Women with PCOS had a higher area under the curve for glucose during the OGTT at visit 1, visit 2, and visit 3, and for insulin at visit 1, compared with the control group. No differences were found between groups for any of the continuous glucose monitoring parameters studied. The free androgen index significantly decreased over the course of the study in both groups with a stronger decrease in the PCOS group at visit 1 (P=.003), visit 2 (P=.07), and visit 3 (P=.04). The difference in birth weight between groups was not significant: 3,346 g in women with PCOS and 3,633 g in women in the control group, and there was no perinatal morbidity. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS are at increased risk for GDM, which manifests early in pregnancy and is detectable by OGTT. Serial 24-hour glucose monitoring did not reveal changes in glucose metabolism, although our sample size was small. Hyperandrogenemia improves with progressive pregnancy in women with PCOS. © 2011 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Objective: To determine if the combination of lifestyle (caloric restriction and exercise) and metformin (MET) would be superior to lifestyle and placebo (PBO) in improving the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotype. Design(s): Double-blind randomized 6-month trial of MET versus PBO. Setting(s): Two academic medical centers. Patient(s): One hundred fourteen subjects with PCOS were randomized to MET (N = 55) or PBO (N = 59). Intervention(s): Subjects collected urine daily for ovulation monitoring, had monthly monitoring of hormones and weight and determination of body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, glucose tolerance, and were evaluated for quality of life at baseline and completion. Main Outcome Measure(s): Ovulation rates and testosterone levels. Result(s): Dropout rates were high. There was no significant difference in ovulation rates. Testosterone levels were significantly lower compared with baseline in the MET group at 3 mos but not at 6 mos. There were no differences in weight loss between groups, but MET showed a significant decline at 6 months compared with baseline (-3.4 kg, 95% confidence interval -5.3 to -1.5 kg). We noted divergent effects of MET versus PBO on oral glucose tolerance test indices of insulin sensitivity (increased) and secretion (worsened). Total bone mineral density increased significantly in MET. There were no differences in quality of life measures between the groups. The MET group had increased diarrhea and headache, but fewer bladder infections and musculoskeletal complaints. Conclusion(s): The addition of metformin to lifestyle therapy produced little reproductive or glycemic benefit in women with PCOS, although our study had limited power owing to a high dropout rate. It is not possible at baseline to identify women likely to drop out. ©2011 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Objective.?To assess the impact of metformin and of two different oral contraceptives (OCs) containing cyproterone acetate and drospirenone, on serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels, in a cohort of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with hyperandrogenism. Design.?Prospective randomised study. Setting. Division of Endocrinology and Human Reproduction, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Patients.?Forty-five (45) women with PCOS diagnosed according to the criteria proposed in 1990 by the NIH. Interventions.?Women with PCOS were randomised into three groups, all treated for 6 months: Group A received an OC containing 35 mu g ethinylestradiol plus 2 mg cyproterone acetate, Group B received an OC containing 30 mu g ethinylestradiol plus 3 mg drospirenone and Group C received metformin 850 mg x 2. Main outcome measure(s).?Anti-Mullerian hormone levels were measured by a specific ELISA. Results.?AMH was significantly decreased under treatment with 35 mu g ethinylestradiol plus 2 mg cyproterone acetate (p = 0.002 at 3 months and p < 0.001 at 6 months). Treatment with 30 mu g ethinylestradiol plus 3 mg drospirenone, and treatment with metformin 850 mg x 2 did not significantly affect serum AMH levels. AMH was significantly decreased under OCs treatment compared to metformin 850 mg x 2 (p = 0.005). Conclusion(s).?AMH serum levels were significantly decreased under treatment with 35 mu g ethinylestradiol plus 2 mg cyproterone acetate, due to decrease in androgens and suppression of gonadotropins. © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the metabolic and endocrine effects of treatment with cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) plus metformin compared with metformin alone in women with PCOS. Method(s): In this prospective randomized study of women with PCOS, 20 women received 850 mg of metformin twice a day, and 20 women received 850 mg of metformin plus 5 mg of MPA twice a day. Body mass index, hormonal and lipid blood profiles, homocysteine blood level, and insulin sensitivities assessed by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) were recorded at baseline and at 3 months. Result(s): Total cholesterol levels decreased in the metformin plus MPA group (P = 0.002) but did not change significantly in the metformin group (P = 0.159). While homocysteine levels remained unchanged in the metformin plus MPA group, they increased significantly in the metformin group (P = 0.002). Conclusion(s): There were no adverse effects of short-term cyclic MPA plus metformin treatment on metabolic parameters or insulin resistance in patients with PCOS over a 3-month treatment period. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that the risk of adverse obstetric or neonatal outcomes varies according to different phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and to evaluate the clinical impact of the main features of PCOS. Design(s): Prospective controlled clinical study. Setting(s): Academic Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and of Endocrinology, Italy. Patient(s): Ninety-seven pregnant women with PCOS and 73 healthy pregnant subjects were recruited as cases and controls, respectively. Intervention(s): Clinical, biochemical, and ultrasonographic evaluations. Main Outcome Measure(s): Obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Result(s): The relative risk (RR) for adverse obstetric or neonatal outcomes was increased (1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.96) in patients with PCOS and varied according to the PCOS phenotype (1.93, 95% CI 1.12-2.96; 2.23, 95% CI 1.21-3.15; 0.54, 95% CI 0.09-1.63, and 0.48, 95% CI 0.31-0.78 for full-blown, nonpolycystic ovaries [PCO], nonhyperandrogenic, and ovulatory phenotypes, respectively). The RRs were 1.57 (95% CI 0.85-2.52) and 0.48 (95% CI 0.31-0.78) for oligoanovulatory and ovulatory patients with PCOS, respectively. The risk for adverse obstetric or neonatal outcomes was affected significantly by ovarian dysfunction and biochemical hyperandrogenism, whereas no significant effect was detected for clinical hyperandrogenism and PCO. Conclusion(s): The increased risk for adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes that was observed in patients with PCOS varies widely according to the different phenotypes and features of PCOS.

N2  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of metformin in addition to diet and exercise on endocrine and metabolic disturbances in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo (PBO) control trial. Thirty women with insulin resistance and PCOS received lifestyle modification and 1500 mg of metformin or placebo for 4 months. Before and after treatment, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, blood pressure, hirsutism, and menstrual patterns were evaluated. Serum concentrations of gonadotropins, androgens, progesterone, glucose, insulin, and lipids were measured. Lifestyle interventions resulted in similar weight and menstrual cycle's improvements in both groups. A significant reduction in serum fasting insulin, HOMA index, waist and testosterone levels was only observed with metformin. There were no significant changes in androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, gonadotropins, and lipids levels. No other changes were observed in hirsutism or blood pressure. These findings suggest that metformin has an additive effect to diet and exercise to improve parameters of hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. Although, a small decrease in body weight trough lifestyle changes could be enough to improve menstrual cycles in insulin-resistant women with PCOS. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To investigate metformin effects on the endocrine-metabolic parameters and ovarian morphology in normoinsulinemic women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Randomized double-blind study. Setting(s): Operative Division of Endocrinological Gynecology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. Patient(s): Twenty-eight normal-weight normoinsulinemic PCOS women. Intervention(s): Patients were randomized to receive metformin 500 mg twice a day (group A, 15 subjects) or placebo (group B, 13 subjects) for 6 months. Ultrasonographic pelvic exams, hormonal and lipid features, and oral glucose tolerance test were performed at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Main Outcome Measure(s): Hormonal and glycoinsulinemic assessment, ovarian ultrasound appearance. Result(s): Glycoinsulinemic assessment remained unvaried in both groups. About 70% of patients in group A experienced a restoration of menstrual cyclicity. Metformin significantly decreased testosterone levels at 3 and 6 months) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels at 6 months, and improved hirsutism score at 6 months. No clinical or hormonal modifications occurred in group B. Metformin, but not placebo, reduced ovarian volume and stromal/total area ratio at 3 and 6 months. Conclusion(s): Metformin seems to improve the menstrual pattern and ultrasonographic ovarian features in normoinsulinemic PCOS women. These effects seem to be, at least in part, independent of the insulin-lowering properties of the drug. © 2010 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Background: A prospective randomized trial was conducted to compare efficacy of a drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives (COC) with desogestrel-containing COC in women with polycystic ovary-syndrome (PCOS) not desirous of child-bearing. Study Design: Sixty women were randomized into study group [ethinylestradiol (EE) 30 mcg+drospirenone 3 mg] and control group (EE 30 mcg+desogestrel 150 mcg), treated for 6 months and followed up at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, during treatment and 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Acne and hirsutism scoring, bodyweight, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), ultrasound parameters, lipid profile, glycemic profile and hormonal profile were compared. Result(s): Cycles were regular in both groups during treatment. Effect of regular cycles persisted in 44.83% (13/30) vs. 17.24% (5/30) in study vs. control group at 6 months post-treatment with 33.3% decreased hirsutism score in the study group (versus no change in control group) even at 6 months after stopping treatment. With treatment, BMI fell by 0.52 kg/m2 in the study group; systolic and diastolic BP fell in the study group while it rose in the control group. Low-density lipoprotein significantly decreased and high-density lipoprotein was elevated in the study group (p<.05). The study group showed a significant fall in fasting/postprandial blood sugar and insulin and total testosterone against a rise in the control group. Conclusion(s): In women with PCOS, a drospirenone containing COC has better outcome in terms of persistent regular cycles, antiandrogenic effect, fall in BMI and BP, better lipid profile, favorable glycemic and hormonal profile than desogestrel- containing COC. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - AIMS: To investigate metabolic characteristics and perinatal outcomes of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHOD(S): We evaluated 34 GDM in women with PCOS and 70 GDM in women without PCOS in this prospective study. All GDM women were treated with medical nutrition therapy (MNT). Pre-pregnancy clinical data, fasting glucose, fasting insulin (FINS), blood lipid, homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and perinatal outcomes were investigated. RESULT(S): GDM in women with PCOS had higher pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), higher incidence of overweight than in the non-PCOS group (each P<0.001). Incidence of history of infertility was also significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the non-PCOS group (20.6% vs. 2.9%, P<0.01). A higher incidence of early pregnancy loss (EPL) was found in the PCOS group than in the non-PCOS group (20.6% vs. 7.1%, P<0.05). Significantly higher in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) rate and insulin administration was also observed in the PCOS group than in the controls. No significant difference was found in the prevalence of preeclampsia, premature delivery, macrosomia, fetal death and neonatal congenital anomaly between GDM in women with and without PCOS (all P>0.05). [corrected] CONCLUSION(S): Compared with the controls, no significant increase in the incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes was detected in GDM in women with PCOS by appropriate management.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of oral contraceptive on the serum free prostatic specific antigen (PSA) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOD) compared with cyproterone compound. Material(s) and Method(s): In this randomized clinical trial, 60 hirsute PCOD patients that referred to Imam Hossein hospital were enrolled. Baseline Ferriman-Gallway score (FG), body mass index (BMI), free PSA, 17-hydroxy progesterone (17-OHP), free testosterone, and dehydroepiandre-standione sulfate (DHEAS) were measured. Then patients were divided randomly into two groups. One group received oral contraceptive pill (OCP) and the other one ate cyproterone compound (Diane). Hormonal profile and Ferriman-Gallway scores were evaluated again after 3 months. Result(s): Baseline FG score was 10.78 +/- 2.4 vs. 11.5 +/- 2.3 in OCP and cyproterone compound group, respectively. FG score was reduced after 3 months to 8.06 +/- 2.5 vs. 9.2 +/- 2.3, respectively (P value = 0.000). There was no significant difference in FG score reduction after the treatment between two groups (r > 0.05). Baseline PSA was 0.201 +/- 0.3 in OCP group and 0.097 +/- 0.12 ng/ml in cyproterone compound group and after the treatment was decreased in both groups significantly 0.135 +/- 0.24 vs. 0.059 +/- 0.05 ng/ml, respectively, but the mean reduction of score was the same for both groups (r > 0.5). Free testosterone reduced more in OCP group (2.48 +/- 1.3 ng/ ml to 2.24 +/- 1.0 ng/ml, P value=0.03) than cyproterone compound (2.00 +/- 1.2 to 1.64 +/- 0.9 ng/ ml, P value= 0.1). There was no statistical differences observed in 17-OHP and DHEAS after the treatment in both groups (P value >0.5). Conclusion(s): Serum free PSA and free testosterone and FG score were decreased after treatment with OCP and cyproterone compound but there was no preference between the two groups of anti-androgen treatment. © 2010 Middle East Fertility Society.

N2  - Objective To study the impedance to blood flow through the uterine artery in pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and to evaluate its predictive value for adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes in this population. Design Prospective case-control study. Setting Academic Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Italy. Population Seventy-three pregnant women with ovulatory PCOS (PCOS group) and 73 age- and body mass index-matched healthy pregnant controls (control group). Methods Serial Doppler velocimetry measurements of the uterine artery. Main outcome measures Blood flow impedance indices and pregnancy/perinatal outcomes. Results A significantly (P < 0.05) higher rate of subjects with abnormal velocimetry findings was observed in the PCOS group than in the control group. In the PCOS group, the pulsatility index (PI) at first (P = 0.042) and mid-second (P = 0.039) trimesters of pregnancy, and bilateral notch at first (P = 0.025) and mid-second (P = 0.007) trimesters of pregnancy, were the strongest independent predictors of adverse outcomes. Conversely, in the control group, PI at the first trimester of pregnancy was a predictor of adverse outcomes only when combined with bilateral notch (P = 0.042), whereas at mid-second trimester of pregnancy PI (P = 0.033) and bilateral notch (P = 0.048) were independent predictors of adverse outcomes. Conclusions Uterine artery Doppler indices are more commonly altered in pregnant patients with PCOS than in controls, showing a high predictive value for abnormal pregnancy/perinatal outcomes. © RCOG 2010 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

N2  - Objective: To determine the effects of different treatment regimens on the hormonal features, metabolic parameters, and hematologic variables in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): Forty-eight women with PCOS were randomized into four treatment protocols: ethinyl estradiol/cyproterone acetate (EE/CA; n = 12), EE/CA-metformin (n = 12), metformin alone (n = 12) and EE/CA-spironolactone (n = 12). These treatment protocols were given for 3 months and pre- and post-treatment variables were compared. Result(s): Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) levels, D-dimer, HOMA-IR, insulin, WBC, MPV as well as androgen levels decreased in all treatment groups. EE/CA-metformin and metformin alone groups resulted in a higher proportional reduction of D-dimer levels than the other protocols, while no significant different proportional reduction was observed in all the four groups for MPV, WBC, APTT, PT values. EE/CA-metformin group showed higher proportional reduction fasting insulin concentrations, HOMA-IR and free testosterone levels than metformin alone and EE/CA-spironolactone groups. DHEAs levels significantly decreased in group EE/CA-metformin than EE/CA alone and EE/CA-spironolactone groups. In multiple stepwise regression analyses, reduction in proportional insulin levels was independently and positively associated with decrease of MPV, D-dimer, free testosterone levels. Conclusion(s): In all treatment groups, we observed reduced levels of coagulation parameters, improvement of hormonal, hematological and metabolical variables by most probably reducing insulin levels. Among the treatment groups, EE/CA-metformin may be a more effective therapeutic option than the other protocols and this may be due to the beneficial effect of EE/CA-metformin on insulin resistance. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Background: Given the high rate of pregnancy and perinatal complications recently observed in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the lack of data on the serum variations in androgens and insulin sensitivity indexes in pregnant women with PCOS, the current study was aimed to assess these changes and their potential effect on pregnancy outcomes in a population of women with PCOS. Method(s): Forty-five pregnant patients with ovulatory PCOS (PCOS group) and other 42 healthy pregnant women (control group) were studied assaying serum androgen levels and insulin sensitivity indexes throughout pregnancy serially, and recording obstetrical outcomes. Result(s): Serum androgen levels and insulin resistance indexes were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in PCOS than in control group at study entry, these differences were sustained throughout pregnancy, and their changes resulted significantly (p < 0.05) different between PCOS and control group. In PCOS patients, women who had a complicated pregnancy showed serum androgen levels and insulin sensitivity indexes significantly (p < 0.05) worse in comparison to subjects without any pregnancy and/or neonatal complications. Conclusion(s): PCOS patients have impaired changes in serum androgen levels and insulin sensitivity indexes during pregnancy. These alterations could be implicated in the pregnancy and neonatal complications frequently observed in women affected by PCOS. © 2010 Falbo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of metformin in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). As follow-up on a previous paper describing hormonal and metabolic factors, this paper focuses on correlations between adiponectin and anthropometric, hormonal, and metabolic factors in PCOS and the effect of metformin. Design(s): Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Setting(s): District and university hospital. Patient(s): Fifty-two women with PCOS. Three groups were defined according to baseline adiponectin. Intervention(s): Metformin or placebo for 6 months, followed by 3 months' washout before switching to opposite treatment. Blood tests and measurements were performed before and after treatment periods. Main Outcome Measure(s): Adiponectin, insulin, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, and testosterone. Result(s): Waist-hip ratio (WHR), insulin, and HOMA index were significantly higher in the lower adiponectin group than in the upper and middle group, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was higher in the upper than in the lower adiponectin group. Multiple regression analysis with adiponectin as the dependent variable and HOMA index, HDL cholesterol, testosterone, and WHR as independent variables showed an R2 of 0.43 with beta-coefficients of -0.12 for the HOMA index, 0.72 for HDL cholesterol, and -1.49 for WHR. Testosterone did not contribute to the prediction of adiponectin levels. Metformin had no effect on adiponectin in spite of significant decreases in weight, fasting glucose, and insulin resistance. Conclusion(s): In PCOS, adiponectin levels are closely linked to insulin resistance, HDL cholesterol, and abdominal adiposity and unaffected by metformin.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Objective.The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of myo-inositol (MYO) and metformin, in monotherapy or in association with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (r-FSH), in the treatment of menstrual irregularities, chronic anovulation, and female infertility in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Materials and methods.One hundred twenty patients were randomly treated with metformin 1500 mg/day orally (n60), or 4 g MYO plus 400 mug folic acid daily (n60), continuously. If no pregnancy occurred, r-FSH (37.5 units/day) was added to the treatment for a maximum of three attempts. Results.Fifty percent of the patients who assumed metformin restored spontaneous ovulation, 18.3 of these obtained pregnancy. The remaining 42 patients were treated with metformin plus r-FSH. Pregnancy occurred in a total of 11 women (26.1). The total pregnancy rate was 36.6. Sixty-five percent of the patients treated with MYO plus folic acid restored spontaneous ovulation activity, 30 of these obtained pregnancy. The remaining 38 patients were treated with MYO, folic acid plus r-FSH. Pregnancy occurred in a total of 11 women (28.9). The total pregnancy rate was 48.4. Conclusions.Both metformin and MYO, can be considered as first line treatment for restoring normal menstrual cycles in most patients with PCOS, even if MYO treatment seems to be more effective than metformin. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study was comparison of the effects of Metformin and Cyproterone-estradiol compound on serum androgens & highly sensitive C-reactive protein levels. Methodology: Sixty patients with Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) were enrolled in this study conducted during a period of 16 months from December 2004 to March 2006. Thirty subjects were in each group and treated with Metformin one gram per day or Cyproterone-estradiol compound 21 days monthly and at the beginning and after 3 and 6 months, weight, height, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and hs-CRP levels were measured. Result(s): Mean age of patients was 23.5+/-8.7 years with the range of 15 to 49 years. In both groups significant decreases in DHEA-S levels and in Cyproterone-estradiol compound group a significant decrease in testosterone levels were seen after 6 months, but there were no significant decrease on hs- CRP levels. Comparison of two groups showed that there were no significant differences in the effects of these two drugs on serum testosterone, DHEA-S and hs-CRP levels. In our study the level of hs- CRP at the beginning of treatment were significantly higher in patients who were overweight and obese. Also we found that Cyproterone-estradiol compound causes significant decrease at the level of hs-CRP in overweight and obese patients. Conclusion(s): The results of this study are different from those of previous studies about beneficial effects of Metformin on hs-CRP levels but are similar to the results of studies that revealed probably obesity and overweight has important role in inducing inflammation and increasing CRP levels.

N2  - Context: Metformin is widely prescribed to pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in an attempt to reduce pregnancy complications. Metformin is not approved for this indication, and evidence for this practice is lacking. Objective(s):Our objective was to test the hypothesis that metformin, from first trimester to delivery, reduces pregnancy complications in women with PCOS. Design and Setting: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study at 11 secondary care centers. Participant(s): The participants were 257 women with PCOS, in the first trimester of pregnancy, aged 18-42 yr. Intervention(s): We randomly assigned 274 singleton pregnancies (in 257 women) to receive metformin or placebo, from first trimester to delivery. Main Outcome Measure(s): The prevalence of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm delivery, and a composite of these three outcomes is reported. Result(s): Preeclampsia prevalence was 7.4% in the metformin group and 3.7% in the placebo group (3.7%; 95% CI, -1.7-9.2) (P = 0.18). Preterm delivery prevalence was 3.7% in the metformin group and 8.2% in the placebo group (-4.4%; 95%, CI, -10.1-1.2) (P = 0.12). Gestational diabetes mellitus prevalence was 17.6% in the metformin group and 16.9% in the placebo group (0.8%;95% CI, -8.6 -10.2) (P = 0.87). The composite primary endpoint prevalence was 25.9 and 24.4%, respectively (1.5%; 95% CI, -8.9-11.3) (P = 0.78). Women in the metformin group gained less weight during pregnancy compared with those in the placebo group. There was no difference in fetal birth weight between the groups. Conclusion(s): Metformin treatment from first trimester to delivery did not reduce pregnancy complications in PCOS. Copyright © 2010 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - Background: This randomized study's aim was to compare the effect of four oral contraceptives (OCs) containing 30 mcg of ethinylestradiol (EE) and different progestogens [drospirenone, (DRSP), chlormadinone acetate (CMA), desogestrel (DSG), gestodene (GSD)] on biochemical and hormonal parameters of hyperandrogenism and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Study Design: Forty women with PCOS (age 16-35 years) were recruited and randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups of 10 women each, treated, respectively, with 3 mg DRSP/30 mcg EE (Yasmin, Bayer Shering), 2 mg CMA/30 mcg EE (Belara, Grunenthal), 75 mcg GSD/30 mcg EE (Minulet, Wyeth Lederle) and 150 mcg DSG/30 mcg EE (Practil 21, Organon Italia). Blood samples were obtained on day 6-8 of the control cycle and day 6-8 of the third treatment cycle for assay of the following hormones: androsteredione (A), total testosterone (T), free T, SHBG, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS). Result(s): In all groups, mean concentrations of free T, total T and A dropped by 40-60%, and concentrations of DHEAS dropped by 20-50%. Formulations with DRSP and CMA caused a greater reduction of androgens and a progressive increase in serum concentrations of SHBG than those with DSG and GSD. Conclusion(s): Clinical studies need to be performed to determine effects of these OCs upon clinical signs of hyperandrogenism. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: To determine if EE/CA- and EE/CA plus metformin treatment have any effect on adhesion molecules in cases with PCOS. Method(s): Among 40 patients diagnosed with PCOS, one study arm was administered EE/CA (n=20, cyproterone acetate 2 mg, ethinylestradiol 35 mug) and the other was administered metformin (1,700 mg) combined with EE/CA (n=20, cyproterone acetate 2 mg, ethinylestradiol 35 mug). Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (sE-selectin), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble leukocyte endothelial cell adhesion molecule-3 (sP-selectin), lipid profile, androgens, insulin, and HOMA-IR values were assessed prior to treatment and after 3 months of therapy. Result(s): The comparison of the groups receiving EE/CA and EE/ CA+metformin revealed a significant reduction in sVCAM (1,445+/-614 vs 1,167+/-482, p<0.05) and sICAM (442+/-141 vs 345+/-118, p<0.05) values relative to pre-treatment values while no significant changes were detected in sE-selectin and sP-selectin levels relative to pre-treatment levels in the EE/CA+metformin group (p>0.05). In the post-treatment period, sVCAM, sICAM, sE-selectin values did not significantly change compared to the pre-treatment values in EE/CA group (p>0.05). sP-selectin levels were also decreased but missed the significance in EE/CA group (229.4+/-68.0 vs 189.6+/-65.0, p=0.08). Conclusion(s): These results demonstrate that EE/CA+metformin treatment reduced inflammation markers in cases with PCOS compared to EE/CA treatment. The clinical relevance of this conclusion may be clarified by longer metformin treatment and clinical follow-up. © 2009 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.

N2  - Aim: The aim of the present study was to assess whether continuation of metformin therapy throughout pregnancy can reduce the development of gestational diabetes in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): This experimental study was conducted in a private tertiary level infertility care center between June 2002 and December 2006. Fifty-nine non-diabetic PCOS patients who conceived while taking metformin and different ovulation-inducing agents comprised the sample group. Twenty-nine of them continued metformin throughout pregnancy and 30 did not. The main outcome measure was development of gestational diabetes in women with PCOS and their fetal outcome. Result(s): Basic parameters such as age, body mass index, levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, free testosterone, dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate, fasting sugar and fasting insulin did not differ between the two groups. Among 29 women who received metformin, gestational diabetes developed during one of 29 pregnancies (3.44%) versus nine of 30 pregnancies (30%) without metformin. The odds ratio for gestational diabetes in women without metformin versus with metformin was 12 (95% confidence interval: 6.20-18.08). All babies born in the metformin group had average birthweight and those in the control group 4 (13.33%) were large for date. Conclusion(s): In PCOS use of metformin throughout pregnancy is associated with and might be responsible for a ninefold reduction (30-3.44%) of gestational diabetes. © 2008 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by anovulation, infertility, and hyperandrogenism. The present study aims to compare the clinical, biochemical, and hormonal changes in PCOS patients taking estradiol-cyproterone acetate (ECA), metformin (MET), and rosiglitazone (ROSI). METHOD(S): Ninety-four patients with PCOS were randomized according to the therapy they received as follows: MET 2 g/d group (n = 47), ROSI 4 mg/d group (n = 14), and 35 mug ethinyl estradiol-2 mg cyproterone acetate group (ECA) (n = 33). Complete hormonal assays, lipid profile, glucose, and insulin levels were studied over a 4-months period. RESULT(S): Patients randomized to the MET group lost more weight and had a greater reduction in BMI compared with baseline (P = 0.006 and P = 0.004). The reduction in triglyceride levels and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were statistically significant in the MET group while no changes were observed in the other groups. Regarding HDL levels, did not change in MET and ECA groups, but there was a significant increase compared with baseline in the ROSI group (P = 0.04). Mann-Whitney U test showed that the change (a tendency of reduction) was more significant in PCOS patients on MET for both total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (P < 0.001). The rate of improvement in oligomenorrhea was similar in all 3 treatments (P = 0.202). CONCLUSION(S): Our data show that in women with PCOS, ECA is more effective than insulin-sensitizing drugs such as rosiglitazone and metformin in improving menstrual pattern and reducing serum free-testosterone levels. MET, an insulin-sensitizing drug, is more effective in reducing fasting insulin levels than the ECA. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - Context: Mean insulin resistance (IR) is greater and it is also more variable in overweight women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) compared to weight matched controls. Whilst treatment will reduce the mean IR, it is not known if the IR variability is also reduced. Objective(s): To compare the change in IR and its variability before and after treatment with insulin sensitization through metformin and pioglitazone, compared to that induced by weight loss with orlistat. Design(s): Randomized, open labelled parallel study. Setting(s): Endocrinology outpatient clinic at a referral centre. Patient(s): Thirty obese PCOS patients [BMI 36.0 +/- 1.2 kg/m2 (mean +/- SEM)] participated in the study. Intervention(s): The change in biological variability (BV) was assessed by measuring IR (homeostasis model assessment method) at 4-day intervals on 10 consecutive occasions before and 12 weeks after randomization to metformin, pioglitazone or orlistat. Outcome measured: The primary end point of the study was a change in BV of IR. Result(s): Treatment with pioglitazone, orlistat and metformin reduced the overall IR by 41.0 +/- 4.1%, 19.7 +/- 6.4% and 16.1 +/- 6.8% (P = 0.005, P = 0.013, P = 0.17, respectively) and IR variability by 28.5 +/- 18.0%, 41.8 +/- 11.6% and 23.7 +/- 17.0 (P = 0.20, P = 0.015 and P = 0.28, respectively). Free androgen index reduced significantly with all treatments. Conclusion(s): Only orlistat reduced both IR and its variability significantly, though all three drugs were effective in reducing hyperandrogenism within the 12-week period of the study. © 2009 The Authors.

N2  - Objective: To assess metabolic parameters in the cord blood of newborns of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to correlate these parameters with those of mothers with PCOS during midgestation. Design(s): Case-control study. Setting(s): Unit of Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine. Patient(s): Thirty newborns of mothers with PCOS (PCOSn) and 34 newborns of control mothers (Cn) were studied. Intervention(s): A sample of cord blood was obtained at delivery. In all mothers, an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) with measurement of glucose and insulin was performed at 22-28 weeks of gestation. In cord blood and in the fasting sample of the oGTT, serum leptin, adiponectin, insulin, glucose, and lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) were determined. Result(s): PCOSn showed significantly higher leptin concentrations than Cn. Moreover, in PCOSn, leptin concentrations in cord blood were correlated with birth weight (r = 0.495) and body mass index of the mother at midpregnancy (r = 0.644). Conclusion(s): The metabolic parameters in the cord blood of PCOSn are similar to those observed in controls, except for leptin concentrations, which are significantly higher. The latter could be related to the fetal adiposity or the metabolic condition of the mother. © 2009 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Objective: To compare the effects of metformin versus an antiandrogenic contraceptive pill on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Clinical randomized trial. Setting(s): Academic hospital. Patient(s): Thirty-four consecutive PCOS patients. Intervention(s): PCOS patients randomized to oral treatment with metformin (n = 19) or with Diane35 Diario pill (n = 15) for 24 weeks. Main Outcome Measure(s): ABPM recordings and ultrasound measurements of CIMT as marker of subclinical atherosclerosis obtained at baseline and after treatment. Result(s): Metformin resulted in reductions in daytime and 24-hour average systolic and diastolic blood pressure whereas Diane35 Diario induced a slight increase in these parameters. Compared with a nonhyperandrogenic control group, the increased CIMT values of PCOS patients decreased to the normal range after treatment with either metformin or Diane35 Diario. Conclusion(s): Metformin treatment decreased daytime ABPM recordings whereas Diane35 Diario exerted the opposite effect. The safer blood pressure profile of metformin should be considered in PCOS patients who present with a history of hypertension or who are at risk for this disorder. Treatment with either Diane35 Diario or metformin improved CIMT mean values. © 2009 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - To investigate the effects of treatment with Myo-inositol (an insulin sensitizing drug), on circulating insulin, glucose tolerance, ovulation and serum androgens concentrations in women with the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Forty-two women with PCOS were treated in a double-blind trial with Myo-inositol plus folic acid or folic acid alone as placebo. In the group treated with Myo-inositol the serum total testosterone decreased from 99.5+/-7 to 34.8+/-4.3 ng/dl (placebo group: from 116.8+/-15 to 109+/-7.5 ng/dl; P=0.003), and serum free testosterone from 0.85+/-0.1 to 0.24+/-0.33 ng /dl (placebo group: from 0.89+/-0.12 to 0.85+/-0.13 ng/di; P=0.01). Plasma triglycerides decreased from 195+/-20 to 95+/-17 mg/dl (placebo group: from 166+/-21 to 148+/-19 mg/dl; P=0.001). Systolic blood pressure decreased from 131+/-2 to 127+/-2 mmHg (placebo group: from 128+/-1 to 130+/-1 mmHg; P=0.002). Diastolic blood pressure decreased from 88+/-1 to 82+/-3 mmHg (placebo group: from 86+/-1 to 90+/-1 mmHg; P=0.001). The area under the plasma insulin curve after oral administration of glucose decreased from 8.54+/-1.149 to 5.535+/-.792 muU/ml/min (placebo group: from 8.903+/-1.276 to 9.1+/-1.162 muU/ml/min; P=0.03). The index of composite whole body insulin sensitivity (ISIcomp) increased from 2.80+/-0.35 to 5.05+/-0.59 mg-2/dl-2 (placebo group: from 3.23+/-0.48 to 2.81+/-0.54 mg-2/dl-2; P<0.002). 16 out of 23 women of Myo-inositol group ovulated (4 out of 19 in placebo group). Treatment of PCOS patients with Myo-inositol provided a decreasing of circulating insulin and serum total testosterone as well as an improvement in metabolic factors.

N2  - Objective: To determine the effects of myo-inositol on oocyte quality in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. Design(s): A prospective, controlled, randomized trial. Setting(s): Assisted reproduction centers. Patient(s): Sixty infertile PCO patients undergoing ovulation induction for ICSI. Intervention(s): All participants underwent standard long protocol. Starting on the day of GnRH administration, 30 participants received myo-inositol combined with folic acid (Inofolic) 2 g twice a day and 30 control women received folic acid alone, administrated continuously. Main Outcome Measure(s): Primary end points were number of morphologically mature oocytes retrieved, embryo quality, and pregnancy and implantation rates. Secondary end points were total number of days of FSH stimulation, total dose of gonadotropin administered, E2 level on the day of hCG administration, fertilization rate per number of retrieved oocytes, embryo cleavage rate, live birth and miscarriage rates, cancellation rate, and incidence of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Result(s): Total r-FSH units (1,958 +/- 695 vs. 2,383 +/- 578) and number of days of stimulation (11.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 12.4 +/- 1.4) were significantly reduced in the myo-inositol group. Furthermore, peak E2 levels (2,232 +/- 510 vs. 2,713 +/- 595 pg/mL) at hCG administration were significantly lower in patients receiving myo-inositol. The mean number of oocytes retrieved did not differ in the two groups, whereas in the group cotreated with myo-inositol the mean number of germinal vesicles and degenerated oocytes was significantly reduced (1.0 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.6 +/- 1.0), with a trend for increased percentage of oocytes in metaphase II (0.82 +/- 0.11% vs. 0.75 +/- 0.15%). Conclusion(s): These data show that in patients with PCOS, treatment with myo-inositol and folic acid, but not folic acid alone, reduces germinal vesicles and degenerated oocytes at ovum pick-up without compromising total number of retrieved oocytes. This approach, reducing E2 levels at hGC administration, could be adopted to decrease the risk of hyperstimulation in such patients. © 2009 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Objectives: To examine the effect of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a marker of the metabolic syndrome, on selected indicators of in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment success. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study was conducted using existing data on 69 IVF/ICSI treatment cycles undergone by PCOS women and a caliper-matched sample of 69 IVF/ICSI treatment cycles undergone by non-PCOS women over a 7-year period at a major fertility treatment center. Matching criteria were age and date at IVF/ICSI treatment initiation. Process and outcome measures were used to define successful IVF/ICSI treatment. Statistical significance was determined at an alpha level of 0.05. Result(s): The total number of oocytes and the number of immature oocytes retrieved in the process of an IVF/ICSI cycle were significantly higher in the context of PCOS. No significant differences were observed among PCOS and non-PCOS groups on various IVF/ICSI cycle outcomes, including high-grade embryo, pregnancy achievement, miscarriage, and live birth status. Conclusion(s): Although IVF/ICSI yields more oocytes in the context of PCOS, IVF/ICSI outcomes do not differ significantly by PCOS status. Prospective cohort studies are needed to examine short-term and long-term health effects of PCOS in the context of IVF/ICSI. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - To determine the effects of EE/CA (Ethinylestradiol/ Cyproterone Acetate) and EE/CA-metformin treatments on the asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels in women with PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome). Among 43 patients diagnosed with PCOS, one study arm (n=22) was administered (35 mug EE, 2mg CA) and the other (n=21) was administered (35 mug EE, 2mg CA plus 1700mg metformin). Serum ADMA, lipid profile, androgens, insulin, and HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance ) values were assessed prior to treatment and after 3 months of therapy. A significant reduction in ADMA levels relative to pre-treatment in the EE/CA+metformin group (1.2+/-0.4 vs 0.95+/-0.4, p=0.016) compared to the EE/CA group (1.0+/-0.5 vs 1.03+/-0.4, p >0.05). Andogens, insulin and HOMA-IR levels decreased in both treatment groups. All lipid profiles significantly improved in-group EE/CA+metformin while no significant decrease was observed in TG and HDL-cholesterol levels in EE/CA group. Post-treatment levels of HDL-C levels correlated significantly with the reducing ADMA levels in the EE/CA+metformin group (P=0.005, r= 0.602). Adding metformin to EE/CA therapy in PCOS may beneficial endothelium effects associated with reduction of ADMA levels. © 2009 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - The aim of the study is to compare the pregnancy outcome, especially the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus in a group of patients with PCOS, with a group of healthy weight matched women. Retrospectively we evaluated the pregnancies of 56 women with PCOS some of who had been treated for infertility. These were compared with a group of 56 age and weight matched controls. Incidence of Pregnancy induced hypertension in cases of PCOS was 14.2 % (8/56), gestational diabetes was 14.2 % (8/56) IHCP 10.7% (6/56) as compared of age and weight matched controls is with the incidence of PIH was 7.10% (4/56), GDM 3.5% (2/56) IHCP 7% (4/ 56).The differences in the incidence of GDM & PIH in two groups was not significant. The outcome of pregnancy in controls & the test groups were not significant, though numerically found to be heigher.Thereby, suggesting PCOS must be screened for comorbid conditions like PIH, GDM &IHCP.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an insulin-resistant state with hirsutism as a common manifestation. Objective(s): We hypothesized that treatment with metformin would improve the cosmetic effects of intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy for hair removal in PCOS patients. Method(s): In a prospective randomized controlled trial, 70 PCOS patients randomly received metformin (1,500 mg daily) + IPL therapy or IPL therapy alone for 5 IPL sessions during a 6-month period, followed by an additional 6 months of observation. Hirsutism score, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), free androgen index (FAI) and patient satisfaction were evaluated at every visit. Result(s): Fifty-two patients finished the study. Hirsutism was significantly better controlled in the metformin group (p = 0.009). Patient satisfaction was significantly better in the metformin group at the end of the observation period (52.9 vs. 34.1%, p = 0.019). HOMA-IR and FAI scores improved after metformin + IPL treatment (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Adding metformin to IPL in women with PCOS results in a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity and hirsutism. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous syndrome. In vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is required for PCOS cases that are refractory to standard ovulation induction or have co-existing infertility factors in women with PCOS and Tubal factor subfertility. Objective(s): Assess ethnic variations in response to IVF/ICSI treatment. Study design: Observational Comparative study in a University hospital fertility clinic in women with PCOS and Tubal factor subfertility. Women with PCOS (Asians: AP = 104; Caucasians: CP = 220) and those with tubal factor infertility seeking fertility treatment were assessed (Asians: AC = 84; Caucasians: CC = 200). Six hundred and eight fresh IVF or ICSI cycles using long protocol of GnRHa suppression and resulting in a fresh embryo transfer were compared. The primary endpoint was to assess the dose of gonadotropins used in the cycles. The secondary outcomes were: total number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization and ongoing clinical pregnancy rates. Result(s): We found that the South Asian women presented at a younger age for the management of sub-fertility. An extended stimulation phase and Caucasian ethnicity showed an inverse correlation with the number of oocytes retrieved in the PCOS subgroup. Caucasian ethnicity was associated with a higher fertilization rate however increase in body mass index (BMI) and the laboratory technique of IVF appeared to have a negative impact on fertilization rates in the PCOS subgroup. Commencing down regulation on day 1 of the cycles was negatively associated with fertilization rates in the tubal group. In terms of clinical pregnancy rates, the Caucasian PCOS had a 2.5 times (95% CI: 1.25-5) higher chance of an ongoing clinical pregnancy as compared with their Asian counterpart. Also, a unit increase in the basal FSH concentration reduced the odds of pregnancy by 18.6% (95% CI: 1.8-32.6%) in the PCOS group. Conclusion(s): The Asian PCOS have a greater sensitivity to gonadotropin stimulation with lower fertilization and ongoing clinical pregnancy rates as compared with their Caucasian counterparts. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background: We aimed to evaluate the serum adiponectin and lipid concentrations in normal and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women during pregnancy in order to establish whether PCOS induces abnormal lipid and adiponectin levels that could constitute potential metabolic risk factors for pregnancy complications. Method(s): Women with singleton pregnancies and of similar age were included (48 pregnant PCOS and 51 normal pregnant women). During gestational weeks 10-16 and 22-28, a 2 h, 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was performed, with measurement of glucose and insulin in each sample. Adiponectin and lipid concentrations were determined in the fasting sample. Result(s): The incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was significantly higher in the PCOS group (12.2%) compared with the control group (2%). In PCOS patients, triglyceride (TG) concentrations and area under the curve of glucose and insulin were higher in both study periods and adiponectin concentrations were significantly lower in the second period, compared with normal women. Moreover, adiponectin concentrations were lower in women with GDM than in those with normal glucose tolerance in the two study periods. Conclusion(s): Low adiponectin and high insulin levels are associated with GDM in pregnant PCOS patients. High TG levels seem not to be directly related to pregnancy complications in these patients. © The Author 2007.

N2  - Background: An association has been proposed between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders. Ambulatory blood pressure and carotid artery elasticity were therefore prospectively investigated in matched PCOS and control pregnancies. Method(s): Twenty two PCOS-control subject pairs with singleton pregnancies, matched for age, body mass index, parity and ethnicity, were recruited in the first trimester (T1, 11-13 weeks). Ambulatory blood pressure recording for 24 h and carotid artery ultrasound for elasticity estimation were performed in T1 and in the second (T2, 22-24 weeks) and third (T3, 32-34 weeks) trimesters. Result(s): At nearly all time points during gestation, ambulatory systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures were elevated in PCOS versus control pregnancies. Carotid artery stiffness index was greater and compliance was less in PCOS pregnancies compared with controls. Differences in night-time systolic pressure and carotid artery elasticity were greatest in T3. PCOS also increased the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension (6 of 22 cases versus 0 of 22 in controls; P = 0.011). Conclusion(s): Pregnant women with PCOS have higher baseline ambulatory blood pressure and impaired arterial elasticity, suggestive of disturbed vascular adaptation to pregnancy. © The Author 2007.

N2  - Objectives: To investigate the effects of treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 10 days per month for 6 months, on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): Sixty-three women with PCOS were randomized to receive MPA or ethinyl estradiol plus drospirenone. Result(s): There were no changes in lipid or carbohydrate metabolism in the MPA group, but serum levels of luteinizing hormone (P < 0.001) and total testosterone (P < 0.003) significantly decreased, as did the free androgen index (P < 0.02) and acne (P < 0.03) and seborrhea (P < 0.04) scores. In the ethinyl estradiol plus drospirenone group lipid and hormone values significantly increased whereas acne, seborrhea, hair loss, and Ferriman-Gallwey scores decreased. There was no statistically significant change in the total cholesterol to high-density cholesterol ratio in either group. Conclusion(s): Treatment of PCOS patients with MPA provided good menstrual cycle control, beneficial changes in hormonal values associated with hyperandrogenism, and no significant changes in lipid or carbohydrate metabolism. © 2008 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

N2  - Objective: The insulin-resistant state of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was found to be associated with a decreased glucose transporter GLUT4 expression in the insulin target tissues. This study was performed to explore whether the well-known clinical, hormonal and metabolic efficacy of metformin or rosiglitazone treatment is reflected in the modulation of adipocyte GLUT4 mRNA expression in patients with PCOS. Method(s): We enrolled 35 women with PCOS. They received either metformin or rosiglitazone for 6 months. A history, blood samples for the measurement of androgens and s.c. adipose tissue samples were taken at baseline and end point. Quantification of GLUT4 mRNA expression in adipose tissue was performed using real-time quantitative PCR. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMAIR) score calculation was applied as a measure for insulin resistance (IR). Result(s): GLUT4 mRNA expression in adipose tissue increased significantly in both groups (P <0.001). The increase was more pronounced in the rosiglitazone group (P=0.040). There was a statistically significant improvement of HOMAIR in both groups (P=0.008). After treatment, frequencies of menstrual bleeding were significantly higher (P<0.001) and serum total testosterone levels significantly lower in both groups (P = 0.001). Conclusion(s): A 6-month therapy with insulin sensitizers resulted in marked improvement in adipose tissue GLUT4 mRNA expression in PCOS patients, rosiglitazone being more effective when compared with metformin. The augmentation of the insulin signal transduction was accompanied by a significant improvement of HOMAIR, menstrual pattern and androgen profile. © 2008 Society of the European Journal of Endocrinology.

N2  - OBJECTIVE - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an insulin-resistant state with insulin resistance being an established therapeutic target; however, measurement of insulin resistance remains challenging. We aimed to 1) determine serum retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) levels (purported to reflect insulin resistance) in women with PCOS and control subjects, 2) examine the relationship of RBP4 to conventional markers of insulin resistance, and 3) examine RBP4 changes with interventions modulating insulin resistance in overweight women with PCOS. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - At baseline, 38 overweight women (BMI >27 kg/m2) with PCOS and 17 weight-matched control subjects were compared. Women with PCOS were then randomly assigned to 6 months of a higher-dose oral contraceptive pill (OCP) (35 (mug ethinyl estradiol/2 mg cyproterone acetate) or metformin (1 g b.i.d.). Outcome measures were insulin resistance (total insulin area under the curve) on an oral glucose tolerance test, RBP4, and metabolic/inflammatory markers. RESULTS - Overweight women with PCOS were more insulin resistant than control subjects, yet RBP4 levels were not different in women with PCOS versus those in control subjects (35.4 +/-4.3 vs. 28.9 +/-3.1 (mug/ml, P = 0.36). RBP4 correlated with cholesterol and triglycerides but not with insulin resistance. Metformin improved insulin resistance by 35%, whereas the OCP worsened insulin resistance by 33%. However, RBP4 increased nonsignificantly in both groups (43.7 +/-6.3 vs. 42.6 +/-5.5 mug/ml, P = 0.92). CONCLUSIONS - Overweight women with PCOS were more insulin resistant than control subjects, but this finding was not reflected by RBP4 levels. RBP4 correlated with lipid levels but not with insulin resistance markers. RBP4 levels did not change when insulin resistance was reduced by metformin or increased by the OCP. These data suggest that RBP4 is not a useful marker of insulin resistance in PCOS but may reflect other metabolic features of this condition. © 2008 by the American Diabetes Association.

N2  - Objective: There is evidence of preclinical cardiovascular disease even in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The aim of our study was to assess and compare the effects of metformin (MET) and rosiglitazone (ROSI) on endothelial function in PCOS patients. Method(s): For 6 months, 26 women with PCOS received either MET or ROSI. Blood samples for assessment of androgens, lipids, and high-sensitive C-reactive protein were taken at baseline and at endpoint. Endothelium-independent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and glyceryl trini-trate-induced endothelium-independent dilation of brachial artery were studied before and after treatment. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMAIR) calculation was applied as a measure of insulin resistance (IR). Result(s): With treatment, FMD of brachial artery improved significantly from 4.2+/-6.6 to 10.2+/-5.9% in MET group (P=0.036) and from 2.9+/-3.2 to 7.6+/-4.9% in ROSI group (P = 0.026), MET being as effective as ROSI (P=0.70). The endothelium-independent dilation did not change. Additionally, administration of MET was associated with a significant decrease in HOMAIR (P=0.003), serum total and serum-free testosterone (P=0.045 and P=0.008 respectively) and significantly higher frequencies of menstrual bleeding (P=0.006). Conclusion(s): A 6-month therapy with insulin sensitizers, MET and ROSI, resulted in marked improvement of endothelial function in young PCOS patients without clinically evident atherosclerosis who were not severely insulin resistant. Neither drug was superior to the other. We conclude that therapeutic intervention with either insulin sensitizer may reverse the atherosclerotic process in PCOS patients at its early stage. © 2008 European Society of Endocrinology.

N2  - There is a little information in literature about circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentrations in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the results reported are discrepant. In this study, therefore, we aimed (1) to determine the circulating ADMA concentrations in 44 women with PCOS and 22 age- and BMI-matched healthy controls, (2) to evaluate its correlations with insulin resistance, gonadotrophins, and androgen secretion, and (3) to compare effects of metformin and ethinyl estradiol-cyproterone acetate (EE/CPA) treatments on circulating ADMA concentrations. In conclusion, our data indicate that circulating ADMA concentrations in non-obese, non-hypertensive and young women with PCOS are significantly higher than healthy controls and they improved by a 3-month course of metformin and oral contraceptive treatments. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background and aims: Effective treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remains controversial but recently, insulin-sensitizing agents have found usage in PCOS based on the relationship between hyperinsulinemia and ovarian hyperandrogenemia. The present study was undertaken to evaluate and compare the efficacy of metformin versus rosiglitazone on insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia in women with PCOS. Method(s): In this prospective, parallel, randomized, open-label study; insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia were evaluated in 61 subjects with PCOS, out of which 31 subjects received metformin (850 mg/BD) and 30 subjects received rosiglitazone (2 mg/BD) for 12 months. Evaluation of insulin resistance using the homeostasis model insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), area under the curve (AUC) for insulin and AUC for glucose; and evaluation of hyperandrogenemia by clinical/biochemical parameters namely, hirsutism, ovulation, resumption of menstrual cycle, and androgen levels were performed at baseline and 3,6 and 12 months, respectively. Result(s): Clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenemia improved in both groups. Both PCOS groups had normal levels of glucose throughout the study. Insulin levels, at baseline and months 3, 6 and 12 were 13.11 +/- 2.45, 9.94 +/- 2.41, 9.28 +/- 3.25, 8.94 +/- 2.39 and 11.38 +/- 5.16, 9.55 +/- 3.11, 8.22 +/- 3.68, 8.02 +/- 3.78 muU/ml in metformin and rosiglitazone groups respectively (P < 0.05). Corresponding HOMA values were 4.58 +/- 0.22, 3.90 +/- 0.19, 3.84 +/- 0.20 and 2.76 +/- 0.17 in metformin group (P < 0.05), and 4.19 +/- 0.24, 2.77 +/- 0.22, 2.58 +/- 0.20 and 1.90 +/- 0.16 in rosiglitazone group (P < 0.05), whereas, QUICKI values were 0.60 +/- 0.02, 0.65 +/- 0.02, 0.67 +/- 0.02 and 0.66 +/- 0.02 in metformin group (P < 0.05) and 0.63 +/- 0.02, 0.68 +/- 0.02, 0.72 +/- 0.03 and 0.70 +/- 0.02 in rosiglitazone group (P < 0.05), respectively. Conclusion(s): Metformin and rosiglitazone improve outcome measures after treatment; rosiglitazone seems to improve insulin resistance relatively earlier; while metformin had an earlier and more sustained benefit on hyperandrogenemia. © 2007 Diabetes India.

N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) presents in adolescence, and obesity is a common finding. The benefits and risks of alternate approaches to the management of PCOS in obese adolescent women are not clear. Objective(s): We investigated the effects of metformin, oral contraceptives (OCs), and/or lifestyle modification in obese adolescent women with PCOS. Design(s): Two small, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials were performed. Patients and Participants: A total of 79 obese adolescent women with PCOS participated. Intervention(s): In the single treatment trial, subjects were randomized to metformin, placebo, a lifestyle modification program, or OC. In the combined treatment trial, all subjects received lifestyle modification and OC and were randomized to metformin or placebo. Main Outcome Measure(s): Serum concentrations of androgens and lipids were measured. Result(s): Lifestyle modification alone resulted in a 59% reduction in free androgen index with a 122% increase in SHBG. OC resulted in a significant decrease in total testosterone (44%) and free androgen index (86%) but also resulted in an increase in C-reactive protein (39.7%) and cholesterol (14%). The combination of lifestyle modification, OC, and metformin resulted in a 55% decrease in total testosterone, as compared to 33% with combined treatment and placebo, a 4% reduction in waist circumference, and a significant increase in HDL (46%). Conclusion(s): In these preliminary trials, both lifestyle modification and OCs significantly reduce androgens and increase SHBG in obese adolescents with PCOS. Metformin, in combination with lifestyle modification and OC, reduces central adiposity, reduces total testosterone, and increases HDL, but does not enhance overall weight reduction.

N2  - Objective: To determine the incidence of an abnormal glucose tolerance test in patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion and whether metformin would safely reduce the rate of first trimester spontaneous abortions in patients without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as well as with PCOS and an abnormal glucose tolerance test. Design(s): Prospective control clinical trial. Setting(s): Shiraz University-affiliated hospital. Patient(s): Patients with a history of recurrent spontaneous abortion and women with a history of normal full term pregnancy. Intervention(s): The incidence of abnormal carbohydrate metabolism was determined. Metformin and placebo were given to women with an abnormal glucose tolerance test and who had recurrent spontaneous abortions. Main Outcome Measure(s): Continuation of pregnancy beyond the first trimester in all groups and presence or absence of teratogenicity in the delivered baby after metformin therapy. Result(s): Twenty-nine of the patients in the group with recurrent spontaneous abortion were found to have an abnormal glucose tolerance test result compared with just four (5.4%) patients in the normal pregnancy group. The abortion rate was significantly reduced after metformin therapy in patients without PCOS in comparison to the placebo group (15% vs. 55%). Conclusion(s): This study indicates an important link between an abnormal glucose tolerance test and a history of recurrent abortion. It was also found that metformin therapy improves the chances of a successful pregnancy in patients with an abnormal glucose tolerance test. © 2008 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Objective. To evaluate the effects the administration of myo-inositol (MYO) on hormonal parameters in a group of PCOS patients. Design. Controlled clinical study. Setting. PCOS patients in a clinical research environment. Patients. 20 overweight PCOS patients were enrolled after informed consent. Interventions. All patients underwent hormonal evaluations and an oral glucose tollerance test (OGTT) before and after 12 weeks of therapy (Group A (n = 10): myo-inositol 2 gr. plus folic acid 200 mug every day; Group B (n = 10): folic acid 200 mug every day). Ultrasound examinations and Ferriman-Gallwey score were also performed. Main outcome measures. Plasma LH, FSH, PRL, E2, 17OHP, A, T, glucose, insulin, C peptide concentrations, BMI, HOMA index and glucose-to-insulin ratio. Results. After 12 weeks of MYO administration plasma LH, PRL, T, insulin levels and LH/FSH resulted significantly reduced. Insulin sensitivity, expressed as glucose-to-insulin ratio and HOMA index resulted significantly improved after 12 weeks of treatment. Menstrual cyclicity was restored in all amenorrheic and oligomenorrheic subjects. No changes occurred in the patients treated with folic acid. Conclusions. Myo-inositol administration improves reproductive axis functioning in PCOS patients reducing the hyperinsulinemic state that affects LH secretion. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Background. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a major endocrine abnormality that affects women of reproductive age. Oral contraceptive pills are usually the first choice of treatment for PCOS when fertility is not desired. Metformin, an insulin-sensitizing drug, has been shown to improve such metabolic abnormality. Aim. To compare the effects of a contraceptive pill in combination with metformin on the clinical, endocrine and metabolic parameters in obese and non-obese patients with PCOS. Methods. Sixty PCOS patients (25 obese, 35 non-obese) were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. PCOS was defined according to the Rotterdam criteria. Patients were randomized to oral treatment with Diane35 (35 mug ethinyl estradiol plus 2 mg cyproterone acetate), metformin or a combination of Diane35/metformin for 3 months. Body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) score, leuteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, fasting insulin and glucose/insulin ratio were measured at baseline and at the end of treatment. Results. Diane35 resulted in a higher reduction of FG score in both obese and non-obese PCOS patients compared with metformin. Menstrual regularity was restored in all PCOS patients treated with Diane35 compared with only 28% of those receiving metformin. Metformin significantly decreased BMI and WHR in obese patients (p < 0.05). Testosterone levels decreased in all three groups. LH levels and LH/FSH ratio decreased with Diane35 and Diane35/metformin in both obese and non-obese patients. Metformin significantly decreased fasting insulin concentrations (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) and increased the insulin sensitivity (p < 0.05) in both obese and non-obese PCOS patients, while no significant changes were observed in the Diane35 group. In addition, insulin levels also decreased (p < 0.05) in the Diane35/metformin group. Conclusions. Our data show that a combination of metformin and contraceptive pill may be more effective in suppressing the hyperandrogenemia of obese and non-obese PCOS patients than metformin alone and may reduce insulin levels more than contraceptive pill alone. Hence, combined treatment may become a more effective therapeutic option for PCOS. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common metabolism and endocrine disorders among women. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of metformin on lipid profile changes, insulin resistance, body mass index (BMI), Ovulation and pregnancy rates in patients affected by PCO syndrome. Material(s) and Method(s): In this randomized controlled study, 200 women aged 20-35 years with PCOS were selected. Diagnostic criteria were based on the diagnostic criteria of PCO syndrome in Noterdam meeting in 2003. Samples of fasting peripheral blood were taken from all patients to test cholesterol, LDL, HDL, TG, FBS and Insulin before treatment. Patients were then divided randomly into two groups. In case group (n=100), metformin was prescribed three times a day (1500 mg daily) and in control group (n=100), placebo was administered in the same way. After three months, sample of blood was taken again in order to test the variance of the above mentioned parameters to compare with these amounts before test. Also, BMI was compared before and after treatment in both groups. Result(s): BMI was 28.81+/-3.18 and 29.49 +/- 4.7 Kg/m2 before treatment in case and control groups respectively. This ratio changed after treatment to 28.45 +/- 2.8 and 29.29 +/- 4.8 Kg/m2 in case and control groups respectively (P-value>0.05). FSH/insulin ratio was 4.67+/-0.9 and 5.03+/-1.3 in case and control group respectively, while it changed after treatment to 6.07 +/- 1.4 and 5.05 +/-1.3 and this difference was significant in case group (P-value=0.0001),but it was no difference in control group. In case group, HDL level increased after treatment from 26.65+/-9.9 to 33.19+/- 9.9 MMoL/L (P-value=0.0001), and Triglyceride level decreased after treatment from 208.96+/-58.9 to 191.54+/-55.4 MMoL/L (P-value=0.004); whereas there was no change in control group. LDL and cholesterol levels did not change in both groups. Ovulation rate and pregnancy rate were significantly higher in case group than in control group (86% vs. 20%) (P-value=0.003) and (40% vs. 11%) (P=0.021) respectively. In addition, Metformin had no significant effect on BMI in case group. Conclusion(s): Treatment with metformin during 3 months causes not only the increase in ovulation and pregnancy rates but also the decrease in insulin resistance and lipid profile changes.

N2  - Introduction: Despite the high incidence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women attending for facial hair removal there are few studies looking specifically at this patient group. We carried out a split-face study directly comparing the efficacy of a 3 milliseconds pulse duration alexandrite laser with the Lumina IPL system in 38 women with PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): Each patient underwent six treatments using both systems, with 1, 3 and 6 months follow-up. Hair counts, hair-free intervals and patient satisfaction were recorded for all patients. Result(s): After six treatments, alexandrite laser treatment resulted in longer median hair-free intervals when compared to IPL (7 weeks vs. 2 weeks; P < 0.001). Decrease in hair counts was significantly larger on the Alexandrite side compared to the IPL side at 1, 3 and 6 months (52%, 43% and 46% vs. 21%, 21% and 27%; P < 0.001). Patient satisfaction scores, using linear analogue scales (LAS), at 1, 3 and 6 months were significantly higher for the alexandrite laser than the IPL (8.7, 7.8 and 7.7 vs. 5.7, 5.1 and 5.1; P <= 0.002). Conclusion(s): The alexandrite laser resulted in significantly longer hair-free intervals, a larger reduction in hair counts and greater patient satisfaction than the IPL and appeared to be more effective in this patient group. It is clear from the results in this study that the GentleLase alexandrite laser is more effective at reducing facial hirsutism in women with PCOS than the Lumina IPL. It is probable that this is due to the specific wavelength, short pulse duration and single pulse delivery of the GentleLase alexandrite laser, resulting in more follicular destruction than the IPL. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE - We aimed to determine the impact of medical therapy for symptom management on insulin resistance, metabolic profiles, and surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an insulin-resistant pre-diabetes condition. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - One hundred overweight women (BMI >27 kg/m2), average age 31 years, who were nonsmokers, were not pregnant, did not have diabetes, and were off relevant medications for 3 months completed this 6-month open-label controlled trial. Randomization was to a control group (higher-dose oral contraceptive [OCP] 35 mug ethinyl estradiol [EE]/2 mg cyproterone acetate, metformin [1 g b.d.] or low-dose OCP [20 mug EE/100 mug levonorgestrel + aldactone 50 mg b.d.]). Primary outcome measures were insulin resistance (area under curve on oral glucose tolerance test) and surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease including arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) and endothelial function. RESULTS - All treatments similarly and significantly improved symptoms including hirsutism and menstrual cycle length. Insulin resistance was improved by metformin and worsened by the high-dose OCP. Arterial stiffness worsened in the higher-dose OCP group (PWV 7.46 vs. 8.03 m/s, P < 0.05), related primarily to the increased insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS - In overweight women with PCOS, metformin and low- and high-dose OCP preparations have similar efficacy but differential effects on insulin resistance and arterial function. These findings suggest that a low-dose OCP preparation may be preferable if contraception is needed and that metformin should be considered for symptomatic management, particularly in women with additional metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors. © 2007 by the American Diabetes Association.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reasons for women to present seeking removal of facial hair, particularly within the UK National Health Service (NHS). In the NHS, there is geographical variation in the number of laser treatments available to women with PCOS, with some units limiting patients to six treatments whilst others allow unlimited treatments. This study aims to assess the effect of number of treatments on women with PCOS. Method(s): This study prospectively assessed hair counts, hair-free intervals and patient satisfaction in 60 women with PCOS undergoing 3 ms pulse duration alexandrite laser treatment. Result(s): Following six treatments there was a mean 31 +/- 38% reduction in hair counts (mean +/- SD; P = 0.001). Mean hair-free interval (HFI) increased steadily with treatment, from 1.9 weeks after six treatments to 4.3 weeks after 10 treatments (P = 0.001). From the postal questionnaire, after an average of 12 treatments, 31% of patients had a HFI longer than 6 weeks compared to only 2.6% after six treatments (P = 0.003). Overall, despite the low hair count reductions, 95% of patients were satisfied with treatment. Conclusion(s): In women with PCOS, laser treatment is associated with a poorer than expected reduction in hair counts and HFI following treatment. However, offering more than six treatments does have additional benefits in terms of prolonging HFI and overall patient satisfaction with treatment is very high. © 2006.

N2  - Context: To date, the metabolic effects of the long-term metformin administration in anovulatory patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are known, whereas few data are available on the effects of its suspension. Objective(s): The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of metformin suspension on insulin sensitivity in PCOS patients. Design(s): This was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Setting(s): The study was conducted at the University "Magna Graecia" of Catanzaro, Italy. Patient(s): Patients included 30 normal-weight anovulatory PCOS women and 10 age- and body mass index-matched healthy controls. Intervention(s): PCOS patients were randomized to receive 1700 mg daily metformin (metformin group) or placebo tables (placebo group) for 12 months, whereas no treatment was administered in healthy women (control group). Main Outcome Measure(s): Clinical, endocrine, and metabolic profile and clamp insulin sensitivity index were evaluated at study entry and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Result(s): At baseline, the clamp insulin sensitivity index resulted significantly different (P < 0.05) in PCOS patients in comparison with healthy controls, without difference between metformin and placebo groups. During treatment, the clamp insulin sensitivity index was significantly improved (P < 0.05) in the metformin group in comparison with baseline and placebo group, without significant differences between the 6- and 12-month assessments. At 6 and 12 months after treatment suspension, in the metformin group, insulin sensitivity index significantly (P < 0.05) worsened in comparison with that observed at baseline and during treatment and with that observed in the placebo and control groups. Conclusion(s): In normal-weight anovulatory PCOS patients, longterm metformin administration exerts beneficial effects on peripheral insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, this effect disappears at treatment suspension. Copyright © 2007 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - Objective: The aim of the present study is to evaluate sub-groups of PCOS patients who will benefit from metformin therapy and to find out any predictors of ovulation in PCOS sub-groups. Method(s): In the current prospective-randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, PCOS patients (n = 116) were divided into six main groups according to glucose to insulin ratio (G-I ratio mg/10 -4 U) and body mass index (BMI kg/m2) as: Group 1: normoinsulinemic (G-I ratio >= 4.5 mg/10-4 U), lean (BMI < 25) (n = 37); Group 2: normoinsulinemic, overweight (BMI: 25-29.9) (n = 19); Group 3: normoinsulinemic, obese (BMI >= 30) (n = 18); Group 4: hyperinsulinemic (G-I ratio < 4.5 mg/10-4 U), lean (n = 28); Group 5: hyperinsulinemic, overweight (n = 17); Group 6: hyperinsulinemic, obese (n = 20). Patients in each group were randomized onto placebo or metformin treatments (850 mg two to three times per day according to BMI). The rate of ovulation, biochemical profile, hormonal profile and clinical symptoms of hyperandrogenism were evaluated before and after 6 months of metformin and placebo treatments. Result(s): We observed a significant decrease in WHR following metformin therapy in the normoinsulinemic overweight sub-group (P < 0.05). The duration of the menstrual cycle significantly decreased in the normoinsulinemic obese sub-group on metformin therapy (P < 0.05). Metformin had a significant effect on hirsutism scores in hyperinsulinemic lean women (P < 0.05) and decreased DHEAS levels significantly in the lean hyperinsulinemic and normoinsulinemic groups (P < 0.05). Metformin had significant effects on ovulation in only lean hyperinsulinemic women (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Clinical outcomes of metformin therapy may be categorized on the basis of basal BMI and insulin levels in PCOS patients. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Elevated levels of plasma homocysteine (Hcy) have been implicated as a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although long-term treatment with metformin can increase Hcy levels in patients with type II diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease, it is becoming an increasingly accepted and widespread medication in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In the literature, only one study has demonstrated that metformin increases Hcy levels in PCOS patients, but the effect of other insulin sensitizers on Hcy levels have not been reported previously in women with PCOS. We aimed to assess the effects of metformin and rosiglitazone on plasma Hcy levels in patients with PCOS. Method(s): Thirty women were randomized to two groups: 15 women in group 1 received 850 mg of metformin twice daily for 3 months. In group 2, 15 women received 4 mg of rosiglitazone for 3 months. In both groups, body mass index, menstrual pattern, and plasma total Hcy, insulin, glucose and lipid metabolism parameters were recorded at baseline and at 3 months. Result(s): Hcy levels increased from 8.93 +/- 0.49 to 11.26 +/- 0.86 mumol/l (P = 0.002) and from 10.70 +/- 0.86 to 12.36 +/- 0.81 mumol/l (P = 0.01) in the metformin and rosiglitazone groups, respectively. Apolipoprotein (Apo) A1 levels increased from 127.10 +/- 6.85 to 145.7 +/- 7.18 mg/dl (P = 0.018) in the metformin group. Total cholesterol (total-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), lipoprotein (a) and Apo B levels decreased in the metformin group, but the change was not significant. Total-C levels decreased from 161.15 +/- 8.94 to 150.23 +/- 8.73 mg/dl (P = 0.026), HDL-C decreased from 43.13 +/- 2.65 to 39.15 +/- 2.52 mg/dl (P = 0.005) and LDL-C levels decreased from 93.83 +/- 6.06 to 80.7 +/- 2.30 mg/dl (P = 0.021) in the rosiglitazone group. Conclusion(s): Treatment with insulin sensitizers in women with PCOS may lead to increases in Hcy levels. © The Author 2004.

N2  - Background: Neither oral contraceptives (COC) nor metformin are an optimal modality for the long-term treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a combination of both is beneficial over COC monotherapy. Method(s): Altogether, 30 women were included in the study and 28 finished the protocol. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups treated with either COC (COC group) or COC and metformin (1500 mg/day) (METOC group) for 6 months. Anthropometric parameters, androgens, lipids, fasting insulin, glucose and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations were measured before and at the end of the sixth cycle of treatment. The insulin sensitivity index was evaluated using the euglycaemic clamp. Result(s): There were no significant changes in anthropometric parameters, fasting glucose or insulin sensitivity in either group. Total testosterone, free androgen index, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone decreased and SHBG increased significantly in both groups. When comparing the effect of both treatments, only a more pronounced decrease in free androgen index was found in the METOC group. Conclusion(s): Adding metformin slightly modified the treatment effect of COC, causing a more significant decrease in the free androgen index but having no additional positive impact on lipids, insulin sensitivity, SHBG or testosterone. The available data do not offer enough evidence to advocate the standard use of combined treatment in PCOS. Whether the combination might be beneficial for specific subgroups of patients is of further interest. © European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved.

N2  - Background: A relationship between reduced fetal growth and the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been proposed in girls with PCOS. However, the birth weight in the offspring of PCOS mothers has not been systematically investigated. The aim of this study was to establish the birth weight of newborns of mothers with PCOS and to compare it with a control group of newborns of normal women matched by age and weight at the beginning of pregnancy. Method(s): The birth weight of 47 infants born from singleton pregnancies in women with well-documented PCOS was compared with 180 infants born from singleton pregnancies in healthy controls. Result(s): The prevalence of small for gestational age (SGA) infants was significantly higher in the PCOS group compared to the control group (12.8% versus 2.8%, respectively, P<0.02). Moreover, SGA infants born to PCOS mothers were smaller than those born to control mothers (P<0.05). The prevalence of large for gestational age infants (LGA) was similar in both groups, but birth length of LGA newborns was greater in PCOS women than controls (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): PCOS mothers showed a significantly higher prevalence of SGA newborns which cannot be completely attributed to pregnancy complications, and seems to be more related to the PCOS condition of the mother. © The Author 2005.

N2  - Severe insulin resistance is a key abnormality in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance (IR) and hyperandrogenism to the same extent as metformin in obese women with PCOS who have not received any previous treatment. Fifty-two women with PCOS were randomly allocated to receive either pioglitazone (30 mg/d, n = 25) or metformin (850 mg three times daily, n = 27) and were assessed before and after 6 months. Body weight, body mass index, and waist to hip ratio increased significantly (P <= 0.05) after pioglitazone treatment but not after metformin treatment. Fasting serum insulin concentration (P < 0.001 for both drugs) and the area under the insulin curve during a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test decreased after pioglitazone (P < 0.002) or metformin (P < 0.05) treatment. IR (homeostasis model of assessment-IR index) decreased and insulin sensitivity (elevation of the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and the fasting glucose to insulin ratio) increased (P <= 0.008) after treatment with either drug. Hirsutism (P < 0.05) and serum concentrations of free testosterone (P < 0.02) and androstenedione (P < 0.01) declined to a similar extent after treatment with the drugs. Treatment with pioglitazone or metformin was associated with the occurrence of pregnancy (n = 5 and n = 3, respectively). These results suggest that pioglitazone is as effective as metformin in improving insulin sensitivity and hyperandrogenism, despite an increase in body weight, body mass index, and the waist to hip ratio associated with pioglitazone.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In addition to numerous health detriments caused by obesity, fertility and pregnancy success may also be compromised. The aims of this study were to compare the effects of obesity and morbid obesity on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. We also investigated the effects of obesity on obstetric outcomes after IVF treatment. METHOD(S): Retrospective study of women less than 38 years of age during their first fresh IVF cycle (January 1995 to April 2005). RESULT(S): A total of 1,293 women were included in the study, with 236 obese women (body mass index [BMI] = 30-39.9) and 79 morbidly obese women (BMI >= 40). The morbidly obese group had a 25.3% IVF cycle cancellation rate compared with 10.9% in normal-weight women (odds ratio 2.73, 95% confidence interval 1.49-5.0), P < .001). Morbidly obese women without polycystic ovarian syndrome had an even higher cancellation rate (33%). Women with higher BMI required significantly more days of gonadotropin stimulation but had lower peak estradiol levels (P < .001). There were no significant differences in clinical pregnancy or delivery rates between the four BMI groups. Of the women who delivered, there was a significant linear trend for risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and cesarean delivery with increasing BMI (P < .03). CONCLUSION(S): We report a significantly higher risk for IVF cycle cancellation in morbidly obese patients with no effect of BMI on clinical pregnancy or delivery rate. However, obese and morbidly obese subjects had a significantly higher risk for obstetric complications. This target population should be aggressively counseled regarding their increased obstetric risk and offered treatment options for weight reduction before the initiation of fertility therapy. © 2006 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

N2  - In order to explore the effects of metformin combined with cyproterone acetate (CPA) on the clinical features, endocrine and metabolism of the patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), 50 cases of non-obese PCOS were randomly subjected to CPA (CPA treatment group, n = 25) and CPA+ metformin (n = 25) treatment for 6 months. Before and after treatment the body mass index (BMI), waist : hip ratio (WHR), ovarian volume, serum gonadotrophin, androgen and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, and fasting lipid, glucose and insulin levels were measured. The results showed that all of the parameters in two groups were similar before treatment. After treatment for 6 months in the CPA+ metformin group, BMI and WHR were significantly decreased, while insulin sensitivity was significantly decreased as Compared with those before treatment. In CPA group, no significant changes were found before and after treatment. Combined use of CPA and metformin could result in the reduction of serum androstenedione and increases of serum SHBG levels as compared with the CPA treatment alone. It was concluded that combined use of CPA and metformin could improve the insulin sensitivity, and further suppress the hyperandrogenism in non-obese women with PCOS.

T1  - Pregnancy outcomes after laparoscopic ovarian drilling in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome
A1  - Al-Ojaimi E.H. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Objectives: To study whether there is an increased risk of glucose intolerance and hypertensive complications during pregnancy in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) who conceived after laparoscopic ovarian drilling and to investigate if there is an adverse pregnancy outcome. Method(s): This prospective study took place at Salmaniya Medical Complex in Bahrain, between June 1996 and June 2003. We compared the pregnancy and neonatal outcomes of 134 patients with PCOS who were treated with laparoscopic ovarian drilling with 479 pregnant women without PCOS (controls). We used the multiple logistic regression analysis to assess the risk of PCOS on impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) and premature delivery. Result(s): Subjects with PCOS had a significantly greater prepregnancy body mass index, prevalence of obesity and nulliparity as compared with controls. The incidence of IGT (p=0.007), GDM (p=0.01) and HDP (p=0.001) were significantly higher in pregnant PCOS compared with the control group. There were no significant differences in the neonatal outcomes and prevalence of premature delivery between the 2 study groups. When non-obese PCOS patients were compared with non-obese controls, the incidence of GDM (p=0.04) and HDP (p=0.004) were still significantly higher in the former. The prevalence of pregnancy complications were not significantly different when obese PCOS were compared with obese control patients. The PCOS was demonstrated as a risk factor for IGT (p=0.05), GDM (p=0.03) and HDP (p=0.03), but not for premature delivery. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS who conceived after the drilling were at higher risk of IGT, GDM and HDP, and this risk seemed to be independent of maternal obesity.

N2  - Objective: To determine whether metformin or placebo could, in conjunction with healthy lifestyle counseling, decrease serum testosterone levels and related aberrations in adolescents with hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinemia, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Design(s): Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Setting(s): Pediatric university teaching hospital. Participant(s): Twenty-two adolescents aged 13 to 18 years with hyperinsulinemia and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Intervention(s): Participants were randomly assigned to take a 12-week course of either metformin or placebo. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pretreatment and posttreatment oral glucose tolerance tests, fasting lipid profiles, and clinical measurements. Result(s): There was a significant decline in mean serum testosterone concentration with metformin (-38.3 ng/dL) compared with placebo (-0.86 ng/dL) (95% confidence interval, - to -0.29 for the mean difference between groups). At completion, the relative risk of menses was 2.50 times higher in the metformin group compared with the placebo (95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 5.58). Measures of insulin sensitivity, including insulin area under the curve and HOMA (homeostasis model assessment), demonstrated improvement only with metformin, but these did not reach statistical significance. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased by 6.98 mg/dL with metformin vs a decrease of -2.33 mg/dL with placebo (95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 18.23 for the mean difference between groups). There were no significant changes in body mass index, hirsutism, triglyceride levels, or total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Conclusion(s): Metformin significantly lowered total testosterone concentrations, increased the likelihood of menses, and improved high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels without affecting measures of insulin sensitivity or body weight. ©2006 American Medical Association.

N2  - Purpose: This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of two different oral contraceptives (OCs) on homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism in 20 women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): Women were randomly allocated to receive either the biphasic OC containing 40/30 mug ethynylestradiol (EE)+25/125 mug desogestrel (DSG; n=10) or the monophasic OC containing 35 mug EE and 2 mg cyproterone acetate (CPA; n=10). Investigations were performed before and after 6 months of treatment. Fasting vitamin B12, folate, Hcy and insulin sensitivity (SI), and glucose utilization independent of insulin (Sg), by the minimal model method, were evaluated. Result(s): Folate and vitamin B12 were not significantly modified by either OC. EE/DSG decreased SI (2.53+/-0.35 vs. 1.68+/-0.45; p<.05), without modifying Hcy (9.54+/-0.7 mumol/L vs. 9.18+/-0.6 mumol/L). EE/CPA improved SI (1.47+/-0.38 vs. 3.27+/-0.48; p<.04) and decreased Hcy (9.8+/-1.9 mumol/L vs. 7.9+/-0.9 mumol/L; p<.05). This study indicates that in women with PCOS, EE/CPA, but not EE/DSG, improves IS and decreases fasting Hcy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: To compare the effects of combined oral contraceptives (OCs) containing cyproterone acetate or desogestrel on insulin sensitivity in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): A prospective randomized clinical trial. Setting(s): Outpatient gynecological clinic of Aretaieion University Hospital. Patient(s): Thirty-six adolescent girls with hyperandrogenism and six or less menses in the preceding 12 months. Intervention(s): Patients were separated in two groups: group A (n = 18) received 0.15 mg of desogestrel plus 0.030 mg of ethinyl E2 daily; and group B (n = 18) received 2 mg of cyproterone acetate plus 0.035 mg of ethinyl E2 daily, for 21 days followed by a 7-day rest, for 12 months. Main Outcome Measure(s): Hirsutism score, lipid, androgen, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels were evaluated at baseline. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and metabolism indices, based on previously studied mathematical formulas, were assessed at baseline and at 12 months. Result(s): After 12 months of treatment, the homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance increased significantly in both groups. The fasting glucose-to-insulin ratio and predicted insulin sensitivity index decreased in group B. The delta of the area under the OGTT curve for insulin and predicted first and second phase insulin secretion indices increased significantly only in group B. Conclusion(s): We conclude that treatment of adolescent girls with PCOS with the two combined OCs administered, results in unfavorable changes of insulin sensitivity. In addition, cyproterone acetate is associated with an increase of insulin secretion and hyperinsulinemia. ©2006 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Objective: To establish whether metformin has a significant action in reducing visceral fat and improving other metabolic parameters in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting(s): Reproductive medicine clinic. Population: Forty women with anovulatory PCOS. Method(s): Participants were randomised into receiving metformin 500 mg three times a day or placebo for 3 months. Main Outcome Measure(s): Fat distribution was measured by computed tomography scan. Secondary outcome measures included serum indices of the metabolic syndrome and evidence of ovulation. Result(s): We found no significant differences in any of the measures of fat distribution between the placebo and metformin groups. The metformin group had significantly lower total cholesterol (P = 0.02), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.02) and cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (P = 0.05), but there was no statistically significant treatment effect on androgens, insulin, insulin resistance, triglycerides, ovulation or pregnancy. Conclusion(s): Metformin has no clinically significant effect in reducing visceral fat mass, although it does have a beneficial effect on lipids. This trial lends support to the growing evidence that metformin is not a weight loss drug. Metformin might therefore be used as an adjunct to lifestyle modification in women with PCOS, but not as a substitute for it. © RCOG 2006 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

N2  - Context: The few controlled trials performed so far indicate that the addition of metformin and/or flutamide to a hypocaloric diet in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) effectively influences different phenotypic aspects of the syndrome. All these studies are, however, characterized by a short to medium period of treatment. Objective(s): Our objective was to investigate the long-term effects of these therapies. Design and Setting: We conducted a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial at a medical center. Patient(s): Of 80 overweight-obese women with PCOS, 76 completed the study. Intervention(s): Patients were placed on a hypocaloric diet for the first month and then on a hypocaloric diet plus placebo, metformin (850 mg, orally, twice a day), flutamide (250 mg, orally, twice a day), or metformin plus flutamide for the subsequent 12 months (20 subjects in each group). Main Outcome Measure(s): We assessed clinical features, computerized tomography measurement of fat distribution, androgens, lipids, and fasting and glucose-stimulated glucose and insulin levels at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. Result(s): After 6 months, compared with placebo, flutamide further decreased visceral/sc fat mass (P = 0.044), androstenedione (P < 0.001), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P < 0.001), and hirsutism score (P < 0.001), whereas metformin further increased frequency of menstruation (P = 0.039). After 12 months, flutamide maintained the effects observed after 6 months on visceral/sc fat mass (P = 0.033) and androstenedione (P < 0.001), whereas it produced an additional decrease in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P = 0.020) and hirsutism score (P = 0.019); metformin further improved the menstrual pattern (P = 0.013). Moreover, after 12 months, flutamide improved more than placebo the menstrual pattern (P = 0.008), glucose-stimulated glucose levels (P = 0.041), insulin sensitivity (P < 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P = 0.003), whereas metformin decreased glucose-stimulated insulin levels (P = 0.014). The combination of the two drugs maintained the specific effect of each of the compounds, without any additive or synergistic effect. Conclusion(s): These findings add relevance to the usefulness of metformin and flutamide in the treatment of dieting overweight-obese PCOS women and provide a rationale for targeting different therapeutic options according to the required outcomes in the long term.

N2  - Objective. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of metformin exposure during pregnancy on neonates of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients. Method. Neonatal outcomes of 33 women with PCOS treated with metformin during pregnancy were compared to neonatal outcomes of 66 normal healthy women in a retrospective case-control study. Results. The mean birth weight percentile of neonates exposed to metformin in utero during the first trimester was significantly lower than that of neonates delivered to normal healthy matched controls. After controlling for pregnancy complications, this observation became only marginally statistically significant. Conclusion. Although metformin is an attractive option for induction of ovulation in PCOS patients, there is a need for more evidence related to its safety during pregnancy. © 2006 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Context: Metformin is successfully used in the treatment of cycle disorders and anovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). No data of the exact point and the impact of insulin resistance (IR) on metformin's efficacy exist. Objective(s): The objective of the study was to evaluate the early potential effects of metformin treatment, their time of onset, and the role of IR on metformin's efficacy. Design(s): This was a prospective randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial. Setting(s): The study was conducted at the University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. Patient(s): The patient population was 45 oligo-/anovulatory PCOS women with typical ovaries. Intervention(s): Women were stratified for IR (32 of 13) and then randomly allocated to receive either metformin (n = 22) or placebo (n = 23) and were assessed before and every 4 wk within a treatment period of 12 wk. Main Outcome Measure(s): Menstrual disturbance and markers of insulin metabolism were measured. Result(s): The main outcome criterion menstrual disturbance was successfully improved in the metformin-treated group, depending on IR (12 of 15 vs. three of 17), whereas women without IR (four of seven vs. four of six) had no significant amelioration of their menstrual irregularities (P < 0.05). Estradiol levels increased continuously only in the treatment group (P < 0.005), indicating an improvement of ovulatory function. Sixty-seven percent of metformin-treated women had at least one ovulation, compared with only 45% in the placebo group, shown by biphasic body temperature curves. Insulin sensitivity improved within 4 wk after beginning of metformin as shown by an increased area under the curve glucose to insulin ratio, compared with baseline (P < 0.005). Conclusion(s): IR is a baseline predictor of clinical efficacy in metformin treatment in PCOS women measured by improved menstrual cyclicity and ovulatory function.

T1  - Flutamide-metformin plus ethinylestradiol-drospirenone for lipolysis and antiatherogenesis in young women with ovarian hyperandrogenism: The key role of metformin at the start and after more than one year of therapy

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Flutamide (Flu)-metformin (Met) with ethinylestradiol-drospirenone is a combination therapy that reduces the total and abdominal fat excess, diminishes the lean mass deficit, and attenuates the dysadipocytokinemia of young and nonobese women with ovarian hyperandrogenism, a variant of polycystic ovary syndrome. We have now questioned the need: 1) to add Met at the start of Flu plus ethinylestradiol-drospirenone; and 2) to maintain Met after more than 1 yr on full combination therapy. The additive effects of Met (850 mg/d) were assessed in studies A and B, over 3 months, in young patients with hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenism. In study A, all participants [n = 31; age ~16 yr; body mass index ~ 22 kg/m2] started on Flu (62.5 mg/d) and an oral contraceptive (ethinyl-estradiol + drospirenone), and they were randomized to receive Met in addition or not. In study B, all participants (n = 42; age ~19 yr; body mass index ~ 22 kg/m2) had been treated with Flu-Met plus the same contraceptive for a mean duration of 17 months, and they were randomized for discontinuation of Met or not. Fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, testosterone, lipid profile, adiponectin, and IL-6 were determined at the start and after 3 months, together with body composition, by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. The results of studies A and B complemented each other; the addition of Met was found to have consistently (more) normalizing effects on IL-6 and adiponectin, on lean mass (mean Met benefit of +1.2 kg in study A and +0.6 kg in study B), and in particular on abdominal fat excess [Met benefit of -0.7 kg (A) and -0.3 kg (B)]. In conclusion, Met proved to be a pivotal component of a prime combination therapy that attenuates the dysadipocytokinemia, the lean mass deficit, and the central adiposity of young patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.

N2  - Objective: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) exhibit risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Insulin sensitizers, especially metformin, have been shown to improve these metabolic disturbances, but there are only a few studies on their effects on serum lipids in polycystic ovary syndrome. Method(s): Thirty-five women with PCOS (18 obese and 17 non-obese) were randomized to 6-month treatments with metformin or ethinyl estradiol-cyproterone acetate oral contraceptive pills. Result(s): In the whole-study population (non-obese and obese women) serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased from 1.4+/-0.2 to 1.6+/-0.1 mmol/l (means+/-S.E. throughout) at 3 and 6 months (P < 0.001), the total cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio decreased significantly from 3.8+/-0.3 to 3.3+/-0.2 at 6 months (P < 0.001) and a similar trend was observed in serum triglyceride levels during metformin treatment. In the oral contraceptive group, serum levels of total cholesterol increased from 4.9+/-0.3 to 5.4+/-0.3 mmol/l (P < 0.05), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased from 1.2+/-0.1 to 1.5+/-0.1 mmol/l (P < 0.001), the total cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio decreased from 4.6+/-0.4 to 3.7+/-0.2 (P < 0.001) and triglycerides increased from 1.3+/-0.1 to 1.9+/-0.2 mmol/l at 6 months of treatment (P < 0.001). Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels remained unchanged during both treatments. Milder but similar changes in the subgroups of obese and non-obese women were observed during both treatments. Moreover, in the whole-study population both systolic (P = 0.02) and diastolic (P = 0.05) blood pressures decreased over the 6 months of metformin treatment. Conclusion(s): In women with PCOS, metformin treatment had beneficial effects on lipid profile and blood pressure, and therefore it could be useful in the prevention of cardiovascular complications in these women. cr 2005 Society of the European Journal of Endocrinology.

N2  - Background: Facial hirsutism is one of the characteristic features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and this can lead to high levels of depression and anxiety. Objective(s): To evaluate the impact of laser treatment on the severity of facial hirsutism and on psychological morbidity in women with PCOS. Method(s): A randomized controlled trial of five high-fluence treatments (intervention) vs. five low-fluence treatments (control) was performed over 6 months in a National Health Service teaching hospital. Subjects were 88 women with facial hirsutism due to PCOS recruited from hospital outpatient clinics and a patient support group in 2001-2002. The main outcomes were self-reported severity of facial hair (measured on a scale of 1-10), depression, anxiety (measured on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and quality of life (measured on the WHOQOL-BREF). Result(s): Self-reported severity of facial hair in the intervention group (n = 51) fell from 7.3 to 3.6 over the 6-month study period; for the control group (n = 37) the corresponding scores were 7.1 and 6.1. The change was significantly greater in the intervention group [ANCOVA F(1.83) = 24.5, P < 0.05]. Self-reported time spent on hair removal declined from 112 to 21 min per week in the intervention group and from 92 to 56 min in the control group [F(1.80) = 10.2, P <= 0.05]. Mean depression scores fell from 6.7 to 3.6 in the intervention group, compared with 6.1 to 5.4 in the control group [F(1.83) = 14.7, P < 0.05]. A similar change was seen for mean anxiety scores: intervention 11.1 to 8.2, control 9.6 to 9.3 [F(1.84) = 17.8, P < 0.05]. Psychological quality of life also improved more in the intervention group, from 49.6 to 61.2 vs. 50.1 to 51.5 in the control group [F(1.84) = 10.9, P < 0.05]. Conclusion(s): Laser treatment appeared to reduce the severity of facial hair and time spent on hair removal as well as alleviating depression and anxiety in women with PCOS. These findings suggest that ways of making this method of hair removal more widely available to women with facial hirsutism should be considered. © 2005 British Association of Dermatologists.

N2  - Objective: We evaluated the hypothesis that metformin would improve signs and symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents as compared to oral contraceptive pills (OCP) and have a favorable effect on obesity. Study Design: Thirty-five obese, post-menarchal, non-sexually active adolescents aged 12-21 years with PCOS and hyperinsulinism were randomly assigned to receive either OCP or metformin for 6 months. Result(s): There was a significant decrease in BMI in the two groups over time, from 40.1 to 38.6 in the OCP group, and 37.3 to 36.3 in the metformin group, p = 0.0026, but no significant difference in the degree of change between the two groups. Both groups had decreased free testosterone (OCP: 1.8 pg/ml to 0.96 pg/ml; metformin: 2.1 pg/ml to 1.6 pg/ml), p <0.0001, and improvements in insulin resistance as evidenced by increased glucose/insulin (G/I) ratio (p <0.005) and increased QUICK1 scores (p <0.0005). No significant differences in response to treatment were found between the metformin and OCP groups in outcome variables. Conclusion(s): Adolescents with PCOS treated with metformin or OCP experienced similar beneficial outcomes including reduction in androgen levels, weight loss, and increased insulin sensitivity. The choice of a treatment agent for long-term use will depend on safety profiles, therapeutic goals and patient adherence. © Freund Publishing House Ltd., London.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Context: Metformin treatment of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is widespread, as determined by studies with diverse patient populations. No comparative examination of weight changes or metabolite responses to different doses has been reported. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to determine whether different doses of metformin (1500 or 2550 mg/d) would have different effects on body weight, circulating hormones, markers of inflammation, and lipid profiles. Design(s): The study included prospective cohorts randomized to two doses of metformin. Setting(s): The study was performed at a university teaching hospital with patients from gynecology/endocrinology clinics. Patient(s): The patients studied were obese (body mass index, 30 to <37 kg/m2; n = 42) and morbidly obese (body mass index, >=37 kg/m2; n = 41) women with PCOS. Intervention(s): Patients were randomized to two doses of metformin, and parameters were assessed after 4 and 8 months. Main Outcome Measure(s): The main outcome measures were changes in body mass, circulating hormones, markers of inflammation, and lipid profiles. Result(s): Intention to treat analyses showed significant weight loss in both dose groups. Only the obese subgroup showed a dose relationship (1.5 and 3.6 kg in 1500- and 2550-mg groups, respectively; P = 0.04). The morbidly obese group showed similar reductions (3.9 and 3.8 kg) in both groups. Suppression of androstenedione was significant with both metformin doses, but there was no clear dose relationship. Generally, beneficial changes in lipid profiles were not related to dose. Conclusion(s): Weight loss is a feature of protracted metformin therapy in obese women with PCOS, with greater weight reduction potentially achievable with higher doses. Additional studies are required to determine whether other aspects of the disorder may benefit from the higher dose of metformin. Copyright © 2005 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - Background: Investigation of a possible effect of metformin on androgen levels in pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted. Forty pregnant women with PCOS received diet and lifestyle counselling and were randomized to either metformin 850 mg twice daily or placebo. Primary outcome measures were changes in serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, androstenedione, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, and free testosterone index. Secondary outcome measures were pregnancy complications and outcome. Two-tailed t-tests and chi2-tests were used. Result(s): Maternal androgen levels were unaffected by metformin treatment in pregnant women with PCOS. While none of the 18 women in the metformin group experienced a severe pregnancy or postpartum complication, seven of the 22 (32%) women experienced severe complications in the placebo group (P = 0.01). Conclusion(s): Metformin treatment did not reduce maternal androgen levels in pregnant women with PCOS. In the metformin-treated group we observed a reduction of severe, pregnancy and post-partum complications. Metformin treatment of pregnant PCOS women may reduce complications during pregnancy and in the post-partum period. © European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved.

N2  - Background: We prospectively assessed growth and motor-social development during the first 18 months of life in 126 live births (122 pregnancies) to 109 women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who conceived on and continued metformin (1.5-2.55 g/day) through pregnancy. Method(s): The lengths and weights of PCOS neonates were compared with gender-specific Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) infant data. Gestational diabetes (GD) and pre-eclampsia in women with PCOS were compared with 252 healthy women without PCOS who had >=1 live birth (262 live births). Result(s): There were 101 out of 126 (80%) term (>=37 gestational weeks) PCOS births, which was not significantly different (P = 0.7) from controls, 206 out of 252 (81.7%). There were two (1.6%) birth defects. GD occurred in nine out of 119 PCOS pregnancies (7.6%) versus 40 out of 251 (15.9%) controls, P = 0.027. The prevalence of pre-eclampsia did not differ in PCOS versus control pregnancies (4.1 versus 3.6%, P = 0.8). The birth length and weight of the 52 male neonates did not differ (P > 0.05) from those of CDC males; the 74 female neonates were shorter than CDC females (48.9 +/- 5.4 versus 50.6 +/- 2.7 cm, P = 0.006) and weighed less (3.09 +/- 0.85 versus 3.29 +/- 0.52 kg, P = 0.04). There were no systematic differences in growth between PCOS and CDC infants over 18 months. At 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months, of a potential 100% motor-social development score, scores (+/-SD) were 95 +/- 13, 98 +/- 8%, 95 +/- 10, 97 +/- 8 and 94 +/- 16%; no infants had motor-social developmental delays. Conclusion(s): Metformin reduced development of GD, was not teratogenic and did not adversely affect birth length and weight, growth or motor-social development in the first 18 months of life. © European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to compare the pregnancy outcome, especially the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), in a group of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), with a group of healthy weight-matched women. Method(s): Retrospectively, we evaluated the pregnancies of 66 women with PCOS, who had been treated for infertility and who delivered at our department. These were compared with a group of 66 age- and weight-matched controls. Result(s): We did not find any significant differences in the prevalence of pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and premature deliveries between the group of PCOS patients and the controls. Conclusion(s): When differences in age and weight between PCOS patients and controls are negligible, PCOS is not associated with a higher risk of pregnancy complications.

N2  - Objective To obtain data from a pilot randomized trial on the effect of metformin therapy and lifestyle modification on ovulation and androgen concentrations in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Setting Academic medical center. Patient(s) Thirty-eight overweight or obese women with PCOS. Intervention(s) All subjects were randomized to one of four 48-week interventions: metformin 850 mg two times per day, lifestyle modification plus metformin 850 mg two times per day, lifestyle modification plus placebo, or placebo alone. Main outcome measure(s) Recruitment, dropout, and compliance with a long-term lifestyle intervention in PCOS; preliminary estimates of treatment effect on ovulation, as measured by weekly urinary pregnanediol glucuronide, and on total T and free androgen index. Result(s) It was necessary to screen seven women to have one subject randomized. The dropout rate was 39%, with the majority of dropouts occurring within the first 24 weeks. Mean body mass index was >39 mg/kg2. Modest weight reduction was found in all treatment groups, with the most significant reduction occurring with the combination of metformin and lifestyle intervention. Significant androgen reduction occurred in the combination group only. Ovulation rates did not differ significantly between groups. However, when data were analyzed by presence or absence of weight reduction in subjects, independent of treatment group, the estimated odds ratio for weight loss was 9.0 (95% confidence interval 1.2-64.7) with respect to regular ovulation. If weight loss occurred during metformin therapy, the odds ratio for regular ovulation was 16.2 (95% confidence interval 4.4-60.2). Conclusion(s) Key methodologic issues for a large-scale, randomized trial of lifestyle intervention in PCOS include minimizing early dropout from the lifestyle intervention and including a range of body mass index that is not skewed toward severe obesity. Weight reduction might play the most significant role in restoration of ovulation in obese women with PCOS. © 2004 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

T1  - Ethinylestradiol-drospirenone, flutamide-metformin, or both for adolescents and women with hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenism: Opposite effects on adipocytokines and body adiposity
A1  - Ibanez L.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenism with anovulation, the so-called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is the most frequent endocrine disorder of young women. One of the stigmata of PCOS is a deficit of lean mass and an excess of fat, in particular, abdominal fat, even in the absence of obesity. Adiponectin and IL-6 are among the adipocytokines that have recently been related to abdominal fat excess, insulin resistance states, and cardiovascular disease risk. We studied the effects of two new treatment options, ethinylestradiol-drospirenone and flutamide-metformin, and of their combination on adipocytokinemia and body adiposity in adolescents and women with PCOS. Adolescents with PCOS (n = 32; age, ~15 yr; body mass index, ~22 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to receive the oral contraceptive (OC) ethinylestradiol-drospirenone, or the low-dose generic duo of flutamide (62.5 mg/d) plus metformin (850 mg/d). Young women with PCOS (n = 22; age, ~19 yr; body mass index, ~22 kg/m2) were randomized to receive the same OC, either alone or with flutamide-metformin. Fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, lipids, androgens, IL-6, adiponectin, and body composition (by absorptiometry) were assessed at the start, and after 3 and/or 9 months. At the start, serum concentrations of the proinflammatory IL-6 were high, and those of the antiinflammatory adiponectin were low; body composition was adipose in each subpopulation. Abnormal adipocytokine levels, hypertriglyceridemia, and body adiposity diverged further from the norm in adolescents on OC; in contrast, girls on flutamide-metformin reverted all study indices toward normal, lost part of their fat excess, and reduced their lean mass deficit. In comparison to the girls on OC, those on flutamide-metformin lost a mean of approximately 4 kg of fat and gained approximately 4 kg of lean mass. Similarly, abnormal adipocytokine levels and adiposity were aggravated in women on OC alone and improved in women on OC plus flutamide-metformin; within 9 months, the latter subgroup lost a mean of approximately 3 kg of fat and gained approximately 3 kg of lean mass, in comparison to women on OC alone. In conclusion, young and nonobese PCOS patients were found to be in a low-grade, chronic inflammation state, and to have a body adiposity that evolves according to the balance of circulating adipocytokines and lipids, rather than to androgen excess or fasting hyperinsulinemia. Monotherapy with ethinylestradiol-drospirenone may not be a prime choice for PCOS, given its inefficacy to attenuate abnormal adipocytokine levels and body adiposity; ethinylestradiol-drospirenone plus flutamide-metformin, however, is a first OC combination that was found capable of reverting both the adipocytokine balance and the body composition toward normal, and that may therefore improve the long-term cardiovascular perspectives of women with PCOS.

N2  - We compared the efficacy of spironolactone (50 mg/d) with metformin (1000 mg/d) after random allocation in 82 adolescent and young women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) on body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, menstrual cyclicity, hirsutism, hormonal levels, glycemia, and insulin sensitivity at baseline and at the 3rd and 6th months of treatment. Sixty-nine women who completed the follow-up had a mean age of 22.6 +/- 5.0 yr and mean BMI of 26.8 +/- 4.0 kg/m2. The number of menstrual cycles in the spironolactone and metformin groups increased from 6.6 +/- 2.1 and 5.7 +/- 2.3 at baseline to 9.0 +/- 1.9 and 7.4 +/- 2.6 at 3rd month and to 10.2 +/- 1.9 and 9.1 +/- 2.0/ year at the 6th month (P = 0.0037), respectively. The hirsutism score decreased from 12.9 +/- 3.2 and 12.5 +/- 4.9 at baseline to 10.1 +/- 3.1 and 11.4 +/- 4.1 at the 3rd month and to 8.7 +/- 1.9 and 10.0 +/- 3.3 at the 6th month, respectively. Both groups showed improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, although the metformin effect was significant in the latter. Serum LH/FSH and testosterone decreased in both groups. BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and blood pressure did not change with either drug. We conclude that both drugs are effective in the management of PCOS. Spironolactone appears better than metformin in the treatment of hirsutism, menstrual cycle frequency, and hormonal derangements and is associated with fewer adverse events.

N2  - Aims: Was metformin during pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) associated with pre-eclampsia, and was it safe for mother and neonate? Methods: In the current study, pre-eclampsia and other pregnancy outcomes were prospectively studied in 90 women with PCOS who conceived on metformin 1.5-2.55 g/day, and had >= 1 live birth (97 pregnancies, 100 live births) compared with 252 healthy women (not known to have PCOS) with >= 1 live birth, consecutively delivered in a community obstetrics practice. Result(s): Women with PCOS were older than controls (33 +/- 5 vs. 29 +/- 6 years, P < 0.0001), more likely to be > 35 years old at conception (23 vs. 13%, P = 0.028), much heavier (93 +/- 23 vs. 72 +/- 18 kg, P < 0.0001, BMI 33.8 +/- 7.8 kg/m2 vs. 25.6 +/- 5.9, P < 0.0001), and more likely to be Caucasian (97 vs. 90%, P = 0.05), but there were similar numbers with preconception Type 2 diabetes mellitus [2/90 (2.2%) vs. 1/252 (0.4%), P = 0.17]. Pre-eclampsia in PCOS (5/97 pregnancies, 5.2%), did not differ (P = 0.5) from controls (9/252, 3.6%), nor did it differ (P = 1.0) inPCOS vs. control primigravidas [2/45 (4.4%) vs. 4/91 (4.4%)]. Development of gestational diabetes in PCOS did not differ from controls [9/95 pregnancies (9.5%) vs. 40/251 (15.9%), P = 0.12]. Of the 100 live births to 90 women with PCOS, there were no major birth defects. Mean +/- SD birth weight of the 80 live births >= 37 weeks gestation in women with PCOS (3414 +/- 486 g) did not differ from controls' 206 live births >= 37 weeks (3481 +/- 555 g), P = 0.34, nor did the percentage of >= 37 week gestation neonates >= 4000 g (12.5 vs. 17.5%, P = 0.3) or >= 4500 g (1.3 vs. 2.9%, P = 0.7). Conclusion(s): Metformin is not associated with pre-eclampsia in pregnancy in women with PCOS, and appears to be safe for mother and fetus.

N2  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and the pregnancy outcomes in Asian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), The retrospective cohort study was performed to compare pregnancy outcomes of 47 pregnancies in 41 PCOS women with 264 pregnancies in 222 women with normal menstruation. Logistic regression was used to assess the risk of PCOS on GDM, hypertensive disorder in pregnancy (HDP) and premature delivery. The mean age of both groups was 31 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) and proportion of BMI of > 25 kg/m2 were significantly higher in the PCOS than in the control group. There was no difference in the prevalence of GDM between the PCOS women and the high-risk group of the controls. The prevalence of HDP and premature delivery was significantly greater in PCOS women (21.3 and 13.3%) than in the controls (6. 4 and 5.4%), respectively. PCOS was demonstrated as a risk factor for GDM and HDP with borderline statistical significance, but not for premature birth. The Cesarean section rate was higher in the PCOS than in the control group. In conclusion, the prevalence of GDM in Asian women with PCOS is high and comparable to those of a high-risk group.

N2  - To determine whether insulin-sensitizing drugs would improve ovulation and T levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), without clinical or biochemical criteria indicating insulin resistance and whether the combination of two distinct insulin-sensitizing drugs would be of any benefit over either drug alone. Randomized controlled double-blind trial. A referral center in Caracas, Venezuela. One hundred twenty-eight nonobese PCOS women with normal indices of insulin sensitivity - that is, normal glucose tolerance, fasting insulin, peak insulin during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and fasting glucose-to-insulin ratio. Twenty-eight women were lost to follow-up initially and did not receive any intervention. One hundred women received twice daily one of the following for 6 months: metformin (850 mg), rosiglitazone (4 mg), combination of both drugs, or at least one placebo. Frequencies of ovulation and serum free T after 6 months. Frequencies of ovulation were higher after treatment with an insulin-sensitizing drug (ovulations per subject in 6 months: metformin, 3.3; rosiglitazone, 2.4; and combination, 3.4) than with placebo (0.4). Ovulatory frequencies increased significantly more with metformin than rosiglitazone, and the combination was not more potent. After treatment, serum free-T levels were comparable among all active treatment groups (metformin: 2.34 pg/mL, rosiglitazone: 3.06 pg/mL, and combination: 2.39 pg/mL) and were significantly lower than in the placebo group (7.26 pg/mL). Compared with placebo, fasting insulin levels, area under the insulin curve during OGTT, the homeostatic model assessment of insulin sensitivity, and OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity index improved significantly after metformin or combination therapies but not after rosiglitazone. These findings suggest that insulin-sensitizing drugs increase ovulatory frequency and ameliorate hyperandrogenemia, even in nonobese women with PCOS who appear to have normal insulin sensitivity. © 2004 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinaemia and obesity play a key and coordinating roles in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), contributing in different ways to the clinical expression of the syndrome. Weight loss is beneficial, but the additional administration of insulin-lowering drugs, such as metformin, and antiandrogens may produce further benefits, due to their different spectrum of action. The effects of long-term metformin and flutamide, an antiandrogen drug, added alone or in combination with a low-calorie diet, on body weight and fat distribution, androgens, metabolic parameters and clinical status in obese women with PCOS were investigated. METHOD(S): Forty obese women with PCOS were enrolled in the study. After a 1-month diet, according to single-blind design, the patients were allocated to treatment with placebo, metformin (850 mg/orally, twice daily), flutamide (250 mg/orally, twice daily) or metformin (850 mg/orally, twice daily) + flutamide (250 mg/orally, twice daily) for the following 6 months, while continuing hypocaloric dieting. At baseline and at the end of the study, sex hormone, SHBG, lipid, insulin and insulin sensitivity determinations were evaluated. At the same time, clinical parameters such as anthropometry, total (TAT), visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue, hirsutism and menses were also measured. RESULT(S): We found that, in obese PCOS women, following a hypocaloric diet the addition of metformin, flutamide or the combined metformin + flutamide treatment had some specific additional favourable effects with respect to the low-calorie diet alone. In particular, flutamide treatment seemed to add a significant effect in decreasing visceral fat, androstenedione, DHEA-S, total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and in improving hirsutism. Conversely, metformin had significant benefits on the menstrual status. The two drugs showed an additive effect in reducing testosterone concentrations and a synergistic effect in increasing high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and SHBG levels. Improvement of insulin sensitivity and hyperinsulinaemia appeared to depend on hypocaloric diet, without any further significant effect of the pharmacological treatments, either alone or in combination. CONCLUSION(S): We conclude that, in obese PCOS women, following a hypocaloric diet the addition of metformin, flutamide or the combined metformin + flutamide treatment appears to have a more favourable outcome on body fat distribution, androgens, lipids, hirsutism and menses. However, our data emphasize the dominant role of hypocaloric dieting in improving insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia. Therefore, this study provides a rationale for specifically targeting different therapeutical options for PCOS according to the required outcomes.

N2  - Objective: To determine the clinical, hormonal, and biochemical effects of metformin therapy in obese and nonobese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Controlled clinical study. Setting(s): Department of Gynecology of Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Patient(s): Twenty-nine patients with PCOS. Intervention(s): Patients were treated with 500 mg of p.o. metformin t.i.d. for 6 months. Main Outcome Measure(s): Clinical data as well as serum concentrations of sex steroids, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), gonadotropins, leptin, GH, lipids, insulin, and glucose levels were assessed before and after treatment. Result(s): In the metformin group of nonobese patients, the mean fasting serum insulin concentration decreased from a pretreatment value of 12.1 +/- 2.4 to 6.3 +/- 0.6 muU/mL after treatment, and the area under the curve of insulin decreased from 5,189.1 +/- 517.4 to 3,035.6 +/- 208.9 muU/mL per minute. Also in the metformin group of nonobese patients, the mean basal serum total testosterone, free testosterone, and androstenedione concentrations decreased by 38%, 58%, and 30%, respectively. In the obese patients treated with metformin, only free testosterone showed a statistically significant decrease (1.7 +/- 0.2). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that nonobese patients respond better than obese patients to a 1.5 g/day metformin regimen. © 2004 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Hirsutism is a common and distressing symptom frequently encountered in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), who also show relative insulin resistance. The aim of this trial, in which hirsutism was the primary end point, was to compare the efficacy of the oral antihyperglycemic medication metformin with that of an established treatment, combined ethinyl estradiol and cyproterone acetate. Patients (n = 52) were randomized to receive either metformin (500 mg, three times daily) or Dianette (ethinyl estradiol, 35 mu; cyproterone acetate, 2 mg) treatment for 12 months, with assessments before treatment, at 6 months, and at 12 months. Both objective and subjective methods of evaluating hirsutism were used, and in addition, patient perceptions were examined. The results show that metformin is potentially an effective treatment for moderate to severe hirsutism in women with PCOS. They also suggest that in some respects (Ferriman-Gallwey score and patient self-assessment), it is more efficacious than the standard treatment (Dianette). The objective evaluation of hair diameter reduction showed that both treatments were moderately effective at multiple anatomical sites. Dianette treatment was responsible for profound suppression of androgen activity, in contrast to metformin, which induced negligible change. However, metformin did reduce markers of insulin resistance. The data suggest that hirsutism may be effectively treated by reducing hyperinsulinemia.

N2  - There is still some controversy concerning the effects of metformin in the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). The aim of this study was to asses the effect of metformin on clinical, metabolic and hormone parameters in obese women with PCOS. Thirty obese, non-diabetic women with PCOS received 500 mg of metformin or placebo, TID, over 90 days. Assessed parameters included body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, FSH, LH, total testosterone, SHBG, fasting insulinemia, insulin-to-glucose ratio, total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and menstrual cycles before and after the use of the drugs. Before treatment, patients did not differ in the two groups. After 90 days of metformin use, PCOS women presented significantly lower levels of total testosterone (p = 0.030) and total cholesterol (p = 0.023) compared to the women that used placebo. The other parameters did not differ between the groups. In conclusion, obese women with PCOS may benefit from the use of metformin through the reduction of hyperandrogenemia, total cholesterol, and possibly by restoration of regular menstrual cycles. Further studies with longer follow-ups are necessary to determine cardiovascular and endometrial metformin benefits and insulin-resistance decrease in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the impact of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) on glucose tolerance during pregnancy and perinatal outcome. Method(s): Pregnancy records of 38 PCOS patients were compared retrospectively with 136 non-PCOS patients randomly. Patients with glucose challenge tests values of >130 mg/dl were referred for the 3-h, 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Result(s): A family history of diabetes mellitus, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), gestational weight gain was significantly higher in PCOS patients than controls. The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was similar in both groups. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) was observed in 18.4% of PCOS patients vs. 5.1% of controls. The main predictor of GDM was found pre-pregnancy BMI >25 while main predictor of IGT was found as PCOS. Mean gestational age at delivery, prevalence of preterm labor, modes of delivery, mean birthweight, mean Apgar score at 5 min, proportion of babies admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were similar in both groups. Conclusion(s): Higher IGT prevalence in PCOS patients might be related to maternal obesity and excess gestational weight gain and does not affect perinatal outcome. © 2003 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of sibutramine therapy alone and in combination with ethinyl estradiol-cyproterone acetate (EE-CPA) on the clinical and metabolic parameters of obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Prospective randomized, controlled study. Setting(s): Endocrinology and gynecology clinics. Patient(s): Forty obese women with PCOS. Intervention(s): Group 1 was treated with oral EE-CPA (35 mug-2 mg/day), group 2 with oral sibutramine (10 mg/day), and group 3 with a combination of EE-CPA plus sibutramine for 6 months. All groups were advised to consume a diet of 1,200 kcal/day. Main Outcome Measure(s): Measurements were performed before and 6 months after treatment of body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism score, total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose and insulin during oral glucose tolerance test, and insulin sensitivity index; area under the curve for glucose and insulin were obtained from OGTT. Result(s): Body mass index, Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism score, serum total testosterone, free testosterone, and DHEAS levels were significantly decreased and SHBG was significantly increased in all groups at the end of the study. WHR, diastolic blood pressure, and serum triglyceride level were significantly reduced only in the sibutramine group. Conclusion(s): Sibutramine might have a positive effect on hyperandrogenemia, and clinical and metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease in obese women with PCOS. © 2003 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Metformin, an insulin-sensitizing drug, has been shown to improve ovarian function and glucose metabolism in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but its effects and possible benefits in nonobese PCOS subjects are not well known. Seventeen nonobese (body mass index < 25 kg/m2) women with PCOS were randomized to receive either metformin (500 mg twice daily for 3 months, then 1000 mg twice daily for 3 months; n = 8) or ethinyl estradiol (EE, 35 mug)-cyproterone acetate (CA, 2 mg) oral contraceptive pills (EE-CA; n = 9). Waist to hip ratio; serum concentrations of sex steroids, glucose, and insulin during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test; early phase insulin and C-peptide secretion; and insulin sensitivity using a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp were assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months of treatment. Metformin did not have any effect on glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity, but fasting insulin concentrations decreased from 44.4 +/- 5.1 (SE) to 29.8 +/- 4.3 pmol/liter (P = 0.03), the waist to hip ratio decreased from 0.78 +/- 0.01 to 0.75 +/- 0.01 (P = 0.01), and hepatic insulin clearance increased during the treatment. Furthermore, metformin decreased serum testosterone levels from 2.7 +/- 0.3 to 2.0 +/- 0.2 nmol/liter (P = 0.01) and improved menstrual cyclicity. EE-CA did not have any significant effect on glucose tolerance, serum insulin levels, or insulin sensitivity, but it increased slightly the body mass index (P = 0.09) and significantly serum leptin concentrations (P < 0.001) and decreased serum testosterone levels from 2.1 +/- 0.2 to 1.4 +/- 0.2 nmol/liter (P = 0.03). In conclusion, EE-CA seems to be an efficient mode of therapy for hyperandrogenic symptoms associated with PCOS, but its possible negative effects on insulin and glucose metabolism also have to be taken into consideration in nonobese subjects. Metformin improved hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinemia, and menstrual cyclicity, most likely through its positive effect on insulin clearance and abdominal adiposity. Thus, similarly to obese PCOS women, nonobese PCOS subjects with anovulation may also benefit from metformin treatment.

N2  - Low-grade chronic inflammation, reflected in elevated levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), has recently been linked to obesity, insulin resistance syndromes such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Because the insulin sensitizer metformin has been shown to improve metabolic disturbances in PCOS, it was of particular interest to examine serum CRP levels during metformin therapy. Twenty nonobese women [body mass index (BMI) <= 25 kg/m2] and 32 obese women (BMI >= 27 kg/m2) with PCOS were randomized to receive either metformin (500 mg twice daily for 3 months, then 1000 mg twice daily for 3 months) or ethinyl estradiol (35 mug)-cyproterone acetate (2 mg) oral contraceptive pills. The serum concentrations of CRP were significantly higher in obese than in nonobese subjects at baseline [4.08 +/- 0.53 (SE) vs. 1.31 +/- 0. 28 mg/liter; P < 0.001] and correlated to BMI and to a lesser extent waist-hip ratio, suggesting that the elevated CRP levels may be related to obesity and not only to PCOS itself. During metformin treatment, serum CRP levels decreased significantly from 3.08 +/- 0.7 mg/liter to 1.52 +/- 0.26 mg/liter at 6 months in the whole study population (P = 0.006) and especially in obese subjects. In contrast, the treatment with ethinyl estradiol-cyproterone acetate increased serum CRP levels from 2.91 +/- 0. 68 mg/liter to 4.58 +/- 0.84 mg/liter (P < 0.001). Whether this effect is related to estrogen action in the liver or whether it reflects increased inflammation process and possible risks for cardiovascular disease remains unclear. The decrease of serum CRP levels during metformin therapy is in accordance with the known beneficial metabolic effects of this drug and suggests that CRP or other inflammation parameters could be used as markers of treatment efficiency in women with PCOS.

N2  - Objective: To determine whether the administration of D-chiro-inositol, a putative insulin- sensitizing drug, would affect the concentration of circulating insulin, the levels of serum androgens, and the frequency of ovulation in lean women with the polycystic ovary syndrome. Method(s): In 20 lean women (body mass index, 20.0 to 24.4 kg/m2) who had the polycystic ovary syndrome, treatment was initiated with either 600 Mg of D-chiro-inositol or placebo orally once daily for 6 to 8 weeks. We performed oral glucose tolerance tests and measured serum sex steroids before and after therapy. To monitor for ovulation, we determined serum progesterone concentrations weekly. Result(s): In the 10 women given D-chiro-inositol, the mean (+/- standard error) area under the plasma insulin curve after oral administration of glucose decreased significantly from 8,343 +/- 1,149 muU/mL per min to 5,335 +/- 1,792 muU/mL per min in comparison with no significant change in the placebo group (P = 0.03 for difference between groups). Concomitantly, the serum free testosterone concentration decreased by 73% from 0.83 +/- 0.11 ng/dL to 0.22 +/- 0.03 ng/dL, a significant change in comparison with essentially no change in the placebo group (P = 0.01). Six of the 10 women (60%) in the D-chiro-inositol group ovulated in comparison with 2 of the 10 women (20%) in the placebo group (P = 0. 17). Systolic (P = 0.002) and diastolic (P = 0.001) blood pressures, as well as plasma triglyceride concentrations (P = 0.001), decreased significantly in the D-chiro-inositol group in comparison with the placebo group, in which these variables either increased (blood pressure) or decreased minimally (triglycerides). Conclusion(s): We conclude that, in lean women with the polycystic ovary syndrome, D-chiro-inositot reduces circulating insulin, decreases serum androgens, and ameliorates some of the metabolic abnormalities (increased blood pressure and hypertriglyceridemia) of syndrome X.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the peripheral serum androgen concentrations in normal and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) women during pregnancy, in order to establish if PCOS may induce gestational hyperandrogenism and therefore constitute a potential source of androgen excess for the fetus. Method(s): Twenty pregnant PCOS (PPCOS) women and 26 normal pregnant (NP) women of similar age with singleton pregnancies were selected for the study. During gestational weeks 10-16 and 22-28, a 2 h, 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. For the OGTT, glucose and insulin were measured in each sample and testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), estradiol, progesterone and sex hormone-binding globulin were determined in the fasting sample. Result(s): In the first study period (gestational weeks 10-16), the levels of androstenedione, testosterone and DHEAS and the free androgen index tended to be higher in the PCOS group. These differences became significant in the second study period (gestational weeks 22-28). In this second period, 2 h insulin concentrations were also significantly higher in PPCOS than in NP women. Conclusion(s): The present study demonstrates a significant increase in androgen concentrations during pregnancy in PCOS women. We propose that these androgen concentrations could provide a potential source of androgen excess for the fetus, without leading to fetal virilization.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: Metformin, an insulin-sensitizing agent, has been used successfully as the first-line drug to induce ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. There are, however, very few studies evaluating metformin treatment in women with clomiphene citrate (CC)-resistant polycystic ovaries (PCO). Method(s): Twenty infertile Chinese women aged <40 years, who had ultrasound features of PCO and remained anovulatory on CC, were randomized by computer using the sealed envelope method to receive placebo or metformin 500 mg three times a day for 3 months. Hormonal and metabolic profiles were determined before the therapy and were repeated after 3 months for women who failed to become pregnant within this period. Clomiphene was then added for one cycle to those women who did not ovulate after taking placebo or metformin alone. Result(s): The median ovulation rate in the placebo group was 0% (range: 0-50%) after placebo only and 6.9% (range: 0-50%) after placebo and CC, whereas the corresponding rates in the metformin group were 0% (range: 0-22%) and 0% (range: 0-22%) respectively. There was no improvement in the ovulation rate despite a significant reduction of body mass index, serum testosterone and fasting leptin concentrations in the metformin group. Conclusion(s): Metformin treatment may result in successful ovulation only in certain subgroups of these women.

N2  - Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) often have insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia and may therefore be at an increased risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Hyperinsulinaemia may also be associated with pre-eclampsia. Information concerning outcome of pregnancies in PCOS women is scanty and somewhat controversial. Therefore, 99 pregnancies were retrospectively evaluated in women with PCOS and the findings were compared with an unselected control population. The average body mass index (BMI) in PCOS patients was greater than that in controls (25.6 versus 23.0) (P < 0.0001), and PCOS patients were more often nulliparous than controls (76 versus 42%) (P < 0.001). The multiple pregnancy rate was 9.1% in PCOS patients and 1.1% in controls [odds ratio (OR) 9.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5-23.3]. GDM developed in 20% of the PCOS patients and in 8.9% of the controls (P < 0.001). After logistic regression analysis, BMI >25 seemed to be the greatest predictor for GDM (adjusted OR 5.1; CI 3.2-8.3), while PCOS remained as another independent predictor (adjusted OR 1.9; CI 1.0-3.5). In contrast, PCOS was not a significant predictor for pre-eclampsia, which was merely associated with nulliparity. Premature delivery (16.1% in PCOS and 6.5% in controls) was explained to a large extent by multiple pregnancies and marginally by nulliparity and PCOS. In singleton pregnancies, there was no difference in birth weights, Apgar scores or perinatal morbidity of infants. In conclusion, PCOS slightly increases the risk for GDM, but does not have an important effect on the rate of premature delivery and pre-eclampsia.

N2  - Background: Oral contraceptive pills (OC) are usually the first choice of treatment for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), when fertility is not desired. However, they do not improve, or may even further induce impairment of insulin sensitivity, which is already impaired in women with PCOS. In this prospective, randomized study, we analysed the additional benefits of adding metformin to the OC treatment in non-obese women with PCOS. Method(s): After a baseline work-up including body mass index (BMI), waist:hip ratio (WHR), Ferriman-Gallwey score, ovarian volume, serum gonadotrophin, androgen and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, and fasting lipid, glucose and insulin levels, 40 non-obese women with PCOS were assigned either to the OC or to the OC + metformin treatment by computer-assisted randomization. At the end of the 4 month follow-up period, subjects were re-evaluated. Result(s): The two groups were similar at baseline. After treatment, women in the OC + metformin group had significant decreases in BMI and WHR, and as significant increase in insulin sensitivity, in contrast to those in the OC group, who had insignificant changes in these parameters. Adding metformin also caused significant improvements in serum androstenedione and SHBG levels compared with the OC treatment alone. Conclusion(s): Adding metformin to the OC treatment may improve the insulin sensitivity, and may further suppress the hyperandrogenaemia in non-obese women with PCOS.

T1  - Polycystic ovarian syndrome and the risk of spontaneous abortion following assisted reproductive technology treatment

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: A high proportion of infertile patients have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) with a reportedly greater risk of spontaneous abortion. Because of the close link between PCOS and obesity and the independent association of obesity with poor pregnancy outcomes, it is important to distinguish the possible confounding effect of body mass index (BMI) or other variables from that of PCOS. This study aims to determine the effect of PCOS status on the risk of spontaneous abortion with adjustment for body mass and several other confounding factors in a large cohort of pregnant infertile women. Method(s): The patients (n = 1018) were treated in a tertiary infertility centre. Their PCOS status was determined by standard criteria and their BMI had been taken less than 1 year before the pregnancy. Patients whose PCOS status or BMI measurements were not assessed were excluded. Student's t-test or XX2 test were used to test the difference between the PCOS and non-PCOS groups while a multivariate logistical regression model was used to assess the effect of PCOS, BMI and other confounding factors. Result(s): Overall, the incidence of PCOS was 37% in this cohort. The overall incidence of spontaneous abortion in the study population was 21%. Univariate analysis showed that women with PCOS had a significantly greater risk of spontaneous abortion compared with non-PCOS women (25 versus 18%, P < 0.01). However, using multivariate logistic regression analysis this effect was reduced to a non-significant level [odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85-1.36] after adjusting for obesity and patients/treatment combination factor, and to nil after adjusting for all confounding factors considered in this study (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.75-1.28). Conclusion(s): The results of this study suggest that the higher risk of spontaneous abortion observed in women with PCOS is likely to be due to their high prevalence of obesity and the type of treatment they receive.

N2  - Objective: To compare the effects of cyproterone acetate and desogestrel, as part of combined oral contraceptives, on lipid metabolism and hirsutism of adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Prospective randomized clinical trial. Setting(s): Outpatient gynecology clinic (referral center) of a university. Patient(s): Twenty-eight adolescent girls with clinical and biological hyperandrogenism and six or less menses during the past 12 months. Intervention(s): Group A (n = 14) received 0.15 mg of desogestrel plus 0.030 mg of ethinyl estradiol daily. Group B (n = 14) received 2 mg of cyproterone acetate plus 0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol daily. Treatment was given for 21 days followed by a 7-day rest for a period of 12 months. Main Outcome Measure(s): Hirsutism and lipid profile were evaluated before initiation and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment. Androgen profile was evaluated before and at 12 months of treatment. Result(s): A significant decline of the Ferriman-Gallway hirsutism score was observed from the sixth month of therapy in both groups. During therapy, the levels of testosterone, free testosterone, DELTA4-androstenedione, and 17OH-progesterone decreased significantly, whereas sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) increased significantly in both groups. The level of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increased significantly, whereas high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I increased significantly from the third month of therapy in both groups. Total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratios remained unchanged. The levels of triglycerides increased significantly in the cyproterone acetate-treated group after the third month. Conclusion(s): Treatment of adolescent girls with PCOS with the two studied formulations is comparably effective in decreasing hirsutism and androgen levels. Both combined oral contraceptives are associated with an increase of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol levels and no change of the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratios. Treatment with the cyproterone acetate combined oral contraceptive is associated with a tendency toward increasing the levels of triglycerides. © 2002 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - The aim of the study was to determine the risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH)/pre-eclampsia in a cohort of pregnant women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and known insulin sensitivity status. Pregnancies and neonatal outcome were recorded in a prospective cohort study comprising 29 non-insulin-resistant PCOS women, 23 insulin-resistant PCOS women and a control group of 355 women who had conceived after assisted reproduction. Hypertension, pre-eclampsia and GDM were recorded as well as pregnancy duration, method of delivery and birth weight. The frequency of hypertension was significantly elevated in PCOS women (11.5%) compared to controls (0.3%), p < 0.01. However, the frequency of pre-eclampsia was significantly elevated only in the insulin resistant PCOS women (13.5%) compared to controls (7.0%), p < 0.02. GDM was significantly more frequent in PCOS women (7.7%) than controls (0.6%), p < 0.01. Insulin resistance prior to pregnancy, determined by continuous infusion of glucose with model assessment (CIGMA) test, did not further increase the frequency of GDM. Newborns from PCOS pregnancies were significantly more often delivered by Caesarean section than controls (40.3 vs. 27.3%, p < 0.05) and transferred to neonatal intensive care unit more often than controls (19.2 vs. 9.0%, p < 0.01). Thus we show that the frequencies of pre-eclampsia and GDM are increased in PCOS pregnancies. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive disorder characterised by insulin resistance and often associated with hirsutism. Insulin sensitising agents, such as metformin, improve both the biochemical and reproductive parameters; however, no study has been designed to specifically assess the effect of metformin on hair growth. Design and patients: Sixteen women with PCOS and hirsutism were enrolled into a 14 month (two 6 month phases with a 2 month washout) double-blind placebo-controlled cross over study. Measurements: Hirsutism was assessed using the Ferriman and Gallwey (F-G) score, patient self-assessment and growth velocity. Weight, height and waist-hip ratio were recorded. Gonadotrophins, androgens, plasma glucose and lipids were also measured. Result(s): Ten women completed the full 14 month study. There was a significant improvement in hirsutism at the end of the metformin phase compared with placebo: F-G score 15.8+/-1.4 vs 17.5+/-1.2 (P = 0.025) and patient self-assessment 2.4+/-0.1 vs 3.3+/-0.3 (P = 0.014). Growth velocity, in millimetres per day at the end of each phase also improved (0.67+/-0.17 vs 0.77+/-0.11; P = 0.03). There was a non-significant improvement in both sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and free androgen index (FAI), although there was a significant difference between baseline and metformin treatment for SHBG (P = 0.023) and FAI (P = 0.036). Metformin treatment also reduced weight significantly (91.5+/-7.6 vs 94.0+/-9.8 kg; P = 0.009) and led to a significant improvement in cycle frequency (0.53+/-0.12 vs 0.35+/-0.08 cycles per month; P = 0.008). Conclusion(s): We have demonstrated that metformin treatment in a group of women with PCOS results in a clinically and statistically significant improvement in hair growth compared with placebo.

T1  - Ovarian function and metabolic factors in women with oligomenorrhea treated with metformin in a randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial

N2  - Women with oligomenorrhea and polycystic ovaries show a high incidence of ovulation failure perhaps linked to insulin resistance and related metabolic features. A number of reports show that the biguanide metformin improves ovarian function. However, in these trials the quality of evidence supporting ovulation is suboptimal, and few studies have been placebo-controlled. The aim of our study was to use a double-blind, placebo-controlled approach with detailed assessment of ovarian activity (two blood samples per week) to assess the validity of this therapeutic approach in this group of women. Of the 94 patients randomized, 2 withdrew before treatment commenced, 47 received placebo, and 45 received metformin (850 mg, twice a day). The numbers discontinuing the study prematurely were higher in the treatment group (n = 15) than the placebo group (n = 5; P < 0.05). The ovulation frequency assessed by the ratio of luteal phase weeks to observation weeks was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the treated group (23%) compared with the placebo (13%), and the time to first ovulation was significantly (P < 0.05) shorter [23.6 d; 95% confidence interval (CI), 17, 30; compared with 41.8 d; 95% CI, 28, 56]. The proportion of patients failing to ovulate during the placebo-treatment period was higher (P < 0.05) in the placebo group, and the majority of ovulations were characterized by normal progesterone concentrations in both groups. The effect of metformin on follicular maturation was rapid, because the E2 circulating concentration increased over the first week of treatment only in the metformin group. Significant (P < 0.01) weight loss (and leptin reduction) was recorded in the metformin group, whereas the placebo group actually increased weight (P < 0.05). A significant increase in circulating high-density lipoprotein was observed only in the metformin-treated group. Metabolic risk factor benefits of metformin treatment were not observed in the morbidly obese subgroup of patients (body mass index > 37). No change in fasting glucose concentrations, fasting insulin, or insulin responses to glucose challenge was recorded after 14-wk metformin or placebo therapy. There was an inverse relationship between body mass and treatment efficacy. We show in a large randomized placebo-controlled trial that metformin treatment improves ovulation frequency in women with abnormal ovarian function and polycystic ovaries significantly but to a modest degree, and protracted treatment improves cardiovascular risk factors. These data support a beneficial effect of metformin in improving ovarian function in women with oligomenorrhea and polycystic ovaries.

N2  - Abdominal obesity and hyperinsulinemia play a key role in the development of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Dietary-induced weight loss and the administration of insulin-lowering drugs, such as metformin, are usually followed by improved hyperandrogenism and related clinical abnormalities. This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of combined hypocaloric diet and metformin on body weight, fat distribution, the glucose-insulin system, and hormones in a group of 20 obese PCOS women [body mass index (BMI) > 28 kg/m2] with the abdominal phenotype (waist to hip ratio >0.80), and an appropriate control group of 20 obese women who were comparable for age and pattern of body fat distribution but without PCOS. At baseline, we measured sex hormone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and leptin blood concentrations and performed an oral glucose tolerance test and computerized tomography (CT) at the L4-L5 level, to measure sc adipose tissue area (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue area. All women were then given a low-calorie diet (1200-1400 kcal/day) alone for one month, after which anthropometric parameters and CT scan were newly measured. While continuing dietary treatment, PCOS women and obese controls were subsequently placed, in a random order, on metformin (850 mg/os, twice daily) (12 and 8, respectively) or placebo (8 and 12, respectively), according to a double-blind design, for the following 6 months. Blood tests and the CT scan were performed in each woman at the end of the study while they were still on treatment. During the treatment period, 3 women of the control group (all treated with placebo) were excluded because of noncompliance; and 2 PCOS women, both treated with metformin, were also excluded because they became pregnant. Therefore, the women cohort available for final statistical analysis included 18 PCOS (10 treated with metformin and 8 with placebo) and 17 control women (8 treated with metformin and 9 with placebo). The treatment was well tolerated. In the PCOS group, metformin therapy improved hirsutism and menstrual cycles significantly more than placebo. Baseline anthropometric and CT parameters were similar in all groups. Hypocaloric dieting for 1 month similarly reduced BMI values and the waist circumference in both PCOS and control groups, without any significant effect on CT scan parameters. In both PCOS and control women, however, metformin treatment reduced body weight and BMI significantly more than placebo. Changes in the waist-to-hip ratio values were similar in PCOS women and controls, regardless of pharmacological treatment. Metformin treatment significantly decreased SAT values in both PCOS and control groups, although only in the latter group were SAT changes significantly greater than those observed during the placebo treatment. On the contrary, visceral adipose tissue area values significantly decreased during metformin treatment in both PCOS and control groups, but only in the former was the effect of metformin treatment significantly higher than that of placebo. Fasting insulin significantly decreased in both PCOS women and controls, regardless of treatment, whereas glucose-stimulated insulin significantly decreased only in PCOS women and controls treated with metformin. Neither metformin or placebo significantly modified the levels of LH, FSH, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, and progesterone in any group, whereas testosterone concentrations decreased only in PCOS women treated with metformin. SHBG concentrations remained unchanged in all PCOS women; whereas in the control group, they significantly increased after both metformin and placebo. Leptin levels decreased only during metformin treatment in both PCOS and control groups. In summary, this study shows that, in PCOS women with abdominal obesity, long-term treatment with metformin added to hypocaloric diet induced, in comparison with placebo, a greater reduction of body weight and abdominal fat, particularly the visceral depots, and a more consistent decrease of serum insulin, testosterone, and leptin concentrations. These changes were associated with a more significant improvement of hirsutism and menses abnormalities. Moreover, the effects on body weight, insulin, and leptin were similar to those observed in the group of comparable abdominally obese controls, in whom, however, a more pronounced reduction of sc fat in the abdominal region and an increase of SHBG concentrations were found. These findings, therefore, indicate that hyperinsulinemia and abdominal obesity may have complementary effects in the pathogenesis of PCOS.

N2  - Objective: To compare the clinical efficacy of an original combined therapy with cyproterone acetate, 2 mg, and ethinylestradiol, 35 mug (Diane 35), plus finasteride (5 mg) for 2 weeks per month with that of Diane 35 alone in hirsute women. Design(s): Prospective randomized, single-blinded study. Setting(s): Outpatients in an academic research environment. Patient(s): Fifty women with idiopathic hirsutism (IH) or the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Intervention(s): Group 1 (n = 25) received Diane 35 alone and group 2 (n = 25) received Diane 35 plus finasteride. The latter drug was administered using a new therapeutic scheme: 14 consecutive days for each therapeutic cycle. Main Outcome Measure(s): Hormonal evaluation was done before beginning treatment and after 3 and 6 months of therapy. Hirsutism was graded at 3-month intervals. Result(s): The combination of Diane 35 plus finasteride for 14 days significantly decreased the hirsutism score after 3 months of therapy, while Diane 35 alone induced this effect after 6 months. Conclusion(s): Finasteride in combination with Diane 35 for 14 days is effective, well accepted, and safe in hirsute patients, as the amount of antiandrogenic drugs administered is much lower than that in conventional treatment.

N2  - Our aims were: 1. To investigate if women with PCOS who become pregnant using gonadotrophins have a higher incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared to spontaneously pregnant matched control women, 2. To compare the prevalence of GDM in PCOS women with that in women with hypo/eugonadotrophic hypogonadism and in unexplained infertility and 3. To investigate differences in pregnancy outcomes between the groups. This was a retrospective case-control study. Women with PCOS were matched with a control by age, BMI, and ethnicity. There were 60 women with PCOS, II with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, 6 with eugonadotrophic hypogonadism, and 12 with unexplained infertility: Control women were those who attended a major public hospital for antenatal care and delivery. We found no difference in the prevalence of GDM between the PCOS (22%) and the controls (17%) or between the PCOS and other groups. Women with GDM (diet or insulin controlled) had a significantly higher BMI than women without GDM (p = 0.019). There was no difference in pregnancy outcomes between the groups. There was a significant dependence of babies' birthweight on mother's BMI (p < 0.001).

T1  - Polycystic ovary disease and the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension
A1  - Kashyap S.
A1  - Claman P. 
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension in patients with and without polycystic ovary disease (PCOD). STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective, case-control analysis of patients who achieved singleton pregnancies with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) therapy. Twenty-two PCOD patients were compared to 27 infertility patients without PCOD who were pregnant after hMG therapy. Non-PCOD patients received hMG for superovulation as part of superovulation/intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization/embryo transfer. PCOD patients were receiving hMG for simple ovulation induction. Pregnancy-induced hypertension was defined as late pregnancy blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg on two readings six hours apart and return to normal blood pressure by four to six weeks postpartum. RESULT(S): There were no differences between PCOD and non-PCOD patients with reference to age, body mass index, parity or other pregnancy-induced hypertension risk factors (i.e., chronic hypertension, diabetes or chronic renal disease). Pregnant PCOD patients had a much higher incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension, 31.8% (7/22), versus non-PCOD patients, who only had a pregnancy-induced hypertension incidence of 3.7% (1/27) (P = .016, OR = 12.1, 95% CI= 1.3-566.8). CONCLUSION(S): PCOD patients are at very high risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension when pregnant after ovulation induction.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the androgen-suppressing effect of spironolactone, and the use of this drug as a single agent in the long-term therapy of hirsute patients with either polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or idiopathic hirsutism (IH). Standard cyproterone acetate (CPA) treatment was used to evaluate the results obtained with spironolactone. DESIGN: Prospective randomized study. PATIENTS: Forty-six hirsute women were separated randomly into two groups, stratified for polycystic ovary syndrome. For 12 months, Group 1 (21 patients, 10 PCOS) received spironolactone only (200 mg/day). Group 2 (23 patients, nine PCOS) received CPA (50 mg/day) with ethinyl oestradiol (35 mug/day). MEASUREMENTS: Ferriman-Gallwey clinical score for hirsutism and serum testosterone, androstenedione, and LH levels. RESULT(S): In IH patients, hirsutism regressed equally with spironolactone (21 +/- 2-14.5 +/- 2) and CPA (23 +/- 2-13 +/- 2). In PCOS patients, the mean score for hirsutism after 12 months was significantly lower with CPA (12 +/- 1) than with spironolactone (16 +/- 1). Testosterone levels did not change with spironolactone; with CPA there was a decrease from baseline in PCOS (47% and 51%, 6 and 12 months) and IH patients (31% and 30%). Androstenedione levels also declined from baseline in CPA-treated PCOS patients (38% and 39%, 6 and 12 months). Androgen levels were significantly different between the groups after 6 and 12 months. LH levels decreased with CPA (72%) but not with spironolactone. CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest that spironolactone used as a single agent is as effective as cyproterone acetate combined with oestradiol for long-term treatment of patients with idiopathic hirsutism. In PCOS patients, spironolactone is still effective for reducing hirsutism; however, for treatment of the hormonal or metabolic manifestations associated with PCOS, it may be necessary to combine spironolactone with either an antigonadotrophic agent or a drug that improves peripheral insulin sensitivity.

N2  - Metformin, a biguanide antihyperglycemic drug, has been shown to improve ovarian function and glucose metabolism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but results concerning its effects on insulin sensitivity are controversial. Oral contraceptive pills are commonly used in the treatment of PCOS; but, like metformin, their influence on insulin sensitivity is not well known. We randomized 32 obese (body mass index > 27 kg/m2) women with PCOS, either to metformin (500 mg x 2 daily for 3 months, then 1000 mg x 2 daily for 3 months) or to ethinyl estradiol (35 mug)-cyproterone acetate (2 mg) oral contraceptive pills (Diane Nova) for 6 months. Metformin significantly decreased the waist-to-hip ratio, serum testosterone, fasting free fatty acid, and insulin concentrations and improved oxidative glucose utilization and menstrual cyclicity, with slight (but nonsignificant) improvements in insulin hepatic extraction and insulin sensitivity. Diane Nova significantly decreased serum testosterone and increased serum sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations and glucose area under the curve during oral glucose tolerance test. It is concluded that metformin, probably by way of its effect on adipose tissue, leads to reduction of hyperinsulinemia and concomitant improvement in the menstrual pattern; and therefore, it offers a useful alternative treatment for obese, anovulatory women with PCOS. Despite slight worsening of glucose tolerance, Diane Nova is an efficient treatment for women with hyperandrogenism and hirsutism.

N2  - Objective: To study whether there is an increased risk of glucose intolerance and hypertensive complications during pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and if there is an adverse pregnancy outcome. Method(s): In a retrospective case-control study, pregnancies and neonatal outcome were compared in 33 women with PCOS and 66 women without PCOS. The women were treated at Huddinge University Hospital; antenatal care was given at associated outpatient units. Main Outcome Measure(s): Blood glucose and blood pressure during the different trimesters. Pregnancy outcome in terms of gestational length, birth weight, and need for neonatal intensive care. Result(s): No significant differences were found in blood glucose levels between the groups. There were also no differences in blood pressure during the first and second trimester. However, during the third trimester and labor, the PCOS group had a significantly higher blood pressure than the control group. Apart from a tendency toward reduced growth of twins in PCOS mothers, the babies were healthy, overall, with few problems in the neonatal period. Conclusion(s): No major differences with regard to perinatal outcome in pregnant women with and without PCOS were found. An increased risk of hypertensive disorders in the third trimester and during labor was demonstrated in the PCOS group. This suggests that in the antenatal care of women with PCOS, attention should focus on blood pressure in order to reduce the risks of morbidity associated with hypertension.

N2  - Background: Women with the polycystic ovary syndrome have insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, possibly because of a deficiency of a D- chiro-inositol-containing phosphoglycan that mediates the action of insulin. We hypothesized that the administration of D-chiro-inositol would replenish stores of the mediator and improve insulin sensitivity. Method(s): We measured steroids in serum and performed oral glucose-tolerance tests before and after the oral administration of 1200 mg of D-chiro-inositol or placebo once daily for six to eight weeks in 44 obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome. The serum progesterone concentration was measured weekly to monitor for ovulation. Result(s): In the 22 women given D-chiro-inositol, the mean (+/-SD) area under the plasma insulin curve after the oral administration of glucose decreased from 13,417+/-11,572 to 5158+/-6714 muU per milliliter per minute (81+/-69 to 31+/-40 nmol per liter per minute) (P=0.007; P=0.07 for the comparison of this change with the change in the placebo group); glucose tolerance did not change significantly. The serum free testosterone concentration in these 22 women decreased from 1.1+/-0.8 to 0.5+/-0.5 ng per deciliter (38+/-28 to 17+/-17 pmol per liter) (P=0.006 for the comparison with the change in the placebo group). The women's diastolic and systolic blood pressure decreased by 4 mm Hg (P<0.001 and P=0.05, respectively, for the comparisons with the changes in the placebo group), and their plasma triglyceride concentrations decreased from 184+/-88 to 110+/-61 mg per deciliter (2.1+/-0.2 to 1.2+/-0.1 mmol per liter) (P=0.002 for the comparison with the change in the placebo group). None of these variables changed appreciably in the placebo group. Nineteen of the 22 women who received D- chiro-inositol ovulated, as compared with 6 of the 22 women in the placebo group (P<0.001). Conclusion(s): D-Chiro-inositol increases the action of insulin in patients with the polycystic ovary syndrome, thereby improving ovulatory function and decreasing serum androgen concentrations, blood pressure, and plasma triglyceride concentrations.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the complications and outcome of pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary disease (PCOD). STUDY DESIGN: The course and outcome of 47 singleton pregnancies in women with well-documented PCOD were compared with those in 100 healthy controls. RESULT(S): Women with PCOD had a significantly higher body mass index as compared to the control group (P < .05); however, the proportion of lean versus obese subjects in the two groups was similar. The incidence of an abnormal glucose challenge test, gestational diabetes mellitus and pregnancy-induced hypertension was significantly increased in pregnant women with PCOD (P< .05). When lean PCOD subjects were compared with lean control subjects, the difference in the incidence of the above complications was still significant (P < .05). The incidence of pregnancy complications was similar when obese PCOD subjects were compared with obese controls. CONCLUSION(S): Women with PCOD were at increased risk of gestational diabetes and pregnancy-induced hypertension, and this risk appeared to be independent of body mass index.

N2  - Forty-four hirsute patients with polycystic ovary syndrome were randomly treated with finasteride (5 mg daily) or flutamide (250 mg twice daily) for 6 consecutive months. Hirsutism was evaluated before and after therapy with the Ferriman-Gallwey score and with measurement of hair diameter (mum). The hairs were taken from four different body areas: the face, abdomen, thighs and forearm. The measurement was carried out with a micrometer applied to the optical microscope. Mean plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, 17alpha- hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, testosterone, free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, insulin, and sex hormone binding globulin were determined before and after therapy. Hematochemical examinations and side-effects were controlled after the treatment. After 6-months' therapy, both antiandrogens significantly reduced the Ferriman-Gallwey score and hair diameter in all the body areas. Finasteride reduced the Ferriman-Gallwey score by 25% and hair diameter by 16-25%; flutamide reduced the score by 20% and hair diameter by 15.3-22%. Abdominal hairs were more sensitive to both drugs. Flutamide induced a significant drop in total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosteron sulfate. No important side-effect or change in the hematochemical parameters was observed. Our data demonstrate that finasteride and flutamide are effective in the treatment of hirsutism in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.

T1  - Association between polycystic ovary syndrome and glucose intolerance during pregnancy

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - The purpose of our study was to determine if women with polycystic ovary syndrome are more likely than other women with infertility to develop gestational diabetes. All women who were successfully treated for infertility in the reproductive endocrinology clinic at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center from January 1, 1990, to January 1, 1995, were identified. A retrospective cohort study was performed comparing the incidence of gestational diabetes and abnormal diabetic screening tests among subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome (N = 24) and a general infertility control group (N = 44). The incidence of gestational diabetes diagnosed in subjects with a history of polycystic ovary disease was similar to the incidence of gestational diabetes in subjects with infertility not ascribed to polycystic ovary disease (four subjects, 16.7% v. three subjects, 6.7%; relative risk [RR] 2.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-13.57). A greater number of subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome had a positive diabetic screening test compared to the control group (13 subjects, 54% v. 10 subjects, 23%; RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.26-4.71). Our study suggests that women with polycystic ovary syndrome are more likely to have a positive diabetic screening test, but no more likely to have gestational diabetes than other women with infertility.

N2  - Objective: To examine the outcome of treatment with IVF-ET of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) who failed to conceive on conventional treatment. Design(s): Retrospective analysis with an age-matched control group. Setting(s): University hospital infertility clinic and IVF unit. Patients, Interventions: Sixty-eight women with PCOS who had failed to conceive on treatment with clomiphene citrate and during six ovulatory cycles on gonadotropins underwent 208 cycles of IVF-ET. An age-matched group of 68 women with a tubal mechanical factor who received 143 treatment cycles during the same period served as controls. Main Outcome Measure(s): Cumulative conception rates, the cumulative livebirth rates, and IVF-ET data were compared between the two groups. Results of treatment with and without GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) within the groups were also compared. Result(s): A comparison of PCOS and mechanical factor (control) groups showed almost identical results at 6 months for cumulative conception rate (82% versus 85%) and cumulative livebirth rate (69% versus 65%). Significantly more oocytes were retrieved but a smaller percentage fertilized in PCOS, and the pregnancy rate per ET did not differ between the two groups (23% versus 26%). Treatment with GnRH-a and gonadotropins as opposed to gonadotropins alone improved the cumulative conception rate, miscarriage rate, and cumulative livebirth rate in the PCOS but not in the control group and improved fertilization rates in both groups. Conclusion(s): For patients with PCOS who fail to conceive with gonadotropin treatment, IVF-ET is a successful treatment alternative, producing results equal to those for women with a mechanical tubal factor. Better results were achieved with GnRH-a in women with PCOS but made no difference to those with a mechanical tubal factor compared with treatment with gonadotropins alone.

N2  - Objective: To assess the outcome of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) in women with refractory polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Design(s): Retrospective case series with an age-matched control group. Setting(s): Ovulation induction and IVF programs in a tertiary referral center. Patients and Interventions: Nine patients with PCOS who failed standard ovulation induction treatment (clomiphene citrate plus >=6 ovulatory human menopausal gonadotropin [hMG] cycles) underwent 19 cycles of IVF-ET. Forty age-matched tubal factor patients who completed 40 cycles of IVF-ET served as a control group. Outcome Measures: Demographic features and IVF-ET cycle characteristics were compared using Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test. Result(s): Cycles of IVF-ET in patients with PCOS were associated with higher estradiol levels (5,222 versus 4,009 pmol/L), lower hMG requirements (15.8 versus 19.6 vials), greater numbers of oocytes (7.6 versus 5.6), and lower fertilization rates (56% versus 75%) compared with tubal factor cycles (P < 0.05). However, the number of embryos transferred (3.9 versus 4.0) and the clinical pregnancy rate per embryo transfer (24% versus 25%) did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that conception failure after six or more ovulatory hMG cycles in patients with PCOS does not adversely affect subsequent IVF performance.

N2  - Since patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) commonly have insulin resistance, albeit with normal glucose tolerance, we evaluated glucose tolerance in PCOS patients exposed to the diabetogenic effect of pregnancy. The clinical material was obtained from two centers, in Springfield, Illinois (22 patients), and New York, New York (31 patients), and the results were compared with a control population with 2,306 consecutive general pregnancies. There were no differences between PCOS patients from the two centers in regard to age or ponderal index (P > .1). A review of the medical records showed that the incidence of gestational diabetes in the PCOS patients was 7.5%, similar (P > .1) to the 6.6% frequency of gestational diabetes in the controls. The overall incidence of neonatal macrosomia (birth weight > 4,000 g) was 7% (4 of 57) among infants born to PCOS women. That was similar to the 12.4% incidence of neonatal macrosomia among infants born to women with normal glucose tolerance and to the 14.5% incidence among infants born to women with gestational diabetes. Preexisting PCOS does not appear to increase the risk of developing gestational diabetes or neonatal macrosomia.

N2  - The incidence of glucose intolerance in 76 patients with polycystic ovary disease (PCOD) who became pregnant after treatment for ovulation was compared with that in 95 healthy women, matched with respect to age and diabetic background, who conceived without intervention. The incidence of abnormal glucose tolerance test results in the treated group was twice that in the normal group (19.7% vs. 9.5%; P < .03). Moreover, within the treated group abnormal test results occurred more frequently in patients who became pregnant following induction of ovulation with human menopausal gonadotropin (29%) than in those who conceived as a result of other treatment modalities (12%).

Y1  - 1982//
N2  - The incidence of preeclamptic toxemia (PET) was investigated in 72 anovulatory, oligomenorrheic and previously nulliparous women who conceived after an induction of ovulation. One-thousand consecutive spontaneous pregnancies and 1,000 pregnancies of primiparae were used as control groups. The anovulatory group consisted of 33 consecutive well-documented cases of polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) and 39 anovulatory patients in whom PCO was excluded (A-NPCO). The results indicate that pregnancies after induction of ovulation are accompanied with a higher incidence of PET. The rate of this disorder was significantly higher in PCO groups than in A-NPCO women (28.5 vs. 4%), when calculated per number of all pregnancies. The difference between the incidence of PET in PCO, A-NPCO, control primiparae and normal control patients was even more pronounced when calculated on the basis of the number of patients (54.5, 12.5, 11 and 2.5%, respectively). Overproduction of steroid hormones, especially androgens, was suggested as the main factor for the appearance of PET in PCO patients.
