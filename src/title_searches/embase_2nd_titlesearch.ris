N2  - Objective. To evaluate nutritional intake, energy expenditure, and segmental body composition in lean women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and compare them with age- and body mass index- (BMI-) matched control women. Methods. 32 nonobese patients with PCOS and 31 age- and BMI-matched healthy women were included in the study. Energy expenditure and physical activity level were assessed by metabolic Holter equipment (SenseWear Armband, SWA) which was never previously used in lean PCOS population. Food intake is recorded with 24 hours of food record. Segmental body composition analysis was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analyses (BIA). Results. Mean BMI was 22.64 +/- 3.64 and 21.55 +/- 2.77 kg/m2 (p=0.185) in PCOS and control groups, respectively. Mean age was 22.03 +/- 4.21 and 21.71 +/- 2.67 year (p=0.720), respectively. No significant differences were found in total energy intake and percentage of carbohydrates, fats, and other micronutrients (p>0.05). Energy percentage of proteins (%12.73 +/- 1.98, p=0.008) was statistically lower in subjects versus the control group. The measurements of physical activity duration (PAD) (1.40 +/- 0.87/2.18 +/- 0.99 hours, p=0.002), active energy expenditure (372.35 +/- 198.32/494.10 +/- 186.50 kcal, p=0.018), and step counting (9370.03 +/- 3587.49/11730.90 +/- 3564.31 steps, p=0.013) measurement of the PCOS group were lower than the control group, respectively. Conclusions. New diagnosed women with PCOS had similar distribution and quantity of body fat parameters and nutritional status when compared to healthy women. Control subjects were found more active in energy expenditure.Copyright © 2020 Gulcan Arusoglu.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most prevalent endocrine diseases affecting women of reproductive age. The pathogeny of PCOS is still not completely understood, but one contributing factor that has been proposed is anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH). There is currently no clear correlation between levels of AMH and incidence of PCOS in Saudi Arabian patients. The goal of this study was to determine the threshold of AMH and correlate it with PCOS clinical features to facilitate a proper diagnosis for PCOS. In this case-control study, we recruited 79 PCOS women and 69 normal ovulatory women; PCOS patients were diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criterion. On days 2-4 of the menstrual cycle, transvaginal/abdominal ultrasound was performed and serum levels of AMH, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured for all participants. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to determine the AMH diagnostic cut-off at 3.19 ng/mL, with 72% sensitivity and 70% specificity; AMH > 3.19 ng/mL was significantly correlated with PCOS. HighAMHlevels were correlated with age at menarche, polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM), and oligo/amenorrhea. Serum AMH is a promising diagnostic marker of ovarian dysfunction in PCOS patients especially in cases in which the evaluation of PCOM was complicated.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) as a known complication in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) may occur following inducible fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and can affect the sequels of these treatments. Objective(s): This study aimed to assess the effects of OHSS on pregnancy outcomes through IVF in women with PCOS. Also, we assessed the value of baseline sexual hormones to predict the pregnancy's success. Material(s) and Method(s): This case-control study was conducted on 180 consecutive women suffering from PCOS who were candidates for IVF at Fatemieh hospital in Hamadan, Iran, from May-July 2022. The women were assigned to the case group (with OHSS, n = 129) and the control group (without OHSS, n = 51). Measuring the sexual hormones was performed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent technique. Result(s): In the multivariable logistic regression model, OHSS could not predict the likelihood of clinical or chemical pregnancy following IVF. None of the baseline sexual hormones could predict the successful chemical or clinical pregnancy in PCOS women following IVF. Conclusion(s): OHSS may not influence IVF-related outcomes in PCOS women. The values of sexual hormones may not also determine the pointed outcome.Copyright © Pilehvari et al.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: What are the predictive factors for later development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Obesity and abdominal fat distribution in women with PCOS in the mid-fertile years were the major risk factors for T2DM development 24 years later when lifestyle factors were similar to controls. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Women with PCOS have an increased prevalence of T2DM. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A longitudinal and cross-sectional study was performed. Women with PCOS were examined in 1992 and in 2016. Randomly selected, age-matched women from the general population served as controls. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women with PCOS (n = 27), attending an outpatient clinical at a tertiary care centre for infertility or hirsutism were diagnosed in 1992 (mean age 30 years) and re-examined in 2016 (mean age 52 years). Women from the World Health Organization MONItoring of trends and determinants for CArdiovascular disease (WHO MONICA-GOT) 2008, aged 38-68 years, served as controls (n = 94), and they were previously examined in 1995. At both at baseline and at follow-up, women had blood samples taken, underwent a clinical examination and completed structured questionnaires, and the women with PCOS also underwent a glucose clamp test at baseline. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: None of women with PCOS had T2DM at baseline. At the 24-year follow-up, 19% of women with PCOS had T2DM versus 1% of controls (P < 0.01). All women with PCOS who developed T2DM were obese and had waist-hip ratio (WHR) >0.85 at baseline. No difference was seen between women with PCOS and controls regarding use of high-fat diet, Mediterranean diet or amount of physical activity at follow-up at peri/postmenopausal age. However, women with PCOS had a lower usage of a high-sugar diet as compared to controls (P = 0.01). The mean increases in BMI and WHR per year were similar in women with PCOS and controls during the follow-up period. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The small sample size of women with PCOS and the fact that they were recruited due to infertility or hirsutism make generalization to women with milder forms of PCOS uncertain. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Obesity and abdominal fat distribution, but not hyperandrogenism per se, in women with PCOS in the mid-fertile years were the major risk factors for T2DM development 24 years later when peri/postmenopausal. Lifestyle factors were similar to controls at that time. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was financed by grants from the Swedish state under the agreement between the Swedish government and the country councils, the ALF-agreement (ALFGBG-718611), the Gothenburg Medical Association GLS 694291 and 780821, the Swedish Heart Lung Foundation and Hjalmar Svensson Foundation.

N2  - This study aimed to analyze the depressive and anxiety states of adolescent girls with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This was a cross-sectional, multicenter, case-control study. A total of 100 participants (PCOS group, 51; control group, 49) aged 13-18 yr were included in the study. Body mass index was higher in patients with PCOS (P = 0.002). In the PCOS group, 28.5% of the patients had moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms, whereas the incidence was lower in controls (8.3%, P = 0.021). The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-State, STAI-Trait, and physical, psychosocial, and total Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory PedsQL scores were higher in the PCOS group, suggesting that anxiety was more common and the quality of life was worse in patients with PCOS than in healthy participants (P = 0.01, P = 0.03, P = 0.02, P = 0.046, and P = 0.047, respectively). The serum free testosterone (fT) levels were positively correlated with the depression and anxiety scores and negatively correlated with the psychosocial PedsQL scores. In conclusion, adolescent girls diagnosed with PCOS demonstrated higher depressive and anxiety symptoms and lower psychosocial quality of life scores than their healthy counterparts. A relationship was found between the fT level and all psychological measures.Copyright © 2022 by The Japanese Society for Pediatric Endocrinology.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) share similar clinical and psychosocial features. We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of IBS in women with PCOS, and its relationship with obesity, metabolic and hormonal profiles, as well as sleep and psychiatric disorders. Subjects/Methods: This is a cross-sectional case-control study of 431 untreated women with PCOS and 259 healthy volunteers. All participants were assessed with a comprehensive clinical evaluation and two questionnaires: the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and the Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5). IBS was diagnosed using the Rome III criteria. Obesity was defined as a BMI >=30 kg/m2. Anthropometric measurements, metabolic, hormonal profiles, and psychosocial morbidities were compared. Result(s): Women with PCOS were more likely to have IBS (10.7% vs 5.8%, p=0.029) and obesity (29% vs 4%, p<0.001) than healthy volunteers. Mixed-type IBS (IBS-M) was the most common subtype (74%) among patients with PCOS and IBS. There was a higher prevalence of psychiatric morbidities (total BSRS-5 score >=10) in women with PCOS than in healthy women (11.4% vs 3.5%, p<0.001). Women with PCOS and IBS were more likely to have sleep difficulties (67.4% vs 30.9%, p<0.001) and psychiatric morbidities (21.7% vs 10.1%, p=0.019) than those without IBS. Anthropometrics, metabolic and hormonal profiles were similar between PCOS women with and without IBS. Among women with PCOS, those with both IBS and obesity had the highest risk of developing sleep difficulties (odds ratio: 5.91; 95% confidence interval: 1.77-19.77) and psychiatric distress (odds ratio: 4.39; 95% confidence interval: 1.26-15.29) than those without. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS have increased IBS, obesity, sleep and psychiatric disturbances. The presence of IBS in PCOS women is associated with sleep and psychiatric disorders. The coexistence of obesity and IBS exacerbates sleep difficulties and psychiatric distress. Screening and management of IBS and obesity might be warranted to improve sleep and psychiatric disturbances in women with PCOS.Copyright © 2021 Tseng, Chiu, Tu, Wu, Ho and Chen.

N2  - Context: Altered satiety hormones in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) may contribute to obesity. Diets with a low glycemic load (GL) may influence appetite-regulating hormones including glucagon and ghrelin. Objective(s): To test the hypothesis that following a 4-week, eucaloric low vs high GL diet habituation, a low vs high GL meal will increase glucagon and decrease ghrelin to reflect greater satiety and improve self-reported fullness. Method(s): Secondary analysis of a randomized crossover trial. Participant(s): Thirty women diagnosed with PCOS. Intervention(s): Participants were provided low (41:19:40% energy from carbohydrate:protein:fat) and high (55:18:27) GL diets for 8 weeks each. At each diet midpoint, a solid meal test was administered to examine postprandial ghrelin, glucagon, glucose, insulin, and self-reported appetite scores. Result(s): After 4 weeks, fasting glucagon was greater with the low vs high GL diet (P =. 035), and higher fasting glucagon was associated with lesser feelings of hunger (P =. 009). Significant diet effects indicate 4-hour glucagon was higher (P <. 001) and ghrelin was lower (P =. 009) after the low vs high GL meal. A trending time x diet interaction (P =. 077) indicates feelings of fullness were greater in the early postprandial phase after the high GL meal, but no differences were observed the late postprandial phase. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest after low GL diet habituation, a low GL meal reduces ghrelin and increases glucagon in women with PCOS. Further research is needed to determine the influence of diet composition on ad libitum intake in women with PCOS.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - Objective: To describe the lipidomic characteristics of offspring born to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women (PCOS-off) and assess the associations between differential lipids and clinical phenotypes. Method(s): Ultra performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were performed on plasma samples from 70 PCOS-off and 71 healthy controls. The associations of differential metabolites with clinical phenotypes were examined by multiple linear regression. Result(s): Forty-four metabolites were significantly altered in PCOS-off, including 8 increased and 36 decreased. After stratification according to sex, 44 metabolites (13 increased and 31 decreased) were expressed differently in girls born to PCOS women (PCOS-g), most of which were glycerolipids. Furthermore, 46 metabolites (9 increased and 35 decreased) were expressed differently in boys born to PCOS women (PCOS-b), most of which were glycerophospholipids. Significant associations of metabolites with weight Z-score and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were found in PCOS-off. Triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were separately correlated with some lipids in PCOS-g and PCOS-b. Conclusion(s): PCOS-off showed specific lipid profile alterations. The abnormal level of glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelin indicated the risk of glucose metabolism and cardiovascular diseases in PCOS-off. Some lipids, such as phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, may be the potential markers. The results broadened our understanding of PCOS-offs' cardiometabolic status and emphasized more specific and detailed monitoring and management in this population.© Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Liu, Lv, Zhang, Hu, Li, Ma, Cui and Zhao.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to examine sexual function and its correlates among infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in comparison with their non-PCOS counterparts. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case-control study, 209 infertile women (116 PCOS and 93 non-PCOS) from Tehran, Iran, were evaluated in February and March 2018. Female sexual function index (FSFI), hormonal status, and documented reports of hyperandrogenic manifestations of the patients were investigated. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 32.00 +/- 5.00 years old. Eighty-four (40.2%) patients including 42.2% of the PCOS patients and 37.6% of the non-PCOS cases (P>0.05), were suspected of female sexual dysfunction (FSD). The most impaired functions in both groups were desire and arousal. Sexual function was not significantly different between the groups. However, PCOS women had more orgasm problems and acne worsened their sexual function. Total FSFI was positively associated with prolactin level but negatively associated with central obesity in the non-PCOS group; it was negatively correlated with marital duration in the PCOS group. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and pain, prolactin level and lubrication, and central obesity and arousal were correlated in the non-PCOS women. Prolactin level and orgasm, marital duration and arousal, and marital duration and the total FSFI were correlated in the PCOS women. Conclusion(s): Sexual function was similarly low in infertile PCOS and non-PCOS women. However, orgasm problems and the negative effect of acne varied between the two groups. Further investigations may target how hormonal profile may affect sexual function. Practitioners should scrutinize the specific impaired sexual domains and their correlated conditions in PCOS women, notably orgasm, acne, and prolactin level. Interventions should be well tailored based on particular needs of infertile PCOS women.Copyright © 2021, Royan Institute (ACECR). All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive disorder with prevalence of 5-10% in premenopausal women, which is identified with hyperandrogenism and ovarian dysfunction. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of fennel supplementation with energy-restricted diets on body fat and muscle percentage and insulin resistance in women with PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-four overweight/obese women with PCOS were randomly allocated to 4 groups for 12 wk as follows: (1) standard diet + fennel (SDF), (2) high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet supplemented with fennel (HPF), (3) standard diet + placebo (SDP), and (4) high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet + placebo (HPP). Result(s): After 12 wk of intervention, there were significant changes in the percentage of body fat and muscle in all groups. Decreasing in fasting insulin was -4.12 m IU/ml (p = 0.01) or HPF n -4.5 m IU/ml (p = 0.03) for SDP groups. In addition, HOMA-IR significantly decreased in HPF (p = 0.02) and SDP (p = 0.02) groups. Conclusion(s): Energy-restricted diets independent of dietary composition improved the body fat and muscle percentage and insulin resistance indices in women with PCOS. High-protein diet and fennel compared with standard diet and placebo had no significant effect on insulin resistance, body fat and muscle.

N2  - Study question: To describe lipidomic characteristics of offspring born to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS-off ) women and assess the associations of clinical phenotypes changes with differential lipids. Summary answer: PCOS-off showed specific changes in lipidomics and some differential lipids (e.g., phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) may be the potential markers of aberrant cardiometabolic health. What is known already: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most prevalent endocrine disorder characterized by ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovarian morphology, affects about 8-13% of women of fertile age. Aberrant metabolic pathophysiological changes and increased pregnancy complications associated with PCOS predispose PCOS patients to have suboptimal intrauterine environments and that may produce a detrimental impact on the cardiometabolic health of their children. Study design, size, duration: A total of 141 blood plasma samples from 70 children born to PCOS women (43 girls, 27 boys) and 71 healthy control children (44 girls, 27 boys) were obtained for lipidomics. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Blood samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm, 4degreeC for 20 min, and the upper plasma was collected and used for lipid extraction. Then the waters ACQUITY UPLC I-Class system and The Xevo G2-S Q-TOF with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source (Waters, Manchester, UK) was used for chromatographic analysis and mass spectrometry analysis separately. Main results and the role of chance: In total, 44 metabolites were found to be significantly altered in PCOS-off, including 8 up-regulated and 36 down-regulated metabolites. After stratified by sex, 44 metabolites were found to express differently in girls born to PCOS women (PCOS-g). 13 metabolites were up-regulated, and 31 metabolites were down-regulated, most of which belong to glycerolipids species. While 46 metabolites were found to express differently in boys born to PCOS women (PCOS-b) with 9 increased metabolites and 35 decreased ones, most of which were glycerophospholipids metabolites. Additionally, significant associations between metabolites changes and weight Z-score as well as high density lipoprotein level were found in PCOS-off. In PCOS-g, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein level were found to be correlated with some metabolites, whereas in PCOS-b, thyroid stimulating hormone and high density lipoprotein were correlated with some lipids. Limitations, reasons for caution: Other species of metabolites except lipids are not included in this study. Besides, some potential confounding maternal factors, such as smoking, drinking, breastfeeding etc. were not included due to the lack of data. Wider implications of the findings: The results had broadened our understanding of PCOS-off 's cardiometabolic status and emphasized monitor and special management in this susceptible group of population.

N2  - Relevance: The clinical picture of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is extremely polymorphic, especially in adolescence. At the same time, the diagnostic criteria of PCOS in adolescence are still under discussion, and the hormonal parameters, including anti-Mullerian hormone range and hyperandrogenism, are not determined. The aim of the present study was to characterize the pivotal clinical and hormonal features of PCOS in adolescents and to establish the age-specific thresholds of the most essential hormonal parameters. Design(s): A case-control study. Method(s): The study included 130 girls with PCOS according to the complete Rotterdam criteria, aged 15 to 17 years. The control group consisted of 30 healthy girls with a regular menstrual cycle of the same age. A complete clinical and laboratory examination, hormonal assays, and ultrasound of the pelvic organs were performed. The serums anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), LH/FSH, prolactin, estradiol, 17alpha-OH progesterone (17alpha-OHP), androstenedione, testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leptin, and free androgen index (FAI) were analyzed. The diagnostic accuracy of AMH, FAI, LH/FSH, T, and androstenedione levels in predicting PCOS in adolescents was established using a logistic regression model and calculating area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Result(s): The serum levels of LH (9.0 (5.4-13.8) vs. 3.7 (2.5-4.7) IU/L; p < 0.0001), LH/FSH (1.6 (1.0-2.3) vs. 0.7 (0.5-1.1); p < 0.0001), 17alpha-OHP (4.1 (3.2-5.1) vs. 3.4 (2.7-3.8) nmol/L; p = 0.0071), cortisol (464.0 +/- 147.6 vs. 284.0 +/- 129.7 nmol/L; p < 0.0001), prolactin (266.0 (175.0-405.0) vs. 189.0 (142.0-269.0) mIU/L; p = 0.0141), T (1.9 (1.2-2.5) vs. 0.8 (0.7-1.1) nmol/L; p < 0.0001), androstenedione (15.8 (11.6-23.2) vs. 8.3 (6.5-10.8) ng/mL; p < 0.0001), AMH (9.5 (7.5-14.9) vs. 5.8 (3.8-6.9) ng/mL; p < 0.0001), FAI (5.5 (2.8-7.0) vs. 1.6 (1.1-2.3); p < 0.0001), SHBG (37.0 (24.7-55.5) vs. 52.9 (39.0-67.6) nmol/L; p = 0.0136), DHEAS (6.8 +/- 3.2 vs. 5.1 +/- 1.5 mumol/L; p = 0.0039), and leptin (38.7 +/- 27.1 vs. 23.7 +/- 14.0 ng/mL; p = 0.0178) were significantly altered in the PCOS patients compared to the controls. Multivariate analysis of all studied hormonal and instrumental parameters of PCOS in adolescents revealed as the most essential: AMH level > 7.20 ng/mL, FAI > 2.75, androstenedione > 11.45 ng/mL, total T > 1.15 nmol/L, LH/FSH ratio > 1.23, and the volume of each ovary > 10.70 cm3 (for each criterion sensitivity >= 75.0-93.0%, specificity >= 83.0-93.0%). The diagnostic accuracy of PCOS determination was 90.2-91.6% with the combined use of either four detected indexes, which was significantly higher than the use of each index separately. The accuracy of. PCOS diagnostics reached 92% using AMH and leptin concentrations when the value of the logistic regression function [85.73 - (1.73 x AMH) - (0.12 x Leptin)] was less than 70.72. Conclusion(s): The results of the study estimate the threshold for AMH, FAI, androstenedione, testosterone, LH/FSH, and ovarian volume, which could be suggested for use in the PCOS diagnostics in adolescents with a high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the combination of either four determined indexes improved the diagnostic accuracy for the PCOS detection in adolescents.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

N2  - Background: While polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is often associated with psychological distress, its most frequent clinical characteristics include acne, hirsutism and increased level of androgen hormones. Objective(s): To evaluate the level of depression and anxiety, hirsutism, acne, and level of androgen hormones in PCOS and control group and its association with cognitive function. Material(s) and Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted on 53 women with PCOS and 50 healthy women as a control group. Data were collected using a questionnaire including the samples' demographic information, clinical features, clinical findings of hyperandrogenism, and the Beck Depression and Anxiety questionnaire. In addition, the acne and hirsutism levels of the subjects were evaluated using the global acne grading system and the Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system, respectively. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening test for cognitive impairment that covers major cognitive domains. Result(s): A significant difference was found between the two groups in the mean levels of acne, hirsutism, total testosterone, free androgen index, depression, and anxiety. However, some mean values of the MoCA were lower in the women of case group compared to the control group. Additionally, a significant difference was observed between the two groups in the domains of visual-spatial ability (p = 0.009), executive function (p = 0.05), attention (p = 0.03), and total MoCA scores (p = 0.002). Conclusion(s): The PCOS women demonstrated significantly lower performance on the tests of executive function, attention, and visual-spatial function than the healthy control women.Copyright © Mehrabadi et al.

N2  - Endometrial cancer rates are rising in parallel with the obesity epidemic. We aimed to determine the prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer (EH/EC) bleeding symptoms among at-risk women. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of overweight and obese women at a multidisciplinary weight management center who had completed a gynecologic/menstrual history questionnaire from May 2018 to October 2019. The primary outcome of any EH/EC symptom was defined as follows: in premenopausal women, any recent abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB); in postmenopausal women: any bleeding/discharge. The prevalence of EH/EC symptoms was compared by menopausal status using Fisher's exact tests, and multivariable regression identified independent factors associated with having EH/EC symptoms. A total of 103 women were included, and 4 (4%) had a history of EH/EC. Of the 84 (n = 82%) of women with no prior hysterectomy, 57% (n = 33/58) of premenopausal women reported any EH/EC symptom compared to 15% (n = 15/26) of postmenopausal women (p < 0.001). Two-thirds of symptomatic premenopausal women had two or more symptoms, most commonly heavy menses (49% (n = 25/51)) and irregular periods (39% (n = 17/44)). Sixty percent (n = 20/33) had discussed these with a gynecologist, and one third had undergone an endometrial biopsy. A history of polycystic ovarian syndrome (RR:1.72, 95% CI 1.24-2.38) was associated with EH/EC symptoms, while being postmenopausal was not (RR:0.32, 95%CI: 0.12-0.87). We demonstrate that EH/EC bleeding symptoms are prevalent in this at-risk population, but frequently are not discussed with gynecologists. Providers who care for obese women should ask about EH/EC symptoms, and provide prompt referrals to facilitate prevention and early detection of this cancer.Copyright © 2020

N2  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of different combined oral contraceptive pills and metformin in reducing hirsutism in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE(S): We sought to determine the effects of ethinylestradiol (35g)/cyproterone acetate (2mg) (EE/CPA) and ethinylestradiol (20g)/desogestrel (0.15mg) (EE/DES), alone or with metformin, on hirsutism in PCOS. METHOD(S): A randomized, double-blind, triple-dummy study was conducted on women with PCOS and hirsutism (N=107) who received one of four drug combinations (Arm A: EE/ CPA; Arm B: EE/DES; Arm C: EE/CPA plus metformin; or Arm D: EE/DES plus metformin). Hirsutism was assessed at baseline, six months, and 12 months by using five outcomes variables. RESULT(S): No outcomes variable showed a significant difference between the four arms at 12 months. There was a significant reduction in both hair density and modified Ferriman-Gallwey score (mFGS) in Arm A, mFGS in Arm B, hair density in Arm C, and diameter of sideburn hair in Arm D, respectively. Separately, there was a significant increase noted in the hair growth rate of chin and an improvement in patients perceptions of hirsutism in all four study arms. CONCLUSION(S): EE/CPA and EE/DES were equally effective in improving hirsutism in PCOS, with no added benefit from low-dose metformin.

N2  - Data on eating disorders in women with PCOS is insufficient. The objective of this case study was to examine the hypothesis that women with PCOS exhibit more impaired eating than healthy women. Women diagnosed with PCOS under the 2003 Rotterdam Diagnostic Criteria (n = 40) were compared with a healthy control group (n = 40). The groups also were divided into two as normal body weight and overweight/obese. The Eating Disorders Assessment Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R21), were completed by all participants in order to evaluate eating behaviors in addition to eating disorders. Among the overweight/obese group, the average total and subscale scores of the EDE-Q as well as the total and sub-factor scores of the TFEQ-R21 were higher in women with PCOS compared to controls (p <.05). However, this statistically significant result was not shown among the women with normal weight (p >.05). In comparison to the controls, the PCOS women displayed higher values of the tool scores indicating abnormal restraint eating, body shape concern and weight concern subscale scores (p <.05). This result suggests that the evaluation of eating disorders should be added to routine screening and the monitoring of women with PCOS.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Aims: Metabolic syndrome among PCOS sisters may vary depending on the phenotype. The aim of the present study was to analyze the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among different phenotypes of PCOS sisters. Design(s): Case control study. Material(s) and Method(s): Two hundred sisters of PCOS patients and 99 age matched healthy controls underwent history, clinical examination, biochemical parameters for metabolic syndrome and hormonal assessment. Result(s): Of 200 sisters, 85 were unaffected (UA group), 21 sisters had hyperandrogenemia (HA group), and 94 sisters had irregular periods or hyperandrogenemia. We observed that the frequency of metabolic syndrome among PCOS sisters was comparable to age and weight matched controls (30% vs 27%). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was higher in HA and AFFECTED sisters (around 30% in both) compared to UA sisters (20%). The presence of metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with age, BMI, HOMA-IR and free testosterone. After correction for age and BMI, metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with HOMA-IR (P - 0.05) and free testosterone (P - 0.03). Conclusion(s): Based on above findings, we conclude that affected sisters and those with higher age, BMI and hyperandrogenemia have a high risk of metabolic syndrome compared to unaffected sisters.Copyright © 2019 Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences.

N2  - Background: Sub-inflammation and insulin resistance characterize women with PCOS. Data on dietary modulation of inflammation among PCOS women is scant, particularly from Indian subcontinent. The present study aimed to assess the effect of plant based vs. animal origin diets on serum markers of inflammation (primary outcome measure). Method(s): This observational case-control study compared age and BMI matched PCOS and apparently healthy women from two populations following different dietary practices. The vegetarian women from New-Delhi (n = 82 PCOS and n = 179 healthy) and non-vegetarian women from Srinagar (n = 62 PCOS and n = 141 healthy) formed the groups. Using a uniform methodology, detailed clinical, biochemical, hormonal, and inflammatory marker assessment was undertaken. Result(s): The mean age of the overall cohort was 26.23 +/- 4.59 years with a mean BMI of 24.39 +/- 3.72 kg/m2. Overall pro-inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, hs-CRP and serum resistin) were significantly higher (p <= 0.05) and anti-inflammatory markers (IL-10 and adiponectin) were lower among women with PCOS than healthy subjects. On comparing vegetarian women with non-vegetarians, higher daily calorie intake (1895.46 +/- 258.19 vs. 1860.13 +/- 323.96 Kcal) with a higher protein and fat and lower carbohydrate intake was recorded in the latter, although the percent energy derived from carbohydrates was higher among vegetarians. Clinical and biochemical parameters were comparable among the groups except mFG score, total serum testosterone and serum lipid levels which were higher among non-vegetarian women as compared to their vegetarian counterparts from both categories (PCOS and healthy). Interestingly, vegetarian women with PCOS and healthy women had higher serum pro-inflammatory and lower anti-inflammatory markers compared to their non-vegetarian counterparts. Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS consuming Indian vegetarian diet have higher pro-inflammatory and lower anti-inflammatory marker levels than their age and BMI matched healthy non-vegetarian counterparts. This interesting observation can be attributed to the dietary composition, among other factors and needs confirmation from well-designed randomized studies on a larger cohort. Clinical Trial Registration: The study was registered with CTRI database under registration number CTRI/2013/09/003996.© Copyright © 2019 Ganie, Sahar, Rashid, Wani, Nisar, Sathyapalan, Vishnubhatla, Ramakrishnan, Parvez and Geer.

N2  - Background: Failure to respond adequately to standard protocols and to recruit adequate follicles is called 'poor ovarian response'. The relationships between metabolic alterations and NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 levels were explored in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Method(s): This case-control study involved 20 infertile women with PCOS and 20 control women diagnosed as poor ovarian responders stimulated with a GnRH antagonist. Blood samples were taken during ovum pick-up and follicular fluids (FF) were obtained from a dominant follicle from the subjects. Samples were analyzed by using ELISA. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 20. Data are expressed as means +/- standard deviation (SD). Result(s): Blood NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 levels in PCOS were significantly lower (p= 0.011) while the NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 levels of FF in poor ovarian response (POR) were higher, but not statistically significant. Insulin, total testosterone, fasting glucose, homeostasis model assessment, and insulin resistance index in women with POR decreased when compared with PCOS. Blood NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 levels were significantly higher than FF NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 levels in both groups (p<0.001). Moreover, a positive correlation was detected between blood NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 and testosterone (p=0.602, r=0.304), HOMA-IR (p=0.252, r=0.384), BMI (p=0.880, r= 0.44) in PCOS, but it was not significant. Conclusion(s): NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 levels might be important in follicular growth in PCOS subjects undergoing IVF/ICSI with an antagonist protocol and NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 level could reliably help to predict poor ovarian response.Copyright © 2019 Avicenna Research Institute.

T1  - Establishing an Anti-Mullerian hormone cutoff for diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome in women of reproductive age-bearing Indian ethnicity using the automated Anti-Mullerian hormone assay
A1  - Mahajan N.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosed by Rotterdam criteria, is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. The criteria of polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) are subject to operator variability and technological advances. Serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level has been proposed as a more reliable alternative to antral follicle count. There is a paucity of data on use of AMH for diagnosis of PCOS in Indian women. Aim and Objectives: The aim of this study is to determine a cutoff level for AMH that could facilitate diagnosis of PCOS and its phenotypes in women of Indian origin using the automated (Roche) assay and to compare the competence of oocytes in PCOS and non-PCOS women undergoing in vitro fertilization-intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI). Materials and Methodology: A total of 367 women undergoing treatment at our fertility center between February 2017 and August 2017 were prospectively enrolled in this study. Of these, 133 were diagnosed with PCOS, 69 had isolated PCOM, and 165 (controls) had normal ovaries on ultrasound examination. Serum AMH levels were assessed using the fully automated Roche Elecsys immunoassay. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocol was used for IVF-ICSI in all patients. Statistical Analysis Used: Quantitative variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Qualitative variables were correlated using the Chi-square test. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Result(s): Mean AMH concentrations in women with PCOS was higher (7.56 +/- 4.36 ng/mL) in comparison to PCOM and controls. Serum AMH concentration >5.03 ng/mL could facilitate diagnosis of PCOS (area under the curve = 0.826); sensitivity-70.68%, specificity of 79.91%. There was no difference in the ratio of mature to total oocytes retrieved in the three groups (P > 0.05). Mean number of mature oocytes was lower in controls than PCOS and PCOM (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Serum AMH concentration >5.03 ng/mL could be used as cutoff value for the diagnosis of PCOS in women of Indian origin.Copyright © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

N2  - Background: Infertile females experience some types of distress such as social stress, depression, and sexual dysfunction that may be exacerbated by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The current study aimed at comparing psychological profile of infertile females with PCOS with that of women without PCOS with respect to four domains: infertility stress, depression, sexual dysfunction, and alexithymia. Material(s) and Method(s): The current case-control study was conducted on 240 infertile females (120 with PCOS and 120 without PCOS) in Fatemeh Azahra Infertility and Reproductive Health Research Center (Babol, Iran) from 2016 to 2017. The following questionnaires were used to collect data: the fertility problem inventory (FPI), the female sexual function index (FSFI), the Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-20). Result(s): Females with PCOS had higher FPI total scores than the ones without PCOS (120.68 +/- 29.42 vs. 112.83 +/- 30.94). Of the subscales of infertility stress, the mean scores of social stress and rejection of a future life without a child were higher in females with PCOS than the ones without PCOS (P<0.05). Also, the mean total scores of alexithy-mia symptoms (TAS-20) in females with PCOS were significantly higher than those of the ones without PCOS (59.83 +/- 11.36 vs. 55.69 +/- 11.52). There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the mean scores of depression symptoms and sexual function. Conclusion(s): Infertile females with PCOS experienced higher levels of infertility stress and inability to distinguish and describe their feelings compared with the ones without PCOS. It is suggested that infertility care providers should provide more psychosocial support for infertile females with PCOS.Copyright © 2019, Royan Institute (ACECR). All rights reserved.

T1  - Risk of developing depression and its impact on quality of life in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome - A South Indian scenario
A1  - Mukundan A.
A1  - Jayakumari S. 
Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive endocrine disorders, affecting the patient's psychological functioning and satisfaction with life. Settings and Design: Tertiary care hospital based case-control study was conducted. Material(s) and Method(s): the study was effectuated in 372 patients in total, including an equal number of cases and controls.PHQ-9 was used to determine the depression based DSM-IV directly diagnostic criteria for depression and PCOSQS was used to assess the quality of life. Statistical analysis used: Data was examined using descriptive statistics, spearman co-relation, Chi-square test, and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Result(s): The study shows an increased risk of depression in PCOS (76.96% of cases compared to 20.03% of controls), Odd's ratio 5.95 (95% confidence interval [3.818 to 9.351]) and the depression was found to be having an impact on patient's quality of life. Conclusion(s): The care of individuals with PCOS should include the screening and possible treatment for depression in order to achieve and sustain treatment goals considering the fact that Identifying depression early will further improve the quality of life of PCOS patients and also reduce the overall treatment cost, which are generally unaffordable by most individuals with this disease in India.Copyright © 2019 Society of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Objectives: to compare the serum AMH levels in PCOS & normo-ovulatory women and investigate correlation between clinical, hormonal, ultrasonographic parameters and AMH levels in both groups. Method(s): a comparative cross-sectional study was performed in sixty-four women (32-PCOS based on Rotterdam consensus; 32 normo-ovulatory-matched controls investigated for male, tubal or unexplained infertility). Serum LH, FSH, androstenedione, fastinginsulin and AMH were measured in early phase (day 3-4) of natural menstrual cycle or progestin-induced withdrawal bleeding (in PCOS). Transvaginal USG performed for calculation of small sized ovarian follicles (<10 mm). Result(s): AMH levels were significantly higher in patients of PCOS group as compared to control group (ROC curve; Cut off >3.6; Sensitivity-78.12% & Specificity-87.50%). AMH was positively correlated with LH, LH/FSH, androstenedione and number of small follicles in PCOS group while in control group with number of small follicles only. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that number of small follicles has only determinant for AMH level (r =0.509; P < 0.005). Conclusion(s): number of small sized ovarian follicles has strong association with AMH level in PCOS patients, possibly lead to increased androgen levels. So AMH could be helpful in planning and management for ovulation induction therapy in PCOS patients.Copyright © 2018, Partner-Graf srl, Prato.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is not an easy procedure, as the signs and symptoms are heterogeneous and of undefined aetiology. AIM: This study is aimed to evaluate serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level and luteinizing hormone (LH)/folic stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio in women with PCOS in Sudan and to assess the diagnostic efficiency for the diagnosis of PCOS. METHOD(S): In a case-control study, Serum AMH, LH, FSH was measured in the early follicular phase from Sudanese patients (N = 230) with PCOS and100 controls. The LH/FSH ratio was calculated, and its diagnostic power was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULT(S): The means of serum AMH, serum LH level and LH/FSH ratio of the test, were significantly increased in the test group compared to the control group (P-value < 0.000). The AMH sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) were found to be 83%, 99%, 99%, and 72% respectively. Serum AMH was considered adequate measures for the diagnosis of PCOS; its level showed an area under the ROC curve of 0.98 (95% confidence, P-value < 0.000). The best compromise between 98% specificity and 90% sensitivity was obtained with a cut-off value of 3.3 ng/mL for PCOS diagnosis. There was no correlation between age, body mass index (BMI) and AMH level in the test group. CONCLUSION(S): The Serum AMH level and LH/FSH ratio were higher in patients than in control. However AMH level has better discriminative power and good diagnostic potency for the diagnosis of the PCOS among Sudanese women.Copyright © 2018 Hafza Tola, Mohammed Abbas, Elsir Abu Alhassan, Nassr Eldin Shrif, Mohammed Rida.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Background: The purpose of the study was to determine cut-off values for ovarian volume (OV) and follicle number per ovary (FNPO) in Indian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method(s): Eighty six PCOS women (Rotterdam criteria) and forty five matched ovulatory and normo-androgenic women were recruited. A detailed 2D and 3D transvaginal scan was carried out in early follicular phase (D2-D5) in all patients. Ovarian volume, follicle number per ovary, stromal volume, vascularization index (VI), vascularization flow index (VFI) and flow index (FI) were measured in PCOS and controls. Mann-Whitney test and logistic analysis using PROC LOGISTIC function of SAS (Version 9.3) were used to calculate the best cut-offs for the diagnosis of PCOS. Result(s): Mean ovarian volume was 13.7+/-5.89 and 5.06+/-2.44 (p<0.0001), FNPO was 19.18+/-6.89 and 7.13+/-3.51 (p<0.0001) in PCOS and controls, respectively. The cut-offs for the diagnosis of PCOS were 2D OV=6.15 cm3, 2D FNPO=12. By 3D scan, OV=7 cm3, FNPO=10, stromal volume=6 cm3, VI=4.546, VFI=2.925 and FI= 19.266. Youden's Index (To select optimal predicted probability cut-off) was the highest for 2D FNPO (0.88786). 2D FNPO showed the highest specificity and sensitivity (AUC), 0.95238 and 0.93548, for the diagnostic accuracy of PCOS. Conclusion(s): 2D and 3D trans-vaginal scans are equally accurate for assessment of ovarian morphology. FNPO has better diagnostic accuracy for PCOS compared to ovarian volume. Cut-off for FNPO and OV in Indian PCOS women is 12 and 6.15 cm3 by 2D, 10 and 7 cm3 by 3D trans-vaginal scan.Copyright © 2018 Avicenna Research Institute. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Recent studies have highlighted the role of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in numerous ovarian disorders. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the major causes of infertility in Egypt. Several reports have linked PCOS with vitamin D deficiency. This investigation illustrates the possibility of using serum AMH for PCOS diagnosis in infertile Egyptian females, determines the variables affecting it and correlates it with serum 25(OH)D, testosterone, dyslipidemia and anthropometric parameters. Method(s): All parameters were assessed either with ELISA or colorimetrically in 53 infertile PCOS women and 17 age matched apparently healthy controls diagnosed according to Rotterdam consensus. Result(s): Serum AMH, total testosterone, triacylglycerol (TG) levels and BMI were significantly higher in PCOS group compared to healthy controls (p=0.0239, p=0.0381, p=0.0457, and p=0.0067, respectively), while serum 25(OH)D levels and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) were significantly lower (p=0.0397 and p=0.0443, respectively). No significant correlation existed between AMH and 25(OH) D, BMI and dyslipidemia markers. AMH was found to have a significant negative correlation with age and a highly significant positive one with total testosterone in PCOS group (r=-0.303, p=0.027 and r=0.370, p=0.008, respectively). In the receiver operating characteristic curve of AMH, the cut-off value was 42.63 pmol/L with a specificity of 59% and a sensitivity of 82%. Multivariate regression analysis showed total testosterone to be the only determinant for AMH (beta=0.381 and p=0.038). Conclusion(s): There should be a future trend of using AMH as a diagnostic marker for PCOS in Egyptian females. The variation in serum AMH levels is determined by total testosterone.Copyright © 2018 Engy Bakeer et al., published by Sciendo.

N2  - Background: Despite many effort to identify and control the factors involved in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), there are no available reports indicating the association of healthy eating index (HEI) and PCOS. Objective(s): The present study has been conducted to examine the relationship between HEI and PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case-control study, the study population comprised 297 women aged 20-40 yr referred to Baqiyatallah Hospital Clinics, Tehran, Iran in two groups: case group (n=99) and control group (n=198). The usual dietary data were collected using a validated 168-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Standard anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and waist circumference) were also taken. Unconditional logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between the PCOS and the HEI. Result(s): The mean age and body mass index of case and control groups were 29+/-5.5 vs. 29.5+/-6 yr and 26.6+/-4.8 vs. 26+/-4.2 kg/m2, respectively (p=0.752, p=0.822). Mean HEI scores for the case and control groups were found to be 61 and 65, respectively. In final model and after adjustment for confounders, the prevalence of PCOS in subjects in the highest tertile HEI score was significantly (50%) less than those in the lowest tertile HEI score (OR=0.50; 95% CI: 0.25-0.74, p=0.001). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that HEI score is inversely associated with the risk of PCOS in adult women.Copyright © 2017, Research and Clinical Center for Infertitlity. All rights reserved.

N2  - Aim: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a significant risk factor for premenopausal endometrial cancer (EC) and/or atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH). The aim was to elucidate the clinical background and detailed menstrual history of EC and/or AEH in young women with PCOS. Method(s): From January 2001 to December 2013, women under 35 years of age who had been diagnosed with EC and/or AEH and who had been treated at Kumamoto University Hospital, Japan, were recruited. The patients' clinical characteristics, clinical stages of EC and/or AEH, medication and operation methods, endocrine profiles, and menstrual history were assessed retrospectively. Result(s): Of all the cases of EC and/or AEH, 25 (4.6%) were under 35 years of age. The mean age was 29.0 years and all the patients were nulligravida. The clinical stages of EC and/or AEH that were identified included: AEH (five cases), stage IA (18 cases), IB (one case), and IIIA (one case). Fourteen (56%) cases met the criteria for PCOS. Both the Body Mass Index and Homeostatic Model Assessment-insulin resistance were significantly higher in the patients with PCOS than in the patients without PCOS. Medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy was not effective for the patients with PCOS and they underwent a hysterectomy more often than the patients without PCOS. All the patients with PCOS exhibited irregular menstruation or amenorrhea, the mean duration of which was 13.1 years before PCOS and EC and/or AEH were diagnosed. Conclusion(s): Although both the patients with and without PCOS had irregular menstruation, the patients with PCOS were less likely to have fertility-sparing surgery than the patients without PCOS because they had more advanced disease or failed to respond to medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

N2  - Context: Intrauterine life may be implicated in the origin of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) modifying the endocrine and metabolic functions of children born to PCOS mothers independently of the genetic inheritance and gender. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reproductive and metabolic functions in sons of women with PCOS during puberty. Method(s): Sixty-nine PCOS sons (PCOSs) and 84 control sons of 7-18 years old matched by the Tanner stage score were studied. A complete physical examination was conducted including anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist, hip and body mass index). An oral glucose tolerance test was performed and circulating concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), sex hormone-binding globulin, testosterone, androstenedione (A4), 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and AMH were determined in the fasting sample. Result(s): Waist-to-hip ratio, FSH and androstenedione levels were significantly higher in the PCOSs group compared to control boys during the Tanner stage II-III. In Tanner stages II-III and IV-V, PCOSs showed significantly higher total cholesterol and LDL levels. Propensity score analysis showed that higher LDL levels were attributable to the PCOSs condition and not to other metabolic factors. AMH levels were comparable during all stages. The rest of the parameters were comparable between both groups. Conclusion(s): Sons of women with PCOS show increased total cholesterol and LDL levels during puberty, which may represent latent insulin resistance. Thus, this is a group that should be followed and studied looking for further features of insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk markers. Reproductive markers, on the other hand, are very similar to controls.Copyright © 2017 The authors.

N2  - Background and Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been reported to be associated with the development of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The objective of this meta-analysis is to assess the relationship between PCOS and OSA. Method(s): A literature search was conducted to identify studies linking PCOS with the risk of OSA. Studies in which the presence of OSA was confirmed with overnight polysomnography were included. Random effects models were used to calculate pooled relative risks. Result(s): Eight studies conducted in adults and five studies conducted in adolescents were identified. The pooled OSA prevalence was 0.22 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08-0.40) in PCOS patients. The pooled prevalence of OSA was higher in adults (0.32, 95% CI: 0.13-0.55) than adolescents (0.08, 95% CI: 0.00-0.30). Risk of OSA was significantly increased in adult patients with PCOS (odds ratio (OR) 9.74, 95% CI: 2.76-34.41). Risk of OSA was not significantly increased in adolescents (OR: 4.54, 95% CI:0.56-36.43). Conclusion(s): These findings demonstrate a significant association between PCOS and OSA in adult patients. Considering the increased risk for long-term cardiometabolic disorders associated with both PCOS and OSA, it is important to diagnose and treat OSA in patients with PCOS.Copyright © 2017 The authors.

N2  - Context: Insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may increase the risk of reactive hypoglycaemia (RH) and decrease glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. The possible effects of treatment with oral contraceptives (OCP) and/or metformin on GLP-1 secretion and risk of RH in PCOS is undetermined. Setting(s): Outpatient clinic. Patients and interventions: Randomized, controlled clinical trial. Ninety women with PCOS were randomized to 12-month treatment with OCP (150 mg desogestrel + 30 mg ethinylestradiol), metformin (2 g/day) or metformin + OCP. Five-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (5-h OGTT) measuring fasting and area under the curve (AUC) for GLP-1, glucose, insulin and C-peptide were performed before and after the intervention period. Sixty-five women completed the study and 34 weight-matched healthy women were included as controls. Main Outcome Measure(s): Changes in GLP-1, glucose, insulin and C-peptide during 5-h OGTT. Result(s): Fasting GLP-1 levels increased during metformin + OCP vs OCP treatment, whereas AUC GLP-1 levels were unchanged during medical treatment. The prevalence of reactive hypoglycemia increased from 9/65 to 14/65 after intervention (P < 0.01) and was more common after treatment with metformin + OCP (increase from 3/23 to 6/23, P = 0.01). Reactive hypoglycaemia was associated with higher insulin and C-peptide levels during 5-h OGTT, but was unassociated with BMI and AUC GLP-1. GLP-1 levels were comparable in PCOS vs controls. AUC GLP-1 levels were significantly lower in obese vs lean patients and were inversely associated with BMI. Conclusion(s): AUC GLP-1 levels were unchanged during treatment. Increased risk of hypoglycemia during metformin + OCP could be associated with increased insulin secretion.Copyright © 2017 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.

N2  - Objective: PCOS is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age associated with insulin resistance. Metformin and Myo-inositol being insulin sensitizers improve biochemical parameters. This study was done to compare the effects of these drugs on biochemical profile in PCOS. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective, open labeled, randomized, comparative, clinical study was conducted on 60 patients. The patients were randomly divided in two groups of 30 each to receive either of the following two treatments: Group A: Tab Myo-inositol 1g twice daily & Group B: Tab Metformin 500 mg thrice daily for 24 weeks. Biochemical profile was assessed by measuring fasting blood sugar, insulin levels & calculating glucose/insulin ratio and homeostatic model assessment- insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index at baseline and subsequently at the end of 12 & 24 weeks. Serum Lipid profile was also assessed. Result(s): In both the groups, there was statistically significant improvement in insulin resistance. In group A & group B, the values for glucose/ insulin ratio improved from 6.77+/-0.99 to 7.87+/-1.03 and 5.5+/-0.42 to 6.90+/-0.47 respectively at the end of 24 weeks. HOMA-IR values decreased from 4.18+/-0.4 to 2.88+/-0.27 & 4.38+/-0.43 to 2.99+/-0.29 in group A & B respectively over a period of 24 weeks. Lipid profile was also improved in both the groups. However, on comparing both the groups, no statistically significant difference was observed. Conclusion(s): There was a definite improvement in biochemical profile with both metformin and myo-inositol. Thus, myo-inositol can be a new addition in the armamentarium for the treatment of PCOS.Copyright © 2013 are reserved by International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research.

N2  - Objective To assess the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the parents of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients using carotid intima medial thickness (CIMT) and brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD). Design Hospital-based case-control study. Setting Endocrine clinic of a medical institute in India. Patient(s) Case group of 41 fathers and 45 mothers of PCOS patients (confirmed by Rotterdam's criteria) compared with 42 men and 44 women matched by age, sex and body mass index (BMI) as controls. Intervention(s) CVD risk in parents of PCOS patients assessed via CIMT and FMD then correlated with various clinical and metabolic parameters. Main Outcome Measure(s) Differences in CIMT and FMD between parents and controls. Result(s) The CIMT was higher [0.6 (0.54-0.8) vs. 0.5 (0.45-0.55) mm] and brachial artery FMD was lower [11.9% (6.9%-16.2%) vs. 16.7% (13.5%-22.6%)] in the parents of PCOS patients as compared with the controls. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose were higher in the parents of the PCOS patients. The prevalence of CVD risk factors such as systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, abdominal obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and a family history of coronary artery disease in first-degree relatives was also higher in the parents of PCOS patients. The prevalence of diabetes was higher in the fathers of PCOS women, but other cardiovascular disease risk factors, CIMT, and FMD were comparable among the mothers. Conclusion(s) The parents of PCOS patients have an increased CVD risk as evidenced by increased CIMT and low FMD.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disturbances in women and is divided into different phenotypes. The aim of study is to compare the clinical and hormonal parameters among the four phenotypes of PCOS based on the Rotterdam criteria and with control group. Method(s): Women with PCOS (n = 263) confirmed based on the Rotterdam criteria and 263 women with no evidence of PCOS were recruited as controls using observational case-control study. Evaluation of clinical and hormonal parameters, and differences in anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) were compared between four phenotypes of PCOS and controls. Result(s): Women with phenotype A (olig-anovulation (O) + hyperandrogenism (H) + polycystic ovary morphology (P)) had significantly larger waist than phenotype D (O + P) and higher body mass index than phenotype C (H + P). The LH/FSH ratio was significantly higher in phenotype A than phenotype D and controls along with significantly higher serum total testosterone levels in phenotype A compared to the phenotype B (O + H), C, D, and controls. AMH was significantly higher with phenotype A, C, and D than in women phenotype B and controls. Conclusion(s): The highest AMH levels were found in phenotype A. Phenotype B similar to controls had significantly low AMH compared to other three PCOS phenotypes. Women in the phenotypes D and controls showed significantly lower levels of LH/FSH ratio, total testosterone, and free androgen index, and higher levels of FSH and SHBG compared with phenotype A (P < 0.001). In logistic regression analysis, AMH and LH were predictors for PCOS.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Objective: We and others have observed that compared to age-matched controls, young girls who have a first-degree relative with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) display reduced insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function and insulin-mediated suppression of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA). The objective of our study was thus to assess whether the differences in these metabolic parameters observed during puberty between at-risk girls and controls persist after five years. Method(s): We compared 8 first-degree relatives to a woman with PCOS, either mother or sister (PCOSr), to 8 age-matched girls unrelated to PCOS, at baseline (8-14 y.o.) and at follow-up between 4 to 6 years later (13-21 y.o.). Evaluation visits included anthropometric measures, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSivGTT). We derived from the FSivGTT: insulin sensitivity index (SI), beta cell function (disposition index, DIFSivGTT) and indices of insulin-mediated suppression of NEFA, namely Logn-linear slope of NEFA and T50 of NEFA suppression. We calculated from the OGTT: insulin sensitivity index (ISIMatsuda) and an index of beta-cell function (DIOGTT = ISIMatsuda x CIR30). Data are presented as medians and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare groups or time periods. Result(s): After a follow-up of 5.4 years (similar between groups, p=0.84), participants had a mean age of 17.3 years (13.2-21.3). Tanner stages at follow-up were similar between groups (5 vs 5, p=0.06). At baseline, all metabolic parameters were worse in PCOSr when compared to controls, as previously published (Trottier A. et al, 2012). After 5 years, all differences in metabolic parameters disappeared, such as indices from the FSivGTT: SI=3.2 vs 3.4 (PCOSr vs controls, p=0.88), DIFSivGTT =1926 vs 1380 (p=0.44), Logn-linear slope of NEFA suppression (-0.032 vs -0.032, p=0.88) and T50 of NEFA suppression (18.1 vs 20.8 min, p=0.057). Likewise, results from the OGTT were similar between groups at follow-up: ISIMatsuda= 3.8 vs 3.6 (p=0.80) and DIOGTT=4,36 vs 2,74 (p=0.20). Metabolic parameters were relatively stable in PCOSr over 5 years (p>0.05 for difference with time), but deteriorated significantly in control girls (all p<0.05 for difference with time), except for Logn-linear slope of NEFA. BMI-z and waist circumference-to-height ratio did not change significantly with time within both groups (all p>0.05). Conclusion(s): In summary, our study demonstrates that metabolic deterioration observed during puberty in girls genetically predisposed to PCOS remains stable over 5 years, but control girls reach similar metabolic control than predisposed PCOS girls after puberty. Girls at risk of PCOS may thus display early but transient metabolic deterioration during puberty, which would therefore represent a window of transient metabolic alterations in these girls.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Women with PCOS are at increased risk of anxiety and depression, but there is limited data on the prevalence of eating disorders (ED) in this population. The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of ED in women with PCOS and associated risk factors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. MATERIALSANDMETHODS: Women with PCOS (Rotterdam Criteria; n=121) were recruited from an academic PCOS Center. Control subjects (n=57) had regular menses and no hirsutism and were receiving routine gynecologic care in the same time period. Both groups completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDEQ), Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). >=4 was clinically significant on the EDEQ, >= 25 on NEQ, and >= 11 on HADS. The PCOS group also completed the PCOS Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (PCOSQ). Fisher exact and two-tailed t tests were used for descriptive statistics. Multivariate logistic regression was used to control for confounders. RESULT(S): PCOS subjects were younger with a higher mean BMI compared to controls (Table). Global and all individual EDEQ scores were significantly higher in PCOS subjects compared to controls. EDEQ Global Score inversely correlated with overall PCOSQ score (r=-0.57, p=0.001) and with all PCOSQ domains, particularly emotion (r= -0.51, p<0.001) and weight (r= -0.79, p<0.0001). Women with PCOS had an increased odds of abnormal EDEQ Global Score >= 4 (OR=6.87, 95% CI 0.88- 53.86, p=0.04) however, the age and BMI-adjusted OR was 5.78 (CI 0.60-55.4, p<0.13). As expected, more women with PCOS had abnormal anxiety (41.7 vs 14%, p<0.001) and depressive scores (13.2 v. 3.5%, p=0.06) compared to controls. Among PCOS patients with anxiety, the odds ratio of EDEQ >= 4 was 9.70, 95%CI: 2.0, 46.1, p=0.004 compared to those without anxiety. This association increased after controlling for age and BMI (AOR 19.6, 95%CI 2.4-158.7, p=0.005). PCOS women with depression also had a greater odds of EDEQ >= 4 (OR: 3.84, 95%CI: 1.0- 14.6, p=0.048; age and BMI AOR: 3.96, 95%CI 1.0-15.6, p=0.049). The prevalences of bulimia, binge eating disorder, and night eating disorder in PCOS subjects were higher than in controls, but the differences were not statistically significant (Table). CONCLUSION(S): Our study demonstrates a significant increase in disordered eating attitudes and behaviors associated with decreased quality of life in women with PCOS. Further, it highlights the need to screen for eating disorders especially in women with PCOS and co-existing anxiety or depressive symptoms. (Table Presented).

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders that is associated with different metabolic, reproductive and psychological consequences. The main aim of this study was to compare the sexual function and quality of life in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and healthy women. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a causal-comparative study in which 129 women with polycystic ovary syndrome were qualified as the research group. The control group consisted of 125 healthy women. The sampling method was convenient and was done using Rotterdam criteria. Women of both research and control groups responded to the FSFI and WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires. Data were analyzed with SPSS software using MANOVA. Result(s): According to findings, all of quality of life subscales except environment domain were significantly lower in research group than healthy group (p < 0.01), but none of sexual function subscales were significantly different between two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Women with PCOS in term of some quality of life parameters have lower performance than healthy women. Therefore, it seems to be essential to increase awareness about symptoms and psychological consequences and referring process in order to take advantage of the advisory services.Copyright © 2016 Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS).

N2  - Background The composition of the diet is of increasing importance for the development and maturation of the ovarian follicles. In Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) healthy dietary interventions improve the clinical spectrum. We hypothesized that dieting and diet inadequacy in the reproductive life course is associated with impaired programming of ovarian follicles and contributes to the severity of the PCOS phenotype. Methods and Findings To determine associations between the use of a self-initiated diet and diet inadequacy and the severity of the PCOS phenotype, we performed an explorative nested case control study embedded in a periconception cohort of 1,251 patients visiting the preconception outpatient clinic. 218 patients with PCOS and 799 subfertile controls were selected from the cohort and self-administered questionnaires, anthropometric measurements and blood samples were obtained. The Preconception Dietary Risk Score (PDR score), based on the Dutch dietary guidelines, was used to determine diet inadequacy in all women. The PDR score was negatively associated to cobalamin, serum and red blood cell folate and positively to tHcy. PCOS patients (19.9%), in particular the hyperandrogenic (HA) phenotype (22.5%) reported more often the use of a self-initiated diet than controls (13.1%; p = 0.023). The use of an inadequate diet was also significantly higher in PCOS than in controls (PDR score 3.7 vs 3.5; p = 0.017) and every point increase was associated with a more than 1.3 fold higher risk of the HA phenotype (adjusted OR 1.351, 95% CI 1.09-1.68). Diet inadequacy was independently associated with the anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) concentration (beta 0.084; p = 0.044; 95% CI 0.002 to 0.165) and free androgen index (beta 0.128; p = 0.013; 95% CI 0.028 to 0.229) in PCOS patients. Conclusions The use of a self-initiated diet and diet inadequacy is associated with PCOS, in particular with the severe HA phenotype. This novel finding substantiated by the association between diet inadequacy and AMH needs further investigation.Copyright © 2015 Huijgen et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in women. It may involve an impairment in physiologic regulation of leptin and ghrelin. There is limited, controversial data on the relation of dietary components with leptin and ghrelin in PCOS, so the current study has been conducted to explore the effects of different macronutrients on serum levels of leptin and ghrelin in PCOS and healthy subjects. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case-control study, we randomly choose 30 PCOS patients and 30 healthy age and body mass index (BMI) matched controls. Intake of macronutrients [protein, total fat, saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), carbohydrate, dietary fiber] and energy were assessed using 3-day, 24-hour food recall and food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). Fasting hormonal status was measured for each participant. Result(s): PCOS women had higher levels of serum leptin, insulin, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH), whereas sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was lower compared to healthy women. There was no significant difference in mean ghrelin concentrations between the groups. Among PCOS women, independent of BMI and total energy intake, we observed an inverse association between leptin concentration and total dietary fat (beta=-0.16, P<0.05) and saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake (beta=-0.58, P<0.05). This relationship was not seen in the healthy subjects. There was no significant association between ghrelin and macronutrients in PCOS and healthy participants. Conclusion(s): Certain habitual dietary components such as fat and SFA may decrease serum leptin, whereas ghrelin is not influenced by these in PCOS women. More studies are needed to better clarify the effects of dietary macronutrients on serum leptin and ghrelin.Copyright © 2015, Royan Institute (ACECR). All rights reserved.

T1  - Risk Factors Associated with the Malignant Changes of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Endometrial Polyps in Premenopausal Women
A1  - Elfayomy A.K.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of premalignant and malignant lesions of symptomatic and asymptomatic endometrial polyps among premenopausal women and to verify whether different clinical parameters, and polyp volume and number are associated with a more precise estimate of malignancy. Method(s): One hundred and fifty women aged 29-52 years and with certain diagnosis of endometrial polyp were enrolled in a prospective observational study. The recruited patients underwent hysteroscopic polypectomy based on saline infusion sonohysterography and diagnostic hysteroscopy. Pathologic report was the main outcome. Result(s): Among women with endometrial polyps, 62 % had asymptomatic polyps. The prevalence of premalignant and malignant polyps comprised 4.6 % of cases (3.3 % hyperplasia with atypia and 1.3 % carcinomatous polyps). The presence of abnormal uterine bleeding was not a predictor of premalignant and malignant changes in the polyp. On logistic regression analysis, the premalignant and malignant lesions were influenced by polycystic ovary syndrome (p < 0.001; OR 4.61; CI 1.9-27), polyp volume >10 ml (p < 0.001; OR 5.83; CI 4.31-9.17), and multiple polyps (p = 0. 01; OR 2.05; CI 1.09-3.76). Notably, the odds ratio of polyp volume >10 ml was 5.83. This additional risk confirms the importance of polyp volume in the detection of malignant transformation rather than associating bleeding in premenopausal women. Conclusion(s): Polycystic ovary syndrome, polyp volume greater than 10 ml, and increased polyp number represent the markers of risk for premalignant and malignant transformation of endometrial polyps in premenopausal women. Nonetheless, the majority of polyps are asymptomatic, and the risk of malignancy is very low. Therefore, for women with polyp volume <=10 ml and no risk factors, a more expectant approach may be warranted in order to reduce surgical risks and costs.Copyright © 2014, Federation of Obstetric & Gynecological Societies of India.

N2  - Introduction: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a syndrome of heterogeneous nature, affecting multiple systems, particularly the endocrine system. We propose to investigate the possible relationships among hormonal changes, levels of anxiety, depression, and anger in patients with PCOS., Method: Forty-four female patients with PCOS and 44 body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy women participated in this study. We measured the sociodemographic features, some serum hormonal levels (insulin, gonadotropins, prolactin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), 17 OH-progesterone, and total and free testosterone), and some other biochemical parameters of the participants. Also, all participants completed the Trait Anger-Anger Expression Scale (STAS), Beck Depression, and Beck Anxiety Inventories. We evaluated the psychiatric scale scores obtained from PCOS patients and control subjects. We used the independent-samples t-test for parametric data to evaluate normal distribution, and Mann-Whitney U-test was used for both abnormally distributed and nonparametric data. We used Pearson correlation analysis to evaluate the potential connection between the two groups' data., Results: The mean ages of the patients with PCOS and control subjects who participated in this study were 27.3+/-5.6 and 27.4+/-6.1 years, respectively. The measures of BMI, insulin, luteinizing hormone (LH), DHEAS, and total testosterone serum levels in the patient group were significantly higher than in the control group (p<0.05). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between Beck anxiety scores and serum DHEAS levels (Pearson r=0.4366, P=0.0001). We found significant differences between the two groups in terms of trait anger, anger control, outward and inward anger, anxiety level, and depression scores (P<0.05)., Conclusion: Anxiety symptoms indicate a stronger relationship compared to depression with DHEAS serum levels via the autonomic nervous system, considering the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-antagonistic effect of DHEAS. Obesity, hirsutism, and infertility may reduce self-confdence and create depressive symptoms in patients with PCOS. In addition, changes in hormonal levels may lead to anxiety directly. Possibly, depressive symptoms are a secondary refection of these changes.Copyright © 2014 by Turkish Association of Neuropsychiatry.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on the outcomes of IVF/ICSI treatment cycles in Chinese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS (n = 128) and tubal factor (n = 128) underwent a conventional long GnRH agonist suppressive protocol. Women with PCOS had significantly more oocytes retrieved (P < 0.05) and available embryos (P < 0.05), as compared to patients with tubal infertility. No significant differences were observed in clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and live birth rate between two groups. Patients were further divided into two subgroups. In total, 49 patients in PCOS group and 19 patients in tubal factor group were overweight or obese (BMI = 24 kg/m2). Lean women (BMI < 24 kg/m2) with PCOS showed higher clinical pregnancy rate (P < 0.05). Live birth rate and miscarriage rate were also higher in lean PCOS women, but the differences were not significant. Similar clinical outcomes of IVF/ICSI success were achieved between two subgroups in tubal factor patients. In conclusion, lean PCOS patients obtained higher clinical pregnancy rate compared with overweight/obese PCOS patients in Chinese populations.Copyright © 2014, Int J Clin Exp Med. All right reserved.

The present study was designed to determine the obstetric and neonatal outcome in PCOS with GDM. Material(s) and Method(s): A case-control study was conducted involving 261 GDM women. Thirty hundredone cases had PCOS based on Rotterdam criteria and the other thirty hundred cases (control group) were women without PCOS. The subjects in each group were evaluated regarding obstetric and those women whose documentation's were complete entered the study. Result(s): In present study, women with PCOS and GDM had more than twofold increased odds of preeclampsia (p = 0.003, CI = 1.56-5.01, and OR = 2.8) and PIH (p= 0.04, CI = 1.28-4.5, and OR= 2.4). Maternal PCOS and GDM were also associated with threefold increased odds of neonatal hypoglycemia (p= 0.004, CI= 1.49-6.58, and OR= 3.13). Conclusion(s): Our finding emphasized that pregnant PCOS patients should be followed carefully for the occurrence of various pregnancy and neonatal complications including hypertension and hypoglycemia. We suggested that these neonates should be given more care regarding hypoglycemia symptoms.

N2  - Background: This study was designed to investigate the effect of metformin and flutamide alone or in combination with anthropometric indices and laboratory tests of obese/overweight PCOS women under hypocaloric diet. Method(s): This single blind clinical trial was performed on 120 PCOS women. At the beginning, hypocaloric diet was recommended for the patients. After one month while they were on the diet, the patients were randomly divided in 4 groups; metformin (500 mg, 3/day), flutamide (250 mg, 2/day), combined, metformin (500 mg, 3/day) with flutamide (250 mg, 2/day) and finally placebo group. The patients were treated for 6 months. Anthropometric indices and laboratory tests (fasting and glucose-stimulated insulin levels, lipid profile and androgens) were measured. A one-way ANOVA (Post Hoc) and paired t-test were performed to analyze data. A p<=0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): After treatment, reduction in weight, BMI, hip circumference was significantly greater in the metformin group in comparison to other groups (p<0.05). In addition, the fasting insulin was significantly greater in metformin group and flutamide group in comparison to metformin+flutamide and placebo groups after treatment (p<0.05). Within groups, insulin level showed significant changes (before and after treatment) in metformin+flutamide group and LDL reduction was significant in flutamide group before and after treatment. Post hoc tukey and two-tailed with p<=0.05 were used to define statistical significance. Conclusion(s): Using combination of metformin and flutamide improves anthropometric indices and laboratory tests in obese/overweight PCOS women under hypocaloric diet.Copyright © 2014, Avicenna Research Institute.

N2  - We have previously shown that sons of PCOS women (PCOSs) exhibit higher body weight since early infancy. In addition, insulin resistance became evident as the subjects got older. These metabolic derangements were not observed in the daughters of PCOS women. It is accepted that family influences (epigenetic and genetic factors) play a role in determining eating behavior and childhood obesity. Moreover, in the case of the PCOS condition, it is posible that the mother may protect the daughters and not the boys against over eating. Our objective was to evaluate different metabolic parameters in PCOSs during prepuberty and early puberty and to asses the eating behavior using the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ ). Design(s): Twelve PCOSs and 25 controls were included. Controls were selected from public schools near our academic Unit . We performed a complete physical examination and pubertal development assessment according to Tanner stage, on each boy. Anthropometric measurements included: weight, height,waist, hip, BMI and BMI SD score. A 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test was performed with measurement of glucose and insulin, and serum lipids in the basal sample. Result(s): Age, weight, height, BMISDS were not different between both groups. Waist to hip ratio was significant higher in the PCOSs group. Glucose concentration were higher in PCOSs compared to controls. Regarding CEBQ, PCOSs showed a significant higher score in the subscale "food responsiveness" meaning a high preference for more tasty food compared to controls. In a simple linear regression analysis BMI was positively correlated with the subscale "food responsiveness" (r=0.52, p=0.05) in PCOSs. In the controls BMI were positively correlated with the subscale "enjoyment of food" (r= 0.47, p= 0.02) and the subscale "food responsiveness" (r= 0.51, p= 0.01). This study indicate that sons of PCOS women exhibit metabolic derangements during the prepubertal and early pubertal period associated with a higher preference for more tasty food compared to controls. In both groups, BMI correlated with a positive inclination for eating, reflecting an increase in the prevalence of obesity in chilean boys as a consequence of social changes leading to a rise in consumption of high-calorie foods and sedentary habits.

N2  - Introduction: This study aimed to assess the metabolic parameters and androgen concentration in the cord blood of newborns of mothers with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in comparison with controls. Material(s) and Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2010-2011 in Isfahan, Iran. Biochemical tests were conducted on 40 infants, born from singleton pregnancies in women with PCOS and an equal number of controls. Result(s): The mean weight gain during pregnancy was higher in women with PCOS than in controls (16.02+/-4.39 vs. 9.10+/-2.20 kg, respectively, p<0.0001). The mean birth weight was lower in newborns of mothers with PCOS than in controls (2905.25+/-415.59 vs. 3223.25+/-425.02 vs. grams, respectively, p=0.001). The mean testosterone was higher in cord blood of newborns of PCOS women than in controls (5.58+/-3.20 vs. 2.28+/-0.62 pg/ml, p<0.0001). Triglycerides and LDL-C were lower in cord blood of newborns, born from PCOS women than in controls (p=0.001). The birth weight of the newborns of PCOS mothers was negatively correlated to free testosterone of cord blood (R=-0.26, p=0.04). Conclusion(s): The metabolic aberration in PCOS might influence fetal birth weight and cord blood lipid profile. These disorders may be caused by an exposure to elevated testosterone level during fetal life. The offspring of PCOS women may be at higher risk for chronic diseases in later life. The clinical impact of our findings should be confirmed in future longitudinal studies.

N2  - First-degree female relatives (FDRs) of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are at substantially increased risk for PCOS. Although PCOS cannot be diagnosed until after menarche, reproductive and metabolic abnormalities are present earlier in FDRs. We reported -cell dysfunction and hyperandrogenemia in early pubertal FDR compared to control girls. This cohort was followed prospectively to investigate the evolution of these abnormalities. Twelve FDR and 10 control (CON) girls aged 8-12 y, breast Tanner Stage (bTS) I-III, BMI >85th- -98th percentile were studied at Year 1 (mean age 10.0 y, mean bTS II); 7 FDR and 8 CON returned at Year 2 (mean age 10.9 y, mean bTS III), and 6 FDR and 8 CON returned at Year 3 (mean age 11.5 y, mean bTS IV). Insulin sensitivity and secretion were assessed by frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance testing. The groups were of similar age, bTS and BMI Z-score for the duration of the study. Three FDRs had dysglycemia at baseline. All CON had normal glucose tolerance at baseline by design. Two dysglycemic FDRs did not participate in the prospective study. Impaired glucose tolerance normalized by Year 2 in one FDR. The significant decrease in disposition index (DI), the product of acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) and insulin sensitivity index (SI), persisted over 3 years in FDR compared to CON girls (P=0.003). SI and visceral adipose tissue volume did not differ significantly between the groups. Data on age at menarche was available for 9 FDRs. Eight of 9 FDRs were postmenarchal, with a mean age at menarche of 12.1 years, similar to the average age of menarche in the US of 12.0 years according to 2007-2008 NHANES data. The significant increases in testosterone (T) levels in FDR compared to CON girls at Year 1 did not persist in Years 2 and 3 as CON T levels increased. Sex hormone binding globulin, DHEAS and androstenedione levels did not differ between the groups at any time point. In conclusion, DI, the most powerful predictor of type 2 diabetes risk, remains significantly decreased in FDR girls during puberty. These findings suggest that there are persistent defects in -cell function in PCOS FDR girls. Further, DI is decreased without significant decreases in SI suggesting that -cell dysfunction precedes insulin resistance. Accordingly, therapies targeting insulin secretion rather than insulin action may be more successful for diabetes prevention in girls at risk for PCOS.

N2  - Introduction: PCOS is a syndrome of the heterogeneous nature, affecting multiple systems, particularly the endocrine system. We propose to investigate the possible relationships among hormonal changes, levels of anxiety, depression, and anger in patients with PCOS. Method(s): Fourty four female patients with PCOS and 44 BMI (Body Mass Index)-matched healthy women participated in this study. We measured the sociodemographic features, some serum hormonal levels (insulin, gonadotropins, prolactin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), TSH, T3, T4, 17 OH-Progesterone, total and free testosterone) and some other biochemical parameters of the participants. Also, all participants completed Trait Anger-Anger Expression Scale (STAS), Beck Depression and Beck Anxiety Inventories. Result(s): The mean ages of the patients with PCOS and control subjects were 27.3 +/- 5.6 and 27.4 +/- 6.1 years, respectively. The measures of BMI, insulin, LH, DHEAS, and total testosterone serum levels in the patient group were significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.05). There was statistically significant positive correlation between BAI scores and DHEAS levels. We found significant differences between two groups in terms of trait anger, anger control, anger outward and inward, anxiety level and depression scores (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Anxiety symptoms indicate stronger relationship compared to the depression with the DHEAS serum levels via autonomic nervous system, considering GABA antagonistic effect of DHEAS. Obesity, hirsutism, and infertility may reduce selfconfidence, and create depressive symptoms in patients with PCOS. In addition, changes in the hormonal levels may lead to anxiety directly. Possibly, depressive symptoms are a secondary reflection of these changes.

The aim of this study was investigating the effect of aerobic training on obesity status, insulin resistance and serum levels of anti-mullerian hormone in PCOS patients. Method(s): This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 22 PCOS women who referred to Kosar clinic in Arak, Iran in 2012. Patients were randomly divided into aerobic training and control groups. The exercise protocol consisted of aerobic training 3 days per week for 8 weeks. At weeks 0 and 8,fasting blood samples and anthropometric measurements were collected. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 15 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov and dependent t-test. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Result(s): Body weight (p<0.002), body mass index (p<0.05), waist circumference (p<0.001), total cholesterol and triglyceride levels (p<0.02) were significantly decreased in training group, whereas VO2 peak increased by exercise (p<0.05). Changes in serum anti-mullerian levels and insulin resistance index were not significant in either of the groups (p>0.05). Conclusion(s): Aerobic training improves metabolic and morphological status in PCOS patients. This beneficial effect is not associated with alteration in serum anti-mullerian hormone levels.

N2  - Background: This study aimed to assess the metabolic parameters and androgen concentration in the cord blood of newborns of mothers with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in comparison with controls. Material(s) and Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2010-2011 in Isfahan, Iran. Biochemical tests were conducted on 40 infants, born from singleton pregnancies in women with PCOS and an equal number of controls. Result(s): The mean weight gain during pregnancy was higher in women with PCOS than in controls (16.02 +/- 4.39 vs. 9.10 +/- 2.20 kg, respectively, P < 0.0001). The mean birth weight was lower in newborns of mothers with PCOS than in controls (2905.25 +/- 415.59 vs. 3223.25 +/- 425.02 vs. grams, respectively, P = 0.001). The mean testosterone was higher in cord blood of newborns of PCOS women than in controls (5.58 +/- 3.20 vs. 2.28 +/- 0.62 pg/ml, P < 0.0001). Triglycerides and LDL-C were lower in cord blood of newborns, born from PCOS women than in controls (P = 0.001). The birth weight of the newborns of PCOS mothers was negatively correlated to free testosterone of cord blood (R = -0. 26, P = 0.04). Conclusion(s): The metabolic aberration in PCOS might influence fetal birth weight and cord blood lipid profile. These disorders may be caused by an exposure to elevated testosterone level during fetal life. The offspring of PCOS women may be at higher risk for chronic diseases in later life. The clinical impact of our findings should be confirmed in future longitudinal studies.

N2  - Background: First-degree relatives (FDRs) of women with PCOS are at increased risk for impaired insulin sensitivity and diabetes mellitus. Glucose tolerant FDR have evidence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia prior to emergence of frank PCOS. Aim(s): To study insulin dynamics parameters in the early adolescent FDR of women with PCOS. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional study involving 18 adolescents whose mothers or sisters had been diagnosed with PCOS and 21 healthy, age-matched control adolescents without FDR. Subjects underwent anthropometric measurements, steroid profiling and frequently sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test (IVGTT), Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) index, Glucose Disposal Index (GDI), Acute Insulin Response (AIR) and Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were derived from IVGTT results. Result(s): FDRs showed significantly higher mean HOMA and lower GDI. There were no differences in mean age or BMI Z-score between the cohorts. No differences in sex steroids or AIR were identified between groups. Conclusion(s): Female adolescent FDR of women with PCOS have higher HOMA index and lower QUICKI, reflecting altered insulin sensitivity and lower GDI reflecting poorer beta-cell function. The presence of multiple risk factors for type 2 diabetes suggests that aggressive screening of the early adolescent FDR of women with PCOS is indicated. © 2012 Raissouni et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - First-degree female relatives (FDRs) of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are at substantially increased risk for PCOS. Although PCOS cannot be diagnosed until adolescence, there is emerging evidence that the process may begin earlier. We investigated the development of reproductive and metabolic abnormalities in peripubertal PCOS FDRs.Twelve FDRs and 16 control (CON) girls aged 8-12 years, breast Tanner Stage I-III, BMI >85th- <=98th percentile were studied. Oral (OGTT, 12 FDR, 13 CON) and frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance testing (FSIGT, 11 FDR, 9 CON) were performed in a subgroup. Insulin sensitivity (SI), acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg), disposition index (DI) and glucose effectiveness (SG) were determined by minimal model analysis. Two-tailed t-tests or nonparametric tests were applied as appropriate, data mean+/-SD.Age did not differ but BMI Z-score was slightly higher in the CON (P=0.03). Three FDRs had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT); one also had impaired fasting glucose. All CON had normal glucose tolerance by design. Total testosterone (T) measured by LC-MS/MS (14+/-4 FDR v 9+/-8 CON ng/dL, P=0.0012) and bioavailable T (uT) (6+/-3 FDR v 3+/-4 CON ng/dL, P=0.0007) levels were significantly increased in FDRs. Sex hormone binding globulin, DHEAS and androstenedione levels did not differ between the groups.Age and BMI Z-Score (P=0.168) were similar in the FSIGT subgroup. There was a trend toward decreased SI (1.98+/-1.23 FDRs v 2.54+/-1.07 CON, P=0.111) in the FDR group. AIRg and SG were similar in both groups. However, DI, the most powerful known predictor of type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk, was significantly lower in FDRs (2152+/-1400 FDRs v 4026+/-2249 CON, P=0.0119). These differences remained significant (P=0.027) when FDRs with dysglycemia were excluded from the analysis.This is the first report of evidence for beta-cell dysfunction in PCOS FDR children. Further, these FDRs are among the youngest age group in whom defects in insulin secretion have been identified. These defects can occur in the absence of IGT in FDRs as they can in adult women with PCOS. T and uT levels were also increased in FDRs at earlier pubertal stages than previously reported. In contrast to prior studies, DHEAS levels did not differ in FDRs. Thus, the source of elevated T in FDRs is unclear. In conclusion, hyperandrogenemia and decreased insulin secretion are present in peripubertal PCOS FDRs.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder that affects various body organs and requires comprehensive long term evaluation and management. The aim of this study was to evaluate effect of Flutamide on ovulation induction in PCOS patients. Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective study applied triple blind method, a simple convenience sampling method, to induce ovulations of the ninety six PCOS patients. Patients were divided into two groups; group A included 53 subjects (received Flutamide + Clomiphene Citrate) and group B included 43 subjects (received placebo + Clomiphene Citrate). Ultrasound was carried to determine the size of follicles and growth rate of them during follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Also, progesterone levels were measured on days 19 and 21 of the menstrual cycle. Result(s): In this study, ninety six PCOS patients, in two treatment and control groups, were evaluated regarding to body mass index (BMI), cycle irregularity, age and number of dominant follicles, duration of stimulation, endocrine profile and score of hirsutism. The obtained results revealed no significant differences between two groups. Conclusion(s): Flutamide does not affect ovulation improvement in PCOS patients undergoing induction.

N2  - Objectives: To compare the efficacy of letrozole and clomiphene citrate (CC) in patients of anovulatory polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) with infertility. Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective randomized clinical trial included 204 patients of PCOS. 98 patients (294 cycles) received 2.5-5 mg of letrozole; 106 patients (318 cycles) received 50-100 mg of CC (both orally from Days 3-7 of menstrual cycle). The treatment continued for three cycles in both the groups. Main Outcome Measure(s): ovulation rate, endometrial thickness, and pregnancy rate. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 13 software. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Result(s): The mean number of dominant follicles in letrozole groups and CC groups was 1.860.26 and 1.920.17, respectively (P=0.126). Number of ovulatory cycle in letrozole group was 196 (66.6%) versus 216 (67.9%) in CC group (P=0.712). The mean mid-cycle endometrial thickness was 9.10.3 mm in letrozole group and 6.31.1 in CC group, which was statistically significant (P=0.014). The mean Estradiol [E2] level in clomiphene citrate group was significantly higher in CC group (364.271.4 pg/mL) than letrozole group (248.2 42.2 pg/mL). 43 patients from the letrozole group (43.8%) and 28 patients from the CC group (26.4%) became pregnant. Conclusion(s): Letrozole and CC have comparable ovulation rate. The effect of letrozole showed a better endometrial response and pregnancy rate compared with CC.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) often are infertile and even if they become pregnant, there are complications with some adverse outcomes. It has been reported that aspirin and metformin improve uteroplacental circulation and reduce pregnancy complications. Objective(s): To determine and compare uteroplacental circulation and obstetrics complications in pregnant women with PCOS treated with metformin, aspirin and control group. Material(s) and Method(s): 105 pregnant women with PCOS were enrolled in this study after assessing uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) with Doppler ultrasonography at 12 weeks of gestation. The patients were divided into three groups and received metformin 2000 mg or aspirin 80 mg daily, or no intervention until the end of pregnancy. PI was assessed for the patients at 20 week of gestation and groups were followed up till delivery. PI and obstetrics complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm labor, preeclampsia and IUGR were compared among groups. Result(s): All groups had significant reduction in the mean uterine artery PI at 20 weeks measurement (p<0.05), but this reduction was more in metformin and aspirin groups than control group (p=0.002). There was a significant difference in mean uterine artery PI 20 week of gestation in three groups (p=0.005). Adverse outcomes have seen 4 out of 35 in metformin group, 7 out of 35 in aspirin group and 11 out of 35 in control group. There weren't significant differences among groups (p=0.12). Conclusion(s): Metformin and low dose aspirin reduced uterine artery impedance but there was not associated with reduced obstetrics complication in women with PCOS.

N2  - Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is defined by hyperandrogenism and ovarian dysfunction, but is also characterised by insulin resistance (IR) and high levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA). Previous results suggest that IR and/or NEFA spillover may contribute to the hyperandrogenemia of PCOS women. PCOS also seems to be genetically determined because of its higher frequency in relatives. The goal of this study was to verify whether metabolic and endocrine perturbations develop early in adolescent girls genetically linked to PCOS. Method(s): We studied 9 adolescent girls having a relative (mother or sister) diagnosed with PCOS (PCOSr) and 10 adolescent girls with no PCOS relative. Anthropometry and pubertal development (Tanner) stage were assessed. A 2h oral glucose tolerance test and a 3h frequently sampled intra-venous glucose tolerance test (FSivGTT) were performed. Insulin sensitivity (IS) was determined using the minimal model during FSivGTT (ISFSIVGTT). Several adipokines, NEFA and androgens were assayed during these procedures. Insulin-induced NEFA suppression (NEFNEFAsupp) was estimated by the negative slope of decreasing NEFA levels (on log scale) during the first 20 minutes of FSivGTT. Groups were compared with Wilcoxon tests and correlations were verified by Spearman tests. Adjustments were made by ANCOVA, using log-transformed variables when required. Result(s): In comparison to controls, PCOSr had higher body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (P<0.05), increased fat mass (P=0.09) and decreased ISFSIVGTT (P=0.003). Leptin levels during OGTT were determined by adiposity. Levels of the androgen 17OH-progesterone (17Pg) were increased in PCOSr (P=0.03), independently of adiposity (Ps<=0.05) or Tanner stage (<=2 vs >2), but not of ISFSIVGTT. Indeed, 17Pg was strongly correlated with ISFSIVGTT (P=0.0003) even after correction for Tanner stage (P=0.0007). Finally, NEFNEFAsupp was decreased in PCOSr (P=0.004) as compared to controls, independently of Tanner stage (P=0.02), adiposity (Ps<=0.01), 17Pg (P=0.050) or BMI & 17Pg (P=0.047). NEFNEFAsupp was also correlated with ISFSIVGTT (P=0.018). Conclusion(s): Adolescent girls at high risk of developing PCOS demonstrate elevated adiposity, IR for glucose metabolism and hyperandrogenemia, but are mainly characterized by resistance to insulin-induced lipolysis, independently of adiposity. We thus report the first evidence that genetic predisposition to PCOS may be related to early adipocyte dysfunction.

N2  - Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) was first introduced by Leventhal and Stein in 1935. It has a wide range of manifestations such as hyperandrogenism, irregular menstruation and central body obesity. The lack of definite diagnostic criteria has made the diagnosis a difficult task. Moreover, the disturbing aspects of the syndrome range from hirsutism in an adolescent girl to infertility in a young woman. Based on the Rotterdam 2003 Criteria, current diagnostic criteria must include two of the following three symptoms: 1. Either oligo-ovulation or anovulation, 2. Clinical or laboratory manifestations of hyperandrogenism, 3. Polycystic ovaries on sonographic examination (more than 12 follicles of less than 10 mm in diameter in each ovary). In this study, we have focused on the enrollment of a large sample size to assess the prevalence and clinical features of PCOS such that a wide range of basic information can be utilized for further investigations. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study with multi-stage random sampling. Subjects were selected from 15-18 years old girls from a number of high schools in Tehran. After interview and clinical examination, those individuals with either menstrual irregularities, hirsutism or obesity were referred for further laboratory evaluations and abdominal sonography in order to diagnose PCOS and estimate its prevalence. We also aimed to assess the predominant features of this disorder among adolescents. Result(s): The overall prevalence of the syndrome was 3.42%. Out of the 1430 girls, 49 were diagnosed with PCOS. Conclusion(s): Despite its high prevalence, this syndrome has not been widely studied. Most of the conducted studies have enrolled small samples within a short time period. Thus, more accurate policy making in this regard can be achieved through definition of the prevalence of PCOS and accurate estimation of its burden.

N2  - The aim of the study is to compare the pregnancy outcome, especially the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus in a group of patients with PCOS, with a group of healthy weight matched women. Retrospectively we evaluated the pregnancies of 56 women with PCOS some of who had been treated for infertility. These were compared with a group of 56 age and weight matched controls. Incidence of Pregnancy induced hypertension in cases of PCOS was 14.2 % (8/56), gestational diabetes was 14.2 % (8/56) IHCP 10.7% (6/56) as compared of age and weight matched controls is with the incidence of PIH was 7.10% (4/56), GDM 3.5% (2/56) IHCP 7% (4/ 56).The differences in the incidence of GDM & PIH in two groups was not significant. The outcome of pregnancy in controls & the test groups were not significant, though numerically found to be heigher.Thereby, suggesting PCOS must be screened for comorbid conditions like PIH, GDM &IHCP.

N2  - Objective: In this study, we compared healthy women with women having polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) for the levels of depression, anxiety, and ways of coping skills. Material(s) and Method(s): A cross-sectional study was designed. We examined 35 women with PCOS and 35 healthy women between January 2006 and January 2007. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Ways of Coping Inventory (WCI) were used for psychological assessment. Result(s): Women with PCOS had significantly higher scores on the BDI and STAI. Among the subtests of WCI, both helplessness and self-blaming and accepting responsibility subscales of the PCOS patients were significantly higher than those of the control group. Discussion(s): Our results indicated that there could be an association between psychosocial characters of the individual and PCOS. Further studies are needed to characterize this association.

N2  - Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common metabolism and endocrine disorders among women. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of metformin on lipid profile changes, insulin resistance, body mass index (BMI), Ovulation and pregnancy rates in patients affected by PCO syndrome. Material(s) and Method(s): In this randomized controlled study, 200 women aged 20-35 years with PCOS were selected. Diagnostic criteria were based on the diagnostic criteria of PCO syndrome in Noterdam meeting in 2003. Samples of fasting peripheral blood were taken from all patients to test cholesterol, LDL, HDL, TG, FBS and Insulin before treatment. Patients were then divided randomly into two groups. In case group (n=100), metformin was prescribed three times a day (1500 mg daily) and in control group (n=100), placebo was administered in the same way. After three months, sample of blood was taken again in order to test the variance of the above mentioned parameters to compare with these amounts before test. Also, BMI was compared before and after treatment in both groups. Result(s): BMI was 28.81+/-3.18 and 29.49 +/- 4.7 Kg/m2 before treatment in case and control groups respectively. This ratio changed after treatment to 28.45 +/- 2.8 and 29.29 +/- 4.8 Kg/m2 in case and control groups respectively (P-value>0.05). FSH/insulin ratio was 4.67+/-0.9 and 5.03+/-1.3 in case and control group respectively, while it changed after treatment to 6.07 +/- 1.4 and 5.05 +/-1.3 and this difference was significant in case group (P-value=0.0001),but it was no difference in control group. In case group, HDL level increased after treatment from 26.65+/-9.9 to 33.19+/- 9.9 MMoL/L (P-value=0.0001), and Triglyceride level decreased after treatment from 208.96+/-58.9 to 191.54+/-55.4 MMoL/L (P-value=0.004); whereas there was no change in control group. LDL and cholesterol levels did not change in both groups. Ovulation rate and pregnancy rate were significantly higher in case group than in control group (86% vs. 20%) (P-value=0.003) and (40% vs. 11%) (P=0.021) respectively. In addition, Metformin had no significant effect on BMI in case group. Conclusion(s): Treatment with metformin during 3 months causes not only the increase in ovulation and pregnancy rates but also the decrease in insulin resistance and lipid profile changes.

N2  - Overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were randomized to a high protein (HP; 40% carbohydrate and 30% protein; n = 14) or a low protein (LP; 55% carbohydrate and 15% protein) diet (n = 14). The intervention consisted of 12 wk of energy restriction (~6000 kJ/d), followed by 4 wk of weight maintenance. Pregnancies (two HP and one LP); improvements in menstrual cyclicity, lipid profile, and insulin resistance (as measured by the homeostasis model); and decreases in weight (7.5%) and abdominal fat (12.5%) occurred independently of diet composition. Improvements in menstrual cyclicity were associated with greater decreases in insulin resistance and fasting insulin (P = 0.011). On the LP diet, high density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased 10% during energy restriction (P = 0.008), and the free androgen index increased 44% in weight maintenance stages (P = 0.027). Weight loss leads to improvements in cardiovascular and reproductive parameters potentially mediated by improvements in surrogate measures of insulin resistance. An HP weight loss diet may result in minor differential endocrine and metabolic improvements.

N2  - In the last few years some studies assessed the effects of attenuation of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, obtained by insulin sensitizing agents, in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), suggesting potential scope for these drugs in treating the whole spectrum of reproductive, endocrine, and metabolic abnormalities found in such subjects. However, the results of these studies, mostly uncontrolled and short-term, are still inconclusive, and there is no long-term follow-up. In the present study, 23 PCOS subjects [mean (+/- SE) body mass index 30.0 +/- 1.1 kg/m2] were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with metformin (500 mg tid) or placebo for 6 months, while maintaining their usual eating habits. Before and after treatment, menstrual history, endocrine and metabolic profiles, serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone response to GnRH-agonist testing, and insulin sensitivity measured by the glucose clamp technique were assessed. Eighteen of these women, as well as 14 additional PCOS patients, were subsequently given metformin in an open trial for 11.0 +/- 1.3 months (range 4-26), to assess long-term effects of treatment and baseline predictors of metformin efficacy on reproductive abnormalities. After metformin treatment, mean frequency of menstruation improved (P = 0.002), due to striking amelioration of menstrual abnormalities in about 50% of subjects. Women given metformin showed reduced plasma insulin (at fasting: P = 0.057; during the clamp studies: P < 0.01) and increased insulin sensitivity (P < 0.05). Concurrently, ovarian hyperandrogenism was attenuated, as indicated by significant reductions in serum free testosterone (P < 0.05) and in the 17-hydroxyprogesterone response to GnRH-agonist testing (P < 0.05). No changes were found in the placebo group. Only comparable minor changes in body mass index were found both in the metformin group and in the placebo group. In the open, long-term trial 17 women (54.8%) showed striking improvements of their menstrual abnormalities and were considered as responders. Logistic regression analysis of baseline characteristics in responders and nonresponders showed that plasma insulin, serum androstenedione, and menstrual history were independent predictors of the treatment's clinical efficacy. In 10 subjects whose menses proved regular after treatment, the great majority of cycles became ovulatory (32 out of 39 assessed, 79%). In conclusion, in women with PCOS metformin treatment reduced hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenemia, independently of changes in body weight. In a large number of subjects these changes were associated with striking, sustained improvements in menstrual abnormalities and resumption of ovulation. Higher plasma insulin, lower serum androstenedione, and less severe menstrual abnormalities are baseline predictors of clinical response to metformin.
